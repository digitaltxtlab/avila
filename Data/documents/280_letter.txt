1. Jesus be with your honor and grant you a joyful ending of the Christmas celebration and an entry into the new year as happy as the one you procured for me with such good news. For two days previous to the arrival of your letters I was greatly afflicted because of the ones Pedro Ries had delivered. On the morning of the feast of St. John, that other message arrived which consoled us to no end. Blessed be God for such a great favor. I tell you that compared to it, the rest is less painful; although it would console me very much to see the two fathers free. I hope in the Lord that since he granted us this favor he will grant the rest.
2. As for the establishment of a province, may His Majesty do what he sees is necessary. May God reward you for what you did for me by informing the licentiate about the money and all the rest. And even though more was promised, it doesn't matter to me. This will be enough until we receive an answer. As soon as the amount is paid, let me know and I will reimburse you without fail.
3. I beg you to have the enclosed letters hand delivered, for that would be fitting. And always inform me of the receipt of the letters I send you, for otherwise I worry about them, and with good reason. Consider it very important that all these letters be delivered with caution. When I see our fathers free, these other things will not trouble me much, for God will do things better than we can; this is his work.
Give my regards to Señora Inés and to those ladies.
Today is Sunday, feast of the Holy Innocents.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
