1. One night I was very distressed because it had been a long time since I had heard from my Father, and he had not been well when he last wrote. My affliction though was not like it had been when I first heard of his illness; for now I had confidence, and I was never as distressed as I had been the first time. But my concern hindered my prayer. He suddenly appeared to me, and in such a way that it couldn't have been my imagination. For a light appeared in the interior of my soul, and I beheld him coming along the road, happy and with a white countenance. Although by reason of the light by which I saw he had to have a white countenance, it seems to me that so do all those who are in heaven. And I wondered if the light and brilliance that comes from our Lord makes them white. I heard: "Tell him to begin at once without fear, for his is the victory."
2. The day after he came, while I was praising our Lord at night for having granted me so many favors, the Lord said to me: "What do you ask of Me, my daughter, that I do not do?"
