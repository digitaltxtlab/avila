1. Jesus be with your honors. I received your letter. It always makes me very happy to have news from you and to see how our Lord keeps you faithful to your good resolves. That is no small thing with your being in that Babylon, where you will always hear things more apt to distract the soul than to recollect it. It's true, though, that for those with good intelligence the sight of so much going on, and such a variety, will lead them to recognize the vanity and short duration of all things.
2. The events that have been going on in our order for more than a year are of a kind that would cause much grief to anyone who does not understand our Lord's designs. But in seeing that everything is for the greater purification of souls and that in the end God will favor his servants, we have no reason to grieve, but should long for the trials to increase and praise God that he has granted us the favor of suffering for justice' sake. And you both should do the same and trust in him, for when you least expect it you will see your desires fulfilled.
May His Majesty shield you with the holiness I beg of him, amen ...
