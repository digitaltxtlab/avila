For Padre Fray Mariano de San Benito, Carmelite, Madrid.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I tell you I don't know how we can be at peace, since you give me so much occasion for war. You know how distressed I was over the illness of Señor Licentiate Padilla and how the other business matters have been a cause of worry to me. It seems only right that you would have let me know about everything. For the love of our Lord, don't be so lacking in compassion. And tell me also how things in Andalusia are going and of Padre Fray Buenaventura, about whom I am worried.
2. You should know that our Padre Antonio ... for if Padre Fray Baltasar is not to stay there, it definitely will be necessary to send another, as everyone says. Many regards to mi padre, Señor Licentiate Padilla. Please God he is continuing to improve. Let me know how he is, whatever the case may be, and about everything else; and remember you don't have to concern yourself with what regards Malagón anymore. Doña Luisa is very happy and she gives us all the permissions we need ... and Antonio Ruiz with his frogs made me laugh.
... of October, and I am your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
