1. If our Lord hadn't granted me the favors He did, it doesn't seem to me I would have had the courage for the works that were done or the strength to support the trials suffered and the statements and judgments made against me. So after the foundations were begun, the fears I previously had in thinking I was deceived left me. I grew certain the work was God's and so I threw myself into difficult tasks, although always with advice and under obedience. As a result I understand that since our Lord desired to revive the original spirit of this order, and in His mercy He took me as a means, His Majesty had to provide me with what I was lacking, which was everything, in order to get results and better manifest His greatness through so wretched a thing.
