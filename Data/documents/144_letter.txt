For mi padre, Doctor Fray Mariano de San Benito.
1. Jesus be with your reverence. Today the good Valdemoro was here, and I believe he is telling the truth when he speaks about our being friends, for that is what suits his purposes at present. He speaks to me a lot about St. Paul's persecution of the Christians and of what he did afterward. Were he to do for God one tenth of what St. Paul did we would forgive him for both the past and the future. He tells me he is going to ask you to accept his brother.
2. Certainly, if what he says is true, and in view of your need for preachers, it would be to your advantage to have him. But I fear that since our padre in his visitations sends away those who come from other orders, he would not hear of admitting this person into his own order. What I can do in exchange for the friendship is pray for him. You can judge up there what would be the most fitting thing to do.
3. We are praying hard for the sanctification of those lords. May God bring this about according to whatever need he sees. I am worried about the trials of our good Padre Padilla. The devil will not give up waging war against works as great as those he's doing. May God grant him fortitude and health, and may he make you and Padre Maestro very holy.
4. I haven't learned anything new about the business affairs. I think you would learn about them there first. Tomorrow I will be giving Valdemoro, who is going to Madrid, a letter addressed to you. If in it I make a request in favor of his brother, my ultimate desire is that you do what renders the most service to God.
These little friars are like saints. Seeing souls like this is a great consolation, and gives one strength to suffer the trials that could come upon us.
It is 3 November.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
