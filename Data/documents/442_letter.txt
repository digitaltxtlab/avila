1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your most illustrious lordship. I shared so much in your joy that I have wanted to let you know about it, for certainly my happiness has been great. May it please our Lord to make it complete by helping my lady the duchess at the time when she gives birth, and may he preserve you in good health for many years.
2. I kiss the hands of her excellency many times, and I beg her not to fear but to have much confidence, for our Lord who has begun to grant us a favor will bring everything to completion. The Sisters and I will take very special care to beg His Majesty for this intention.
3. The trials and poor health I have had since I last wrote and the fact that I have received news about your health through other means were the reasons for my seeming to be neglectful. Yet truly I have not been neglectful of you in my poor prayers but very mindful -- whatever be their worth -- and will be so always. And I have keenly felt your illnesses. Please God they have gone away, and may he watch over you for many years.
From Burgos, 18 April,
Your most illustrious lordship's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
