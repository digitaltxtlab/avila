1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. This is a letter Señor Ahumada wrote me. I am sending it to you that you may see what he is here asking of you and not fail to do it in time. And, lest you forget because of your present grief, tell Señora Magdalena at once, so that she may take care of the matter. It would be a regrettable thing to rent the house when not needed, or to give it up when needed. Give her my best wishes, and tell her also to let me know how she is doing.
2. It seems to me that our Lord wanted to bring that little angel to be with her mother in heaven. May he be blessed for everything, for as I've been told, the poor little one was always sick. God has granted a great favor to us all, and to you especially by giving you so many people up there to help you bear the trials of this life. May it please His Majesty to watch over Doña Catalina, and may he always guide you by the hand, amen.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
