1. Jesus be with your honor. Yesterday evening I received a letter from our Padre Gracián in which he tells me that the papal bulls for the Archbishop of Toledo have arrived. He believes the archbishop is already in Toledo, and that if he is there, he will be there in order to take possession of his see. Just now I have found this man, which I consider most fortunate. He says he will deliver the letter on Tuesday by noon. Today is Sunday, 19 October, I believe.
2. Since it is now so late into the night, I am saying no more, nor did I let my brother know about this messenger, for I don't believe he would have anything to ask of you. I gave the messenger three reales and I will give him another two here. When he is there give him two for his return, for we agreed on seven. I have some scruple about paying him everything here until I ask advice. Oh, what a trial these restraints of our poverty are! May it please the Lord -- since I can't do anything -- to provide for you in some other way, as he can.
3. I will have my letter ready so that you will not have to delay here, for it will be important for you to find the archbishop in Toledo. Yesterday I wrote again to Señora Doña Luisa that she not forget and to the prioress to keep reminding her. God willing, all these efforts and favors should be enough. Choose an animal that travels well and not some poor beast that's going to wear you out.
4. The nuns are without Mass, and there is nothing new, not even with regard to the other business matters, although they are proceeding well. Tell the prioress about this messenger in case she may want to write to me.
5. My sister may consider this as written for her too, and give my regards to Beatriz. Had we been seers, you could have left in time for Toledo by leaving from here, although the season is still good for travel. May the Lord take care of things, and since it's so late I'll say no more.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
