	To the very magnificent Señor Maldonado Bocalán, my lord.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, and may he repay you for your charity and care in sending us the donation given by Señor Don Francisco. May it please our Lord to preserve you for many years and further the improvement that you are beginning to experience.
2. For not knowing where to address my letter, I did not ask you to send me the poultry. The indigence of this house is so great and there are so many sick nuns that we really needed it. I, too, have been very sick, although I am better now. The donation that we have again received was most consoling to me. May God be blessed for everything. The one who brought the poultry performed his task very well.
3. So I affirm that I received today, on the eve of Our Lady of the Purification in the year 1573, sixty-two birds, and in confirmation of this, I sign my name. May the Lord always lead your honor by the hand, and may His Majesty give you as many blessings as possible, amen.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus, prioress
I have already written to Señor Don Francisco about the care you have for us and the good condition in which the poultry arrived.
