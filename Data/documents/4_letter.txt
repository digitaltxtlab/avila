1. This day, Quasimodo Sunday, 1564, Juan de San Cristóbal and Teresa of Jesus entered into agreement on the sale of a group of dovecotes for 100 ducats free of tithes or duties.
2. The amount will be paid in this manner: 10,000 maravedis now and 10,000 by Pentecost Sunday; the remainder will be paid by St. John's feast of this year.
In confirmation of the above, I place my signature.
Teresa of Jesus
