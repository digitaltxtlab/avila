Take courage, the order of the Blessed Virgin will flourish
 
1. One day the Lord told me: "You always desire trials, and on the other hand you refuse them. I dispose things in conformity with what I know is your will and not in conformity with your sensual nature and weakness. Take courage, since you see how I help you. I have desired that you win this crown. In your days you will see the order of the Blessed Virgin flourish."
2. I heard this from the Lord in the middle of February, 1571.
