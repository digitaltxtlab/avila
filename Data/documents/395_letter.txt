For Mother Prioress of the Carmel of St. Joseph, Seville.
1. For goodness' sake do not rely much on that extra weight and take care of yourself. I recommend that Madre Juana de la Cruz watch that you do this, and Mother Subprioress, and San Francisco; and they should let me know if you don't.
2. Father Provincial has now given me again the authorization to do certain things. By that authority I command you to do what is necessary for the good of your health and whatever my dear Juana de la Cruz tells you to do, and both of you should report to me on how you are doing. Otherwise, for your penance I will not write to you.
3. For the time being we don't want your penances but that you do not give them to others with your illnesses and that you be obedient to me and not kill me. Truthfully I tell you I would not feel the loss of any prioress as much as I would losing you. I don't know how it is that I love you so much.
