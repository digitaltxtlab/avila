29. For a Profession
 
All who serve in the army
Beneath this banner,
Sleep no longer, sleep no more,
For now there is no earthly peace.
 
As the captain strong
Our God wished to die,
Let us follow Him now
For we caused His death.
Oh what a happy lot
He won from this strife!
Sleep no longer, sleep no more,
For God is wanting from the earth.
 
With contentment great
On the cross He longs to die
His light to give us all
In His sufferings severe.
Oh victory so glorious!
Oh fortunate this war!
Sleep no longer, sleep no more,
For God is wanting from the earth.
 
Not one coward will there be!
Let us risk our lives!
None better guards it
Than he who loses it.
Our guide is Jesus,
The reward of this warring.
Sleep no longer, sleep no more,
For there is no peace on earth.
 
Let us truly offer ourselves
All to die for Christ,
In the wedding in heaven
Joyful we will be.
Follow these banners
Christ leads us on.
Fear nothing, do not sleep,
For there is no peace on earth.
