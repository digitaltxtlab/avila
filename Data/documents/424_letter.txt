1. ... left without one or the other, as you say. Renting it will not do, because they are forced to buy a house as soon as possible, be it good or bad. And I don't know why it is that I cannot feel disappointed that they couldn't come to an agreement over the Monroy house, for it seems to me they would die if they stayed there. Not all the monasteries are in places where the nuns would have wanted to be, but only where they could be. Anyway, you will see what is best. I don't know how you can say that you will come with my sister, or how you could find time for that.
2. This enclosed letter written to me by Francisco's mother-in-law came two days ago, and it annoyed me very much to see such bad motives. The learned men from around here say that the will can not be annulled without one's sinning mortally. I believe I will find it necessary not to allow this child to be separated from me; and so they will be unable to do anything about this, nor would we permit it. That she be left to go free is what I fear. She is now sick with a bad cold and a fever. I very much recommend her as well as all the nuns to your prayers.
3. Remain with God, for it just struck twelve o'clock. Either inform them about what has to be done so that they can make the trip, or let me know.
Anne of St. Bartholomew does not stop writing; she helps me very much. She kisses your reverence's hands.
You should know that I don't have anyone to go with me to Burgos, so don't think of abandoning me.
Today is 4 December.
