1. Having spoken one day to a person who had given up a great deal for God and recalling how I had never given up anything for Him -- nor have I ever served Him in accordance with my obligation -- and considering the many favors he had bestowed on my soul, I began to grow very anxious. And the Lord said: "You already know of the espousal between you and Me. Because of this espousal, whatever I have is yours. So I give you all the trials and sufferings I underwent, and by these means, as with something belonging to you, you can make requests of my Father." Although I had heard we share these, now I had heard it in such a different way that it seemed I felt great dominion. The friendship in which this favor was granted me cannot be described here. It seemed to me the Father accepted the fact of this sharing; and since then I look very differently upon what the Lord suffered, as something belonging to me -- and it gives me great comfort.
