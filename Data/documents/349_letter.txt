1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and give you the spiritual and bodily strength to bear the terrible blow that this trial has been. If it hadn't come from a hand so compassionate and just, I wouldn't know how to console you, so great is my own grief. But since I know how truly this sovereign God loves us and that you have understood well the wretchedness and instability of this miserable life, I hope in His Majesty that he will give you more and more light to understand the favor our Lord grants to those he removes from it once they have come to know him. You can be especially certain, in accord with our faith, that this holy soul is where he will receive the reward that accords with the many trials he endured in this life and bore with so much patience.
2. I have very earnestly begged our Lord for this and asked these sisters to do so as well. And I have asked him to give you consolation and health so that you may again take up the struggle of life in this miserable world. Blessed are those who are already in safety. I don't think this is the time to go on at length, unless with our Lord in begging him to console you, for creatures are of little help in a grief like this, especially as deplorable a creature as myself.
3. May His Majesty show you his power and from here on be your companion in such a way that you will not miss the good one you have lost.
Today is the vigil of the Transfiguration.
Your honor's unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus
