1. O
nce while thinking about the severe penance Doña Catalina de Cordona performed and about how because of the desires for penance the Lord sometimes gives me I could have done more were it not for obedience to my confessors, I thought it might be better not to obey them any longer in this matter. The Lord told me: "That's not so; you are walking on a good and safe path. Do you see all the penance she does? I value your obedience more."
