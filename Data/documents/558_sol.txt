1. O my Hope, my Father, my Creator, and my true Lord and Brother! When I consider how You say that Your delights are with the children of the earth, my soul rejoices greatly. O Lord of heaven and earth, what words these are that no sinner might be wanting in trust! Are You, Lord, perhaps lacking someone with whom to delight that You seek such a foul-smelling little worm like myself? That voice that was heard at the Baptism says You delight in Your Son. Well, will we all be equal, Lord? Oh, what extraordinary mercy and what favor so beyond our ability to deserve! And that mortals forget all of this! Be mindful, my God, of so much misery, and behold our weakness, since you are the Knower of everything.
2. O my soul: Consider the great delight and great love the Father has in knowing His Son and the Son in knowing His Father; and the enkindling love with which the Holy Spirit is joined with them; and how no one of them is able to be separate from this love and knowledge, because they are one. These sovereign Persons know each other, love each other, and delight in each other. Well, what need is there for my love? Why do You want it, my God, or what do You gain? Oh, may You be blessed! May You be blessed, my God, forever! May all things praise You, Lord, without end since in You there can be no end.
3. Be joyful, my soul, for there is someone who loves your God as He deserves. Be joyful, for there is someone who knows His goodness and value. Give thanks to Him, for He has given us on earth someone who thus knows Him, as His only Son. Under this protection you can approach and petition Him, for then His Majesty takes delight in you. Don't let any earthly thing be enough to separate you from your delight, and rejoice in the grandeur of God; in how He deserves to be loved and praised; that He helps you to play some small role in the blessing of His name; and that you can truthfully say: My soul magnifies and praises the Lord.
