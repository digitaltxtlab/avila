1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I received your letter and those of José Bullón. May our Lord watch over him, for it is hard to have to see him go so far, but since the need is great something has to be suffered. We all owe him much; he has the virtue and talents for this, and even more. May God bring him back safely. I beg you to let me know on what day and in what manner he left.
2. I can't wait for him to leave our country, seeing that he is traveling in such a manner. May no misfortune befall us; we would find ourselves in a terrible situation.
3. May our Lord reward you for the good news you sent me. You should know that ever since those lords and those Dominican fathers of mine were appointed assessors to the nuncio, all my worries about our affairs left me. For I know them and with persons like the four of them, I am certain that what they ordain will be for God's honor and glory, which is what we are all seeking.
4. The ones whom I'm now very worried about are the fathers of the mitigation, for such ugly events cannot but deeply hurt those who wear this habit. May God provide a remedy, watch over you, and repay you for the goodwill you have shown toward this order and your good deeds, which certainly cause me to praise God. Where charity is present, His Majesty provides ways for exercising it.
5. May it please him to watch over your honor and Señora Doña María. Although miserable, I do not neglect to beg him for this and that he make you both very holy.
Today is 2 May.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
