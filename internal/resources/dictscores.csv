"2",1560,1,"1. It is a little more or less than nine months ago that I wrote the above, which is in my own handwriting. Since then, not turning back from the favors God granted me, it seems to me I have received again, insofar as I understand, much greater freedom. Up until now, I thought I needed others, and I had more trust in help from the world. Now I understand clearly that all this help is like little sticks of dry rosemary and that in being attached to it there is no security; for when some weight of contradiction or criticism comes along, these little sticks break. So I have experience that the true remedy against a fall is to be attached to the cross and trust in Him who placed Himself upon it. I discover that He is the true friend, and through this friendship I find in myself a dominion by which it seems to me I could resist, providing God doesn't fail me, anyone who might be against me.
2. Though now I understand this truth so clearly, I used to be very fond of being liked. No longer does being liked matter to me; rather, it seems in part to weary me, except in the case of those with whom I discuss my soul or whom I am thinking of helping. For I desire that the former like me so they might bear with me and that the latter do so that they might be more inclined to believe what I tell them about the vanity of everything.
3. In the very severe trials and persecutions and opposition I experienced these past months, God has given me great courage; and the greater these trials were the greater was the courage, without my growing tired of suffering. Toward persons who spoke evil of me, not only did I feel I bore no harsh feelings but it seemed to me I gained new love for them. I don't know how this came about; it was a blessing given by the hand of the Lord.
4. It is usually my nature that when I desire something I am impulsive in my desire for it. Now, my desires bear with them such quiet that when I see them fulfilled I don't even know if I rejoice. Sorrow and rejoicing, except in matters of prayer, are completely softened in intensity; for I seem like a fool and go around like one for some days.
5. The impulses to do penance that come upon",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,8,0,10,23,0,3,3,17,3,8,17,8,1,2,6,1,2,1,1
"3",1560,2,"me sometimes and have come upon me, are great. And if I do penance, I feel it so little on account of that strong desire that sometimes it seems to me -- or almost always -- that penance is a special favor; although I don't do much since I am very sickly.
6. It is the greatest pain for me sometimes, and now more extreme, to have to go to eat, especially when I'm in prayer. This pain must be great because it makes me weep a good deal and utter words of distress, almost without being aware of it, which I usually do not do. However great the trials I have experienced in this life, I don't recall having said these words. I am not at all like a woman in such matters, for I have a robust spirit.
7. I feel in me the greatest desire, more than usual, that God have persons, especially learned men, who serve Him with complete detachment and who are held back by nothing here below; because I see it is all a mockery. Since I'm aware of the great needs of the Church -- for these afflict me so much that it seems to me silly to feel sorrow about anything else -- I don't do anything but pray to God for these persons. For I see that one person who is completely perfect would do more good with a true, fervent love of God than many others would with lukewarmness.
8. In matters of faith, I find, in my opinion, that I have much greater fortitude. It seems to me I would stand up alone against all Lutherans in order to make them understand their error. I greatly grieve over the perdition of so many souls. I see many souls that are advanced, for I know clearly God has desired their progress by means of me. And I recognize that through His goodness my soul increases each day in loving Him more.
9. It seems to me that even were I to try to experience vainglory I wouldn't be able to, nor do I see how I could think that any of these virtues are mine. It wasn't long ago that for many years I saw myself without any. And now for my part I don't do anything but receive favors, without serving, but as the most useless thing in the world. So it is that I sometimes reflect how all are advancing but me, that I am not worth anything. Certainly this",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,15,1,9,20,1,1,5,18,8,11,21,12,5,1,3,0,4,1,1
"4",1560,3,"is not humility but truth. And knowing I am so useless, I sometimes become fearful in thinking I may be deceived. So I see clearly that from these revelations and raptures -- for I play no part in them nor do I do anything more to receive them than be a blank tablet -- there come to me these benefits. This gives me assurance and makes me more calm. I place myself in the arms of God, and I trust in my desires. For these desires, certainly, I understand are to die for Him and lose all repose, come what may.
10. There come days in which I recall an infinite number of times what St. Paul says -- although assuredly not present in me to the degree it was in him -- for it seems to me I neither live, nor speak, nor have any desire but that He who strengthens and governs me might live in me. I go about as though outside myself, and so life is the severest pain for me. And the greatest thing I offer God as a principal service to Him is that, since it is so painful for me to live separated from Him, I desire to live, but out of love for Him. I should like to live with great trials and persecutions. Since I am no good for being of any help to anyone, I should like to be good for suffering so that all who are in the world might receive a little more merit, I mean by a better fulfillment of His will.
11. I haven't experienced any promise in prayer that I haven't seen fulfilled, even though the promise may have come many years previously. There are so many things I see and understand about the grandeurs of God, and of His providence, that almost any time I begin to think about it my intellect fails me, as when one sees things that are far beyond one's ability to understand; and I remain in recollection.
12. God so guards me against offending Him that I am certainly sometimes amazed. For I think I see the great care He takes of me, without my doing hardly anything. I was a sea of sins and iniquities before receiving these favors, and it seemed I was not master of myself in such a way that I could avoid them. The reason I would like this known is that one might have knowledge of the great power of God. May He be",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,7,1,12,28,2,1,4,17,4,8,20,8,5,2,0,1,4,1,0
"6",1561,1,"For Madre Ana de San Alberto.
1. Jesus be with your reverence, my daughter. It was most consoling to know that the house is so cool and that you will not have to suffer as you did a year ago. It would be a real delight for me, if it pleased God, to spend some days down there with you. I would have fewer letters and business matters to attend to and be near the little ducks and the water, which must make you feel like hermits. I don't deserve this, but I am very happy that you can enjoy it for me.
2. You should know that I never thought I loved you so much, for I have a great desire to see you. Perhaps God will so ordain. I pray very much for you and have the satisfaction of knowing that he will assist you in everything. I have no worries about your helping those souls to attain a high perfection. But you must realize you cannot treat all the nuns alike. That sister to whom our padre gave the habit should be treated like someone who is sick; no demands should be made of her that require much perfection. It's enough that she does the best she can, as they say, and avoids offending God.
3. There is much to suffer everywhere, especially when beginning, for until a house is established we take in all the nuns we can, if they have the money, so as to supply for the needs of the others. Especially in this case it was right to take her for she contributed to the start of the foundation. Bear with her, my daughter, as best you can. If her soul is in a good state, consider how she is a dwelling place of God.
4. I praise him every time he sends some joy to our padre. So that you will do this, I tell you that our padre said you were one of the best prioresses. Since you are so alone, His Majesty helps you. Regarding the money you owe Malagón, don't worry about it. It's enough that you send it when you can.
5. Our padre is well, glory to God. But he has many trials, for, as you know, the nuncio died and Tostado, who is the vicar general sent by our Most Reverend Padre, is in Madrid. Although the king until now has not wanted him to carry on any visitations, we don't know how things will end up.

"7",1561,2,"commission has not ended even though the nuncio is dead, and so he is still visitator. I believe he is in Pastrana now. Much prayer is necessary so that what is for the greater service of God will be done. We are praying much here and have held processions. Don't neglect to do this, for the need is now great, although it appears that everything will turn out all right.
7. Despite all his troubles our padre has not failed to attend to the affairs of your house and has spoken twice with the bishop, who received him very graciously. He said he would do all that was required and he wrote himself to that lady. He sent me a letter here last week, but he was waiting for I don't know what. Our padre is very happy and he says that everything will be done well. Don't worry if there is a little delay, for I assure you things were done with great care. The income has been satisfactory. Don't be disturbed, for everything will be done promptly.
8. If you are happy with the postulants -- I mean, the elderly woman's daughters -- you don't have to do anything else than admit them to profession, even though they may have some infirmities, for there is no woman without them. The problem with my head is a little better, although I cannot write myself. I don't write to any monastery except through a secretary, unless in regard to something special, and thus I will finish this one myself.
9. What shall I say of the commotion caused by our illnesses, especially in Seville. The enclosed letter will inform you about them. I am sorry about Encarnación, although those are infirmities that diminish as one grows older. Give her and everyone else my best regards, especially the subprioress and the foundresses.
10. The presider in Malagón is Ana de la Madre de Dios. She is a very good religious and carries out her office well without deviating one iota from the Constitutions. In Seville they have many trials. The subprioress has been anointed, and the prioress has a continuing fever. So this is not the time to ask them for something. Remember that they bore the cost of your expenses from Seville. They are going to receive some postulants and they will pay you.

"9",1562,1,"To the Very Magnificent and Reverend Señor Gaspar de Salazar, rector of the house of the Society of Jesus in Cuenca. My lord and my Father.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor always, amen. I am delighted that the occasion has arisen in which I can send you news of myself, since you are so neglectful in sending me news about yourself. May it please our Lord that you enjoy the health I beg of him for you.
2. Many days and even months had gone by without my having received a letter from you filled with good counsel and advice. Your letter came just at the right time, for I was greatly encouraged, although your prayers must have brought me even greater benefit. I want you to know that in this house the Lord has bestowed so many favors that I can assure you I no longer have any more reason to be distressed over resistance to obedience and recollection here than at St. Joseph's. It seems the Lord is giving these souls so many graces altogether that I am stupefied. So was Father Visitator who found nothing to correct in the visitation he made a month ago. Would you give thanks to the Lord for that. In the monastery of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, he appointed discalced friars as prior, subprior, porter, and sacristan. And one of them, who is very saintly, has been the confessor here for some time. He has done much good; and all of them are to my liking.
3. This decision has been an exceptionally good one. If this house were entrusted completely to them -- as I hope in the Lord it will be -- there would be no need for me to stay here any longer. Pray for this, that a proper remedy will be found for everything. Up to the present I have had many trials and duties, and in the winter poor health, for this house aggravates my illnesses. I consider it all worthwhile when I see the favors that His Majesty has granted me. I had a strong desire that you might know about these things, and if I could see you it would be a great consolation to me. (Pass on to the next page, for I got a bad piece of paper.) May the Lord do his will in all things.

2. I am now going to send your letter to Father Vicar. I am writing myself to his paternity listing the advantages or reasons there seem to be for him to give the permission; and I am telling him why Ana de Jesús was not accepted there. Understand that I am always fearful of much money, although the things they tell me about this young woman make me think that God is drawing her. Please God, this will be for his service, amen. Give her my best regards and tell her I am happy that I will be able to see her so soon. The illness of Doña María has grieved me very much. May God give her health, which is what I am begging of him, for I certainly see how much I care for her now that I am without her.
3. You must know that on the feast of Corpus Christi our Father Vicar sent me a command to go to your house. There were many censures in the bishop's orders lest the vicar would resist carrying out well what the bishop wanted him to do. So, I suppose I will be leaving here a day or two after the feast of St. John.
4. In your charity, forward to me in Medina a letter that our Father Vicar will send you, for it is necessary that I see it there. And tell them not to prepare for my arrival with any noisy reception, and I ask the same of you, for I tell you definitely that such receptions mortify me instead of making me happy. This is really true, for within myself I become upset to see how little I deserve all the attention; and the bigger the fuss, the more upset I become. See that they don't do anything special if they don't want to greatly mortify me.
5. Regarding the other things you wrote about, I am not going to say anything because, with God's favor, I will be seeing you soon. I'll stop off in Medina no more than three or four days, since I'll be returning there on my way to Salamanca. This is in accord with the orders of Father Vicar; and he does not want me to stay long in Valladolid.

"14",1566,1,"Prologue
 
JHS
 
1. The Sisters in this monastery of St. Joseph have known that I received permission from the Father Presentado, Friar Domingo Báñez, of the order of the glorious St. Dominic, who at present is my confessor, to write some things about prayer. It seems I might be able to meet with success in doing this because I have discussed prayer with many spiritual and holy persons. The Sisters have urged me so persistently to tell them something about it that I have decided to obey them. I am aware that the great love they have for me will make what I say, so imperfectly and with such poor style, more acceptable than what is in some books that are very well written by those who know what they are writing about. And I trust in the Sisters' prayers that possibly through them the Lord will be pleased that I manage to say something about the mode and manner of life proper to this house. And if I should be mistaken, the Father Presentado, who will be the first to see this book, will either make corrections or burn it. I will not have lost anything by obeying these servants of God, and they will see what I have when left to myself and when His Majesty doesn't help me.
2. I am thinking of listing some remedies for certain common, small temptations of the devil, for since they are so common perhaps little attention is paid to them. And I shall write of other things as the Lord inspires me or that might come to my mind; for since I don't know what I'm going to say, I cannot say it in an orderly way. I believe this lack of order is best since writing this book is a thing already so out of order for me. May the Lord have a hand in all that I do so that it may conform to His holy will; these are my desires always, even though my works are as faulty as I am.
3. I know there is no lack of love in me and of the desire to help as much as I can that the souls of my Sisters may advance in the service of the Lord. This love together with my age and the experience I have from living in some monasteries may help me in speaking of ordinary things to be more successful than learned men. Since these learned men have other more important occupations",3,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,11,3,1,2,16,0,4,15,0,0,1,15,9,7,19,4,2,5,1,1,2,3,0
"15",1566,2,"and are strong, they don't pay so much attention to things that don't seem to amount to much in themselves. But everything can be harmful to those as weak as we women are. The wiles of the devil are many for women who live a very cloistered life, for the devil sees that new weapons are needed in order to do harm. I, as wretched as I am, have known how to defend myself only poorly. So I have desired that my Sisters might take warning from my own experience. I shall say nothing about what I have not experienced myself or seen in others [or received understanding of from our Lord in prayer.]
4. Not long ago I was ordered to write a certain account of my life, in which I also dealt with some things about prayer. It could be that my confessor would not want you to see this account, and so I shall put down here something of what was said there. I shall also write of other things that to me seem necessary. May the Lord's own hand be in this work, as I have begged Him; and may He direct the work to His glory, amen. CHAPTER 4
 
Urges the observance of the rule and discusses three things that are important for the spiritual life. Explains the first of these, which is love of neighbor, and how particular friendships do harm.
 
1. Now, daughters, you have seen the great task we have undertaken [for the prelate and bishop who is your superior and for the order, already included in what was mentioned, since all is for the good of the Church; and to pray for the Church is an obligation]. What do you think we must be like if we are not to be considered very bold by God and the world? Clearly, we must work hard, and it helps a great deal to have lofty thoughts so that we will exert ourselves and make our deeds comply with our thoughts. For if we strive to observe our rule and constitutions very carefully, I hope in the Lord that our prayers will be heard. I am not beseeching you to do something new, my daughters, but only that we observe what we profess; to observe this is our vocation and obligation -- although there are many degrees of observance.
2. Our primitive rule states that we must pray without ceasing. If we do this with all the care possible -- for unceasing prayer is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,4,18,0,7,16,0,1,0,11,5,12,15,9,4,3,2,1,4,1,0
"16",1566,3,"the most important aspect of the rule -- the fasts, the disciplines, and the silence the order commands will not be wanting. For you already know that if prayer is to be genuine, it must be helped by these other things; prayer and comfortable living are incompatible.
3. It is about prayer that you asked me to say something, and I beg you that in recompense for what I am going to say you eagerly do what I have said up until now, and read it often. Before I say anything about interior matters, that is, about prayer, I shall mention some things that are necessary for those who seek to follow the way of prayer; so necessary that even if these persons are not very contemplative, they can be far advanced in the service of the Lord if they possess these things. And if they do not possess them, it is impossible for them to be very contemplative. And if they think they are, they are being highly deceived. May the Lord help me speak of these things, and may he teach me what I am about to say so that it may be for His glory, amen.
4. Do not think, my friends and daughters, that I shall burden you with many things; please God, we shall do what our holy fathers established and observed, for by walking this path they themselves established they merited this title we give them. It would be wrong to seek another way or try to learn about this path from anyone else. I shall enlarge on only three things, which are from our own constitutions, for it is very important that we understand how much the practice of these three things helps us to possess inwardly and outwardly the peace our Lord recommended so highly to us. The first of these is love for one another; the second is detachment from all created things; the third is true humility, which, even though I speak of it last, is the main practice and embraces all the others.
5. About the first, love for one another, it is most important that we have this, for there is nothing annoying that is not suffered easily by those who love one another -- a thing would have to be extremely annoying before causing any displeasure. And if this commandment were observed in the world as it should be, I think such love would be very helpful for the observance of the other commandments. But, because of either",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,0,11,0,5,19,0,2,1,8,4,13,18,7,0,8,0,0,1,4,0
"17",1566,4,"excess or defect, we never reach the point of observing this commandment perfectly.
It may seem that having excessive love among ourselves could not be evil, but such excess carries with it so much evil and so many imperfections that I don't think anyone will believe this save the one who has been an eyewitness. The devil lays many snares here, for this excess is hardly noticed by persons having consciences that deal only roughly with pleasing God, and the excess even seems to them virtuous; but those who are interested in perfection have a deep understanding of this excessive love, because little by little it takes away the strength of will to be totally occupied in loving God.
6. I believe this excessive love must be found among women even more than among men; and the harm it does in the community is well known. It gives rise to the following: failing to love equally all the others; feeling sorry about any affront to the friend; desiring possessions so as to give her gifts; looking for time to speak with her, and often so as to tell her that you hold her dear and other trifling things rather than about your love for God. For these great friendships are seldom directed toward helping one love God more. On the contrary, I think the devil gets them started so as to promote factions in religious orders. For when love is in the service of His Majesty, the will does not proceed with passion but proceeds by seeking help to conquer other passions.
7. I should like that there be many of these friendships where there is a large community, but in this house where there are no more than thirteen -- nor must there be any more -- all must be friends, all must be loved, all must be held dear, all must be helped. Watch out for these friendships, for love of the Lord, however holy they may be; even among brothers they can be poisonous. I see no benefit in them. And if the friends are relatives, the situation in much worse -- it's a pestilence! And believe me, daughters, even though this kind of talk seems extreme, great perfection and great peace lie in keeping my advice; and many occasions are removed from those who are not strong. But if the will should be inclined to one more than to another (this cannot be helped, for it is natural and we are often drawn to love the worst",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,9,0,11,38,0,3,1,13,1,13,14,16,4,1,2,1,1,12,0
"18",1566,5,"one if that person is endowed with more natural graces), let us be careful not to allow ourselves to be dominated by that affection. Let us love the virtues and interior good, and always studiously avoid paying attention to this exterior element.
8. Let us not condescend, oh daughters, to allow our wills to be slaves to anyone, save to the One who bought it with His blood. Be aware that, without understanding how, you will find yourselves so attached that you will be unable to manage the attachment. Oh, God help me, the silly things that come from such attachment are too numerous to be counted. And because these things are so minute that only the one who sees such friendship will understand and believe what is said about them, there's no reason to say any more here -- except that such a friendship is bad when found in anyone; but when found in the prioress it's a pestilence.
9. To break away from these friendships involving a particular fondness, great care is necessary at the outset of the friendship. This breaking away should be done delicately and lovingly rather than harshly. In providing a remedy it is important that the friends avoid being together and speaking to each other save at the designated hours. This would be in conformity with the custom we now follow, which is that we are not to be together but each one alone in her own cell, as the rule commands. At St. Joseph's the nuns should be excused from having a common workroom, for although having one is a laudable custom, silence is better observed when each nun is by herself; and to get used to solitude is a great help for prayer. Since prayer must be the foundation of this house, it is necessary that we strive to dedicate ourselves to what most helps us in prayer.
10. Returning to the subject of our loving one another, it seems pointless to be recommending this love. For are there persons who can be so like brutes that they will not love each other even though they must always deal with and be in the company of one another and have no dealings and no recreation with persons outside the house and believe that God loves them and they Him, since for His sake they have left everything? I say this especially since virtue always inspires love, and I hope in His Majesty that those living in this house will with the help of",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,1,3,2,7,0,5,34,2,1,1,12,10,8,7,8,1,5,0,1,1,5,0
"19",1566,6,"God always be virtuous. So, in my opinion, I don't have to recommend this love a great deal.
11. What I would like to say a little about now is how this love for one another must be practiced. I would like to speak also of the nature of this virtuous love -- which is the love I want practiced here -- and how we know if we have this love; for our Lord recommended it so highly and so urgently to His apostles. What I say will be in conformity with my dullness of mind; and if in other books you find a detailed explanation don't take anything from me, for perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about.
12. Two kinds of love are what I'm dealing with: One kind is spiritual, because it in no way seems to stir sensuality or affect the tenderness of our nature so as to take away purity. The other is spiritual mixed with our sensuality and weakness or good love, for it seems to be licit, as is love for our relatives and friends. I have already said something about it.
13. I want to speak now about the love that is spiritual, that which is not affected by any passion; where passion is present the good order is thrown into complete disorder. And if we deal with virtuous persons discreetly and moderately, especially confessors, we will benefit. But if you should become aware that the confessor is turning toward some vanity, be suspicious about everything and in no way carry on conversations with him even though they may seem to be good, but make your confession briefly and bring it to a conclusion. And it would be best to tell the prioress that your soul doesn't get on well with him and change confessors. That would be the most proper thing to do -- if you can do it without hurting his reputation.
14. In similar cases and others as well, in which the devil could ensnare one in many difficulties and in which one does not know what counsel to take, the best thing to do is try to speak with some learned person; when necessary there should be the freedom to do this. Make your confession to him and do what he tells you to do about the matter; for since one must provide some remedy, one could fall into great error. How many mistakes have been made in the world by doing things without counsel, especially in matters that",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,12,0,8,29,1,0,2,18,11,18,20,6,0,6,0,0,2,11,0
"20",1566,7,"could be harmful to someone! Failing to provide a remedy cannot be allowed; for unless the devil is quickly cut short, the effect will not be something of minor importance when he begins to interfere. Thus what I have said about trying to speak with another confessor is what is best to do, provided that there be an opportunity; and I hope in the Lord there will be.
15. Keep in mind that this is a very important point, for such friendship is dangerous, harmful, and a hell for all the Sisters. I say that you must not wait until you recognize that serious evil is present, but you should in the beginning cut the relationship short by every possible and knowable means. In good conscience you can do so. But I hope in the Lord that He will not permit that persons who must always be engaged in prayer will be able to love anyone who is not the Lord's great servant. That they ought not is very certain -- or else they have neither the prayer nor the perfection that is in conformity with our goal here. For if they see that a person doesn't understand their language and doesn't love to speak of God, they will not be able to love him, because he will not be like them. If he is like them, since the opportunities for these servants of God to engage in such friendship are so few, he will not want to disturb them; or he will be a simpleton.
16. Now I have begun to speak about this matter because, as I have said, the harm the devil can here cause is great, and only very slowly is it recognized; thus perfection can be gradually vitiated without one's knowing why. For if this confessor wants to allow room for vanity, because he himself is vain, he makes little of it even in others. May God, because of who He is, deliver us from such things. A situation like this would be enough to disturb all the nuns because their consciences tell them the opposite of what their confessor does. And if they are restricted to only one confessor, they don't know what to do or how to be at peace. For the one who should be calming them and providing a remedy is the one who is causing the harm. There must be a lot of these kinds of affliction in some places. It makes me feel great pity, and so you shouldn't",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,1,0,16,0,18,26,2,5,2,13,18,17,16,10,1,6,1,0,0,3,0
"21",1566,8,"be surprised if I have tried to explain this danger to you.

CHAPTER 5
 
Continues on the subject of confessors. Speaks of the importance of their being learned.
 
1. May the Lord, because of who He is, not allow anyone in this house to undergo the trial that has been mentioned; that is, to find oneself in this affliction of body and soul. Nor may He allow a situation in which if the prioress gets along well with the confessor no one dares to speak either to him about her or to her about him. The result of this state of affairs will be the temptation to omit the confession of very serious sins for fear of being disturbed. O God help me, what harm the devil can cause here, and how dearly the nuns will pay for this restriction and concern about honor! For while they think that by dealing with no more than one confessor they are doing something great for religious life and the reputation of the monastery, the devil manages in this way to catch souls, since he cannot in any other. If they ask to go to another confessor, it immediately seems as if the peace and harmony of religious life will be lost. Or if the desired confessor is not from the same order, merely speaking with him, even though he may be a saint [Jerome], is taken as an affront by the others. [Praise God very much, daughters, for this freedom that you have, since you are able here to speak to others -- though not too many others -- besides your ordinary confessors, and these will give you light about everything.]
2. I ask, for the love of the Lord, that this holy freedom be allowed by the one who is superior. May she always ask permission from the bishop or the provincial that, besides speaking with the ordinary confessors, she and all the others might sometimes speak and discuss their souls with learned persons, especially if the confessors, however good, may not be learned. Learning is a great help for shedding light upon every matter. It will be possible to find both learning and goodness in some persons. And the more the Lord favors you in prayer, the more necessary it will be that your prayer and good works have a good foundation.
3. You already know that the cornerstone must be a good conscience and that with all your strength you must strive to free yourselves even from venial sins and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,1,2,31,0,10,22,2,1,1,20,10,11,22,8,0,7,0,1,2,1,0
"22",1566,9,"seek what is the most perfect. It will seem to you that any confessor knows this, but that is misleading. It happened to me that I spoke about matters of conscience with a confessor who had gone through the whole course of theology, and he did me a great deal of harm by telling me that some matters didn't amount to anything. I know that he didn't intend to misinform me and had no reason to, but he simply didn't know any more. And the same thing happened to me with two or three others, besides the one I mentioned.
4. Having true light at our disposal for the sake of keeping the law of God with perfection is all our good; prayer is well founded on such light. Without this strong foundation and if the Sisters are not given freedom to confess and discuss their souls with persons like those I have mentioned, the whole building will be wobbly. [Thus they must speak to spiritual and learned persons. If the appointed confessor is not spiritual and learned, they should at times seek out others. And if, perhaps, they receive orders not to confess to others, they can speak outside of confession to the kind of person I mentioned.] And I dare say more, that even if the confessor has all the qualities I mentioned, it is good sometimes to consult others because it is still possible for him to be mistaken; and it is important that not all be misled by him. One should seek always that there be nothing contrary to obedience, for there are ways and means for everything. And so it is good that in all possible ways one seek such counsel that is so valuable to souls.
5. All this that I have said should be of concern to the prioress. So I beg her again that, since no other consolation is sought here than the soul's, she should seek the soul's consolation by doing what I said. For there are different paths along which God leads souls, and one confessor perhaps will not know them all. I assure you there will not be lacking holy persons who will want to speak to you about your souls and bring you comfort -- if your souls are what they should be -- even though you may be poor. He who sustains your bodies will awaken someone and give him the desire to enlighten your souls and bring a remedy to this evil that I fear. For",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,21,0,4,15,1,1,0,18,11,16,19,14,0,7,0,1,0,0,0
"23",1566,10,"even if the devil tempts a confessor so as to deceive him about some doctrine, he will be careful and consider with caution everything he does when he knows that you speak to others.
Once this entrance has been taken away from the devil, I hope in God he will not find another one in this house. So I beg the bishop, whoever he may be, for love of the Lord, to allow the Sisters this freedom and not take it away from them when the persons they consult possess learning and goodness, a fact they can easily get to know in a city as small as this.
6. I have seen and understood what I have mentioned here, and discussed it with learned and holy persons who have considered what was most suitable for this house so that there would be progress along the path of perfection. Among dangers, which are always present as long as we live, we find that this one is a lesser one. The vicar should never have a free hand to come and go, nor should the confessor have this freedom. Rather, they should be protecting the recollection and decorum of the house and its progress, both interior and exterior, and should tell the bishop when there is some fault; but neither the vicar nor the confessor should be the superior.
7. This is our practice at present -- but not merely because of my opinion. The bishop we now have, under whose obedience we are (for many reasons obedience was not given to the Order), is a person fond of religious life and holiness and is a great servant of God. (His name is Don Alvaro de Mendoza; he is of high nobility and lineage and very fond of favoring this house in every way.) He gathered persons of learning, spirituality, and experience together in order to deal with this point; and freedom was decided upon. It is only right that the superiors who follow should hold to this opinion; it was decided upon by such good persons and sought from God with many prayers for enlightenment about the best thing to do. And from what has been known up until the present, this practice certainly is the best thing. May the Lord be pleased to preserve it always since it is for His greater glory, amen.

CHAPTER 6
 
Returns to the subject already begun, that of perfect love.
 
1. I have digressed enough, but what was said is so important that anyone who understands",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,4,1,18,0,4,25,0,1,0,20,6,10,10,9,1,2,1,1,1,2,0
"24",1566,11,"it will not blame me. Let us return now to the love that it is good for us to have, that which I say is purely spiritual. I don't know if I know what I am saying. At least I don't think it's necessary to speak much about this love, because few have it. Let the one to whom the Lord has given it praise Him very much because such a person must have reached the highest perfection. Anyway, I want to say a little about this love. Doing so will perhaps be of some benefit; for when virtue is placed before our eyes, the one who desires it grows fond of it and seeks to gain it.
2. May it please God that I understand this love; and even more, that I know how to speak of it. For I don't think I know which love is spiritual, or when sensual love is mixed with spiritual love, nor do I know why I want to speak about this spiritual love. My situation is like that of one who hears others speaking in the distance but doesn't understand what they are saying. So it is that sometimes I don't think I understand what I'm saying, but the Lord wills that it be well said. If at other times what I say is nonsense, that is what is most natural to me -- not being correct in anything.
3. Now it seems to me that those whom God brings to a certain clear knowledge love very differently than do those who have not reached it. This clear knowledge is about the nature of the world, that there is another world, about the difference between the one and the other, that the one is eternal and the other a dream; or about the nature of loving the Creator and loving the creature (and this seen through experience, which is entirely different from merely thinking about it or believing it); or this knowledge comes from seeing and feeling what is gained by the one love and lost by the other, and what the Creator is and what the creature is, and from many other things that the Lord teaches to anyone who wants to be taught by Him in prayer, or whom His Majesty desires to teach.
4. It may be, Sisters, that you will think it useless for me to speak of this love and that you will say everybody already knows these things I have mentioned. May it please the Lord that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,12,0,3,24,0,1,2,20,4,8,17,10,3,14,1,1,0,11,0
"25",1566,12,"this be so, that you know them in such a way that they be important to you and impressed deep within your being. For if you have this knowledge, you will see that I do not lie in saying that whoever the Lord brings to the state of perfection has this love. The persons the Lord brings to this state are generous souls, majestic souls. They are not content with loving something as wretched as these bodies, however beautiful they may be, however attractive. Yes, it pleases them to see such bodies, and they praise the Creator; but, no, they do not stop there. I mean stop in such a way that they love these things. It would seem to them that they were loving something of no substance, loving a shadow. They would feel chagrin, and they wouldn't have the courage, without great shame, to tell God they love Him.
5. You will tell me that such perfect persons do not know how to love or repay the love others have for them -- at least, they care little about being loved. At times nature suddenly rejoices at being loved, but then when there persons return to themselves they see that this is foolish, unless the souls of the others will benefit either by doctrine or by prayer. All other affection wearies these persons, for they understand that no benefit comes from it and that it could be harmful. But this does not make these persons ungrateful or unwilling to repay the love of others by recommending them to God. They entrust to the Lord the care of those who love them, for they understand that the love comes from Him. It doesn't seem there is anything within themselves to love, and they immediately think they are loved because these others love God. They leave it to His Majesty to repay those who love them, and they beg Him to do so. In this way they remain free, for it seems to them that repaying the love is not their business. And, in fact, I think at times that if love does not come from those persons who can help us gain the blessings of the perfect, there would be great blindness in this desire to be loved.
6. Now, note well that when we desire love from some person, there is always a kind of seeking our own benefit or satisfaction, and these perfect persons have already trampled underfoot all the good things and comforts the world has",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,12,0,4,47,1,0,0,12,3,9,14,8,5,1,1,2,1,18,0
"26",1566,13,"to offer them. Their consolations are of a kind that even though they may desire them, so to speak, they cannot tolerate having them apart from God or from speaking of Him. For what benefit can come to them from being loved?
7. Since this truth is made known to them, they laugh at themselves because of the affliction they once suffered as to whether or not their love was repaid. Although our affection is good, the desire that it be repaid is very natural. But once we receive the payment, we realize that the pay is all straw; it's all air and without substance so that the wind carries it away. No matter how much we have been loved, what is there that remains for us? As a result, you shouldn't care whether you are loved or not, unless the love is for your spiritual benefit as in the case of those perfect souls I mentioned, for they realize that our nature is such that if we are not loved we soon grow weary.
It will seem to you that such persons do not love or know anyone but God. I say, yes they do love, with a much greater and more genuine love, and with passion, and with a more beneficial love; in short, it is love. And these souls are more inclined to give than to receive. Even with respect to the Creator Himself they want to give more than to receive. I say that this attitude is what merits the name ""love,"" for these other base attachments have usurped the name ""love.""
8. You will also wonder what they have affection for if they do not love because of the things they see. It is true that what they see they love and what they hear they become attached to; but the things that they see are stable. As soon as these persons love, they go beyond the bodies and turn their eyes to the soul and look to see if there is something to love in the soul. And if there isn't anything lovable, but they see some beginning and readiness so that if they love this soul and dig in this mine they will find gold, their labor causes them no pain. Nothing could be presented to them that they wouldn't eagerly do for the good of this soul, for they desire to continue loving it; but they know that if it does not love God very much and have His blessings, their loving it",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,11,0,2,40,0,0,1,9,7,13,17,5,7,5,0,2,2,20,0
"27",1566,14,"is impossible. And I say that this is impossible, no matter how much they are obligated to it; and even if it dies with love for them and does all the good works it can for them and possesses all natural graces combined, their wills will not have the strength to love it or make this love last. These persons with perfect love already have experience and know what everything is; they will not be deceived. They see that they are not at one with the other and that it is impossible for the two to continue loving each other. For it is a love that must end when they die if the other is not keeping the law of God, and these persons understand that the other does not love God and that the two must then go to their different destinies.
9. And one of these persons to whom the Lord has given true wisdom cannot esteem this love, which lasts only here on earth, for more than what it is worth, or even for less. Those who like to find their pleasure in the things of the world, in its delights, honors, and riches will attribute some value to whether the other is rich or has the means to provide for diversion and recreation. But whoever has already come to abhor all of this cares little or nothing about such things.
Well now in the case of perfect love, if a person loves there is the passion to make the other soul worthy of being loved, for, as I say, this person knows that otherwise he will not continue to love the other. It is a love that costs dearly. This person does everything he can for the other's benefit; he would lose a thousand lives that a little good might come to the other soul. O precious love that imitates the Commander-in-chief of love, Jesus, our Good! ... the other is spiritual and mixed with it our own sensuality and weakness. The important thing is that these two kinds of love are unaffected by any passion, for where passion is present the good order is thrown into complete disorder. And if we love discreetly and moderately with the love I mentioned, all will be meritorious, for what seems to us to be sensuality will be converted into virtue. But the sensuality is so intermingled with the spiritual love that at times there is no one who understands this love, especially if it is for some confessor.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,5,9,2,2,48,0,0,1,8,4,11,14,13,1,2,0,0,1,22,0
"28",1566,15,"For if persons who practice prayer see that he is holy and understands their mode of procedure, they will get to love him deeply. And here the devil batters one with scruples that disturb the soul very much, which is what the devil wants to do. If, especially, the confessor is leading the soul to higher perfection, the devil afflicts it so much that it abandons the confessor. And neither if it goes to another confessor nor again to another does the devil cease to torment it with that temptation.

What souls can do in this situation is to try not to think about whether they love the confessor or don't love him; but if they do love him, let them love him. For since we experience love for one who takes care of our bodies, shouldn't we also love one who always strives and works to care for our souls? Rather, I hold that a great principle for making much progress is to love the confessor, if he is holy and spiritual and if I see that he is diligent about my soul's progress. For our weakness is such that sometimes this love helps us very much to perform great deeds in the service of God. If the love is not of this kind, as I have said, there is danger; and the mere fact that he knows he is loved can do very serious harm, and in houses where there is a great deal of enclosure much more than in others. Because it is difficult to know which confessor is so good, there is need for much caution and prudence. The best advice is that the confessor not know that there is such affection and that no one tell him there is. But the devil so urges the soul to tell the confessor about this love that such advice becomes useless. It seems to the soul that all it has to confess is this affection and that it is obliged to confess it. For this reason I would like the Sisters to realize that this love doesn't amount to anything and pay no attention to it.

Let them take this counsel: if they know that the confessor directs all his words to the profit of their souls and they do not see or know of any other vanity (for this is soon understood by anyone who doesn't want to become a fool), and they know that he is God-fearing, they should not weary themselves over any temptation they",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,1,2,28,0,15,26,1,1,2,26,5,15,16,5,3,1,0,1,2,13,0
"29",1566,16,"may have about their great attachment; when the devil is worn out he will go away. But if they should become aware that the confessor is turning toward some vanity in what he says to them, they should be suspicious about it all and in no way carry on conversations with him even though these may concern prayer or God; but they should make their confession brief1y and bring it to a conclusion. And it would be best to tell the Mother Prioress that your soul doesn't get on well with him and change confessors. That would be the most proper thing to do, if there is the opportunity to do so, and I hope in God there will be. And you should do what you can to avoid speaking with him -- even suffer death. ... may such a building fall to the ground and kill you all the day you desire one. Moreover, I say this without remorse, and I'll beg it of God. Let her always try to speak to someone with learning; and her nuns should do so as well. May God deliver them from being ruled in everything by the confessor if he is not learned, no matter how spiritual he may seem to be or in fact is. And do not take away their freedom to confess at times with learned men and to discuss their prayer with them even though there are confessors. For many reasons I know that this is fitting and that the harm that might arise is nothing in comparison with the deception and great harm, almost without remedy, so to speak, that comes with the opposite practice. For what happens in monasteries is that good soon suffers a decline if it is not preserved with great care, and evil once it gets started is extremely difficult to get rid of because very quickly the custom becomes a habit and imperfections become natural. For as I have said, after everything was considered, grave reasons were found for deciding that this was the best course of action, that is: that the chaplain, if there be one, serve as the ordinary confessor and that when a soul feels the need, confession may be made to persons like the ones mentioned. These may be named by the bishop, or if the Mother Prioress is such that the bishop entrusts this task to her, she may name them on her own. Since there are few nuns, they will take little of anyone's",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,24,3,13,14,2,2,4,25,8,16,25,7,0,6,1,0,0,0,0
"30",1566,17,"time. This practice was decided upon after much prayer by many persons including myself -- although wretched -- and among many persons of great learning, intelligence, and prayer. So I hope in the Lord it is the most fitting thing to do. CHAPTER 7
 
Treats of the same subject, spiritual love, and gives some advice on how to obtain it.
 
1. It's strange how impassioned this love is, the tears it costs, the penances and prayer; what concern to ask prayers for the one loved from all who it thinks can help that person toward God; and what constant desire that others recommend him to God. It is not happy unless it sees that person make progress. If, on the other hand, it sees him improving and then sees him turning back somewhat, there doesn't seem to be any pleasure for it in life. It neither eats nor sleeps without this care about the other. It is always fearful lest the soul it loves so much be lost and the two be separated forever. Death here below matters nothing to it, for it doesn't want to become attached to anything that in a mere moment escapes from one's hand and cannot be grasped again. It is, as I said, a love with no self-interest at all. All that it desires or wants is to see the other soul rich with heavenly blessings.
2. This is what love is, and not these other miserable earthly affections -- although I don't mean evil ones, for God deliver us from them. We must never tire of condemning anything that leads to hell, for the slightest evil of hell cannot be exaggerated. We shouldn't let our mouths utter even a word about this sinful love, Sisters, nor should we think that it exists in the world. We shouldn't listen to anything said about it, whether this be done in jest or in truth. Do not allow that this type of love be spoken of or discussed in your presence. Such love has nothing good in it, and even hearing about it can be harmful. You may speak about the licit love I mentioned, which we have for one another or for relatives and friends and in which our care is that our loved ones don't die; or, if the other's head aches our souls seem to ache too, and if they suffer trials, it seems that we lose our patience; and other things like that.
3. Spiritual love is not like this. Even though",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,17,2,14,29,2,4,7,10,5,12,20,8,4,6,2,5,4,12,1
"31",1566,18,"some grief is at first felt through natural weakness, reason immediately considers whether the trial is good for the one loved, whether there is an enrichment in virtue and how that soul bears the suffering; it asks God to give the other patience and merit in the trials. If this love sees that the other person has patience, no distress is felt; rather it rejoices and is consoled. This love would much rather suffer the trial itself than see the other suffer it if the merit and gain that lies in suffering could be given to the other entirely -- but not because this love is disquieted and disturbed.
4. I say once again that spiritual love seems to be imitating that love which the good lover Jesus had for us. Hence, these lovers advance so far because they embrace all trials, and the others, without trial, receive benefit from those who love. And believe me, either these lovers will cut off their relationship -- I mean special friendship -- or they will obtain from our Lord that the one loved walk along their own way toward the same goal, as did St. Monica with St. Augustine. These lovers cannot in their hearts be insincere with those they love; if they see them deviate from the path or commit some faults they immediately tell them about it. They cannot help but do so. And since they are not going to change their attitude, nor are they going to flatter or hide anything from the other, either that other person mends his ways or the friendship is broken. For these lovers cannot suffer such a thing, nor should it be suffered. There is a continual war between the two attitudes these lovers have; on the one hand they go about forgetful of the whole world, taking no account of whether others serve God or not but only keeping account of themselves; on the other hand, with their friends, they have no power to do this, nor is anything covered over; they see the tiniest speck. I say that they bear a truly heavy cross. [Oh fortunate are the souls loved by such as these! Fortunate was the day they came to know them! O my Lord, would you not be doing me a favor if there were many who so loved me? Certainly, it would be more beneficial to me than if I were loved by all the kings and lords of the world; and rightly so, for these persons",3,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,9,2,15,33,2,3,7,8,7,12,15,6,4,2,5,3,1,18,0
"32",1566,19,"strive in as many ways as they can that we ourselves be lords of that very world and that all things be subject to us.
When you know some person like this, Sisters, let the Mother Prioress diligently strive that he speaks with you. Love such persons as much as you like. They must be few, but the Lord does desire that it be known when someone has reached perfection. You will be immediately told that speaking with him is unnecessary, that is enough to have God. But a good means to having God is to speak with His friends, for one always gains very much from this. I know through experience. After the Lord, it is because of persons like these that I am not in hell, for I was always very attached to their praying for me, and so I strove to get them to do this. Now let us return to our subject.]
5. This spiritual love is the kind of love I would desire us to have. Even though in the beginning it is not so perfect, the Lord will gradually perfect it. Let us begin by using the suitable means, for even though the love bears with it some natural tenderness no harm will be done provided this tenderness in shown toward all. It is good and necessary sometimes in loving to show and also have affection, and to feel some of the trials and sicknesses of the Sisters, even though these may be small. For at times it happens that some trifle will cause as much suffering to one as a great trial will to another; little things can bring much distress to persons who have sensitive natures. [And do not be surprised, for perhaps the devil employed all his energy here, more energy than what he uses when you feel great sufferings and trials.] If you are not like them, do not fail to be compassionate. And perhaps our Lord desires to exempt us from these sufferings, whereas in other matters we will suffer. And those sufferings that for us are heavy -- even if in themselves they truly are -- may be light for another. So in these matters let us not judge from ourselves, nor let us think that we are at a stage in which perhaps the Lord without our own effort has made us stronger, but let us think of the stage we were at when we were weaker.
6. Consider that this advice is important for knowing how to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,12,0,8,27,1,1,3,11,6,7,13,11,0,3,3,0,4,4,0
"33",1566,20,"sympathize with your neighbor in his trials, however small they may be. This is especially true in the case of those souls that were mentioned. Since they desire trials they make little of everything, and it is very necessary that they take the time to remember how they themselves were once weak and that if they are not weak now, their strength doesn't come from themselves. For it could be that the devil by this means will make charity toward one's neighbor grow cold, and make us think that what in reality is a fault belongs to perfection. It is necessary to be careful and awake in everything, for he does not sleep. This is truer in the case of those advancing in perfection. The temptations are then very deceiving, since the devil wouldn't dare anything else. It doesn't seem the harm is recognized until it is already done -- if, as I say, one doesn't take care. In sum, it is necessary to watch and pray always, for there is no better remedy than prayer for discovering these secret things of the devil and bringing them to light.
7. Strive also to take time for recreation with the Sisters when there is need and during the time set aside for it by custom, even though this may not be to your pleasure, for everything done with a pure intention is perfect love. [And so it is that when I desire to speak to that other love that is not so perfect, I do not find in this house any path in which I think it would be good for us to have such love. For however good this love might be, everything must hark back to its origin, which is the perfect love I spoke of. I thought of saying much about this other love, and now that I've come to discuss its fine points, I don't think it fits our way of life. So, I want to leave the matter as it stands; I hope in God that in this house there will be no opportunity for any other kind of love then perfect love, even though our love may not be entirely perfect.] Thus, it is very good that some take pity on others in their need. Let them take care that there be no lack of discretion in things that would go against obedience. Even though within yourself the prioress' commands may seem harsh, don't show this or let anyone know about it -- unless,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,1,7,0,8,31,0,0,1,13,10,14,16,20,1,4,1,1,3,9,0
"34",1566,21,"with humility, the prioress herself -- for you would cause much harm. And learn how to understand which are the things one ought to feel sorry about and take pity on with regard to the Sisters. And always grieve over any fault, if it is publicly known, that you see in a Sister. Here love shows itself, and it is practiced well when you know how to suffer the fault and not be surprised; so the others will do with respect to your faults, for you may have many more than you are aware of. Recommend the Sister to God and strive yourself to practice with great perfection the virtue opposite the fault that appears in her. Make every effort to do this so that you teach that Sister in deed what perhaps through words or punishment she might not understand or profit by; and the imitation of the virtue in which one sees another excel has a great tendency to spread. This is good advice; don't forget it.
8. Oh, how good and true will be the love of the Sister who can help others by setting aside her own advantage for their sake. She will make much progress in all the virtues and keep her rule with great perfection. Better friendship will this be than all the tender words that can be uttered, for these are not used, nor should they be used, in this house; those like, ""my life,"" ""my soul,"" ""my only good,"" and other similar expressions addressed now to one, now to another, of the Sisters. Keep these words of affection for your Spouse, for you must be with Him so much and so alone that you will need to be helped by everything; His Majesty allows us to use these words with Him. But if they are used a lot among ourselves, they will not be so touching when used with the Lord. And besides, there's no reason for using them. They are very womanish, and I would not want you, my daughters, to be womanish in anything, nor would I want you to be like women but like strong men. For if you do what lies in your power, the Lord will make you so strong that you will astonish men. And how easy this is for His Majesty since He made us from nothing.
9. Another very good proof of love is that you strive in household duties to relieve others of work, and also rejoice and praise the Lord very much",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,2,1,6,1,12,34,0,2,4,8,18,13,12,10,2,0,2,0,2,3,0
"35",1566,22,"for any increase you see in their virtues. All these things, not to mention the great good they contain in themselves, help very much to further peace and conformity between the Sisters, as we now, by God's goodness, see through experience. May it please His Majesty that this love always continue. The contrary would be a terrible thing, and very difficult to endure: that is, few in number and disunited. God forbid.
10. If by chance some little word should escape, try to remedy the matter immediately and pray intensely. And if things of this sort against charity continue, such as little factions, or ambition, or concern about some little point of honor (for I think my blood freezes when I write about this and think that at some time it could happen, because I see it is the main evil in monasteries); when these things begin to take place consider yourselves lost. Think and believe that you have thrown your Spouse out of the house and have made it necessary for Him to go in search of another dwelling, since you threw Him out of His own house. Cry out to His Majesty. Seek a remedy; for if you don't find one after such frequent confession and Communion, there is reason to fear a Judas among you.
11. Let the prioress for the love of God watch carefully that no place be given to such concerns, and root them out from the beginning; for whether she does this or not will stem either all the harm or all the remedy. [And if love doesn't suffice to do this, let it be done with severe punishments.] And anyone found to be the cause of such disturbance should be sent to another monastery, for God will provide her with the dowry. Get rid of this pestilence; cut off the branches as best you can, and if this is not enough pull up the roots. And if that doesn't work, do not let the one who is taken up with these things leave the prison cell. That's much better than letting so incurable a pestilence infect all the nuns. Oh, how great an evil it is! God deliver us from the monastery where it enters; I would rather that the monastery catch fire and all be burned. Because I believe I shall say something about this elsewhere -- since it is something so important -- I'll not enlarge on it any more here.

The great good that lies in detaching oneself",1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,2,0,2,1,13,0,16,18,3,5,2,10,10,12,21,7,4,1,2,1,2,3,0
"36",1566,23,"inwardly and outwardly from all created things.
 
1. Now let us talk about the detachment we ought to have, for detachment, if it is practiced with perfection, includes everything. I say it includes everything because if we embrace the Creator and care not at all for the whole of creation, His Majesty will infuse the virtues. Doing little by little what we can, we will have hardly anything else to fight against; it is the Lord who in our defense takes up the battle against the demons and against the world.
Do you think, Sisters, it is a small blessing we receive in obtaining this grace to give ourselves to the All entirely and without reserve? And since in Him are all blessings, as I say, let us praise Him very much, Sisters, for having brought us together here where the only concern is to give ourselves entirely to Him. Indeed, I don't know why I am saying this because every one of you here can teach me. I confess that in this matter so important I am not as perfect as I desire or understand to be fitting. And this goes for all the virtues and all that I say here, for it is much easier to write about these things than to put them into practice. And I don't even succeed in writing about them, because sometimes knowing how to speak of them requires experience; and if I do succeed, it is perhaps by writing of the opposite of what I have practiced.
2. With regard to externals, obviously we are separated here from everything. [I think the Lord wants all of us He has gathered together in this house to withdraw from everything so that His Majesty may unite us to Himself here without any hindrance. O my Creator and Lord! When did I merit such honor? For it seems You went a roundabout way to bring us closer to Yourself. May it please Your goodness that we do not lose through our own fault this nearness to You.] O Sisters, understand, for the love of God, the great favor the Lord has granted those whom He brought here. Each of you should reflect upon this carefully, for there are only twelve here and His Majesty desired that you be one of them. And how many there are who are better than I, who I know would take this place eagerly, and the Lord gave it to me who so poorly deserved it! May You be blessed,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,1,12,0,5,26,0,3,1,10,9,9,13,18,1,5,1,0,0,1,0
"37",1566,24,"my God, and may all creatures praise You! One cannot repay You for this favor -- as is likewise so for many others You have granted me -- for my vocation to be a nun was a very great favor! Since I have been so miserable, You did not trust me, Lord. Instead of keeping me where there were so many living together and where my wretchedness would not have been so clearly seen during my lifetime, You have brought me to a place where, since there are so few nuns, it seems impossible for this wretchedness not to be known. That I might walk more carefully, You have removed from me all opportunities to conceal it. Now I confess there is no longer an excuse for me, Lord, and so I have greater need of Your mercy that You might pardon any fault I may have.
3. What I ask of you, Sisters, is that if anyone sees within herself that she is unable to follow what is customarily practiced here she say so; there are other monasteries where the Lord is also served. Do not disturb these few nuns brought here together by His Majesty. In other places there is the freedom to find relief by being with relatives; here if some relatives are allowed to visit, it is that they might find relief by being with us. But the nun who desires to see them for her own consolation, if these relatives are not spiritual persons, should consider herself imperfect. She ought to believe that she is not detached, not healthy; she will not possess freedom of spirit; she will not possess complete peace. She needs a doctor; and I say that if this attachment is not removed and she is not cured, she is not meant for this house.
4. The best remedy I know is that she not see them until obviously she is free and obtains this freedom from the Lord through much prayer. When it is clear that she considers these visits a cross, it will be all right for her to see them, for then she will be of benefit to her relatives and not be harmed herself. [But if she loves her relatives, if she grieves a great deal over their sufferings and eagerly listens to what they tell her about their business affairs in the world, she should believe that she will bring harm to herself and no good to them.]

"38",1566,25,"left the world to flee from relatives and how they find truer friends.
 
1. Oh, if we religious could understand the great harm that comes from having too much to do with relatives! How we would flee them! I don't know what consolation they give us (if in talking with them we leave out what pertains to God and deal only with what pertains to our comfort and rest), for we cannot enjoy their recreations, nor would this be lawful for us. Oh yes, we can grieve over their trials; in fact, we do cry over all their tribulations and sometimes more than they themselves do. Surely, if they give the body some comfort, the spirit pays well for it. You are removed from this here. Since everything is held in common and no one can have any special comfort, the alms they give you are given in a general way; and you are freed from trying to please them on this account, for you know that it is the Lord who provides for all in common.
2. I am astonished by the harm that is caused from dealing with relatives. I don't think anyone will believe it except the one who has experienced it for himself. And how this practice of perfection seems to be forgotten nowadays in religious orders. I don't know what it is in the world that we renounce when we say that we give up everything for God if we do not give up the main thing, namely, our relatives. The situation has reached the state in which it seems to be a lack of virtue for religious not to love and talk a great deal with their relatives, and these religious are not afraid to say and even advance their reasons.
3. In this house, daughters, great care should be taken to recommend them to God; that is right. As for the rest, we should keep them out of our minds as much as possible, because it is a natural thing for the will to become attached to them more than to other persons.
I have been much loved by my relatives -- according to what they have said -- and I loved them so much that I didn't let them forget me. But I know through my own experience as well as that of others that in time of trial my relatives helped me least. It was the servants of God who helped me. By relatives I do not mean parents, for parents very",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,2,10,1,5,21,1,0,2,13,7,10,11,7,0,3,0,1,0,3,0
"39",1566,26,"seldom fail to help their children, and it is right for us to console them in their need. Let us not remain aloof from them if we see that communicating with them does no harm to our religious life. This communication can be carried on with detachment; and so, too, with brothers and sisters.
4. Believe, Sisters, that if you serve His Majesty as you ought, you will not find better relatives than those He sends you. I know that this is so. Convinced of that, as you are here, and understanding that in doing otherwise you would be failing your true Friend and Spouse, believe that in a very short time you will gain this freedom. Believe that you can trust those who love you only for His sake more than you can all your relatives, and that these former will not fail you. And you will find fathers and brothers in those about whom you had not even thought. For since these seek to be repaid by God, they do things for us. Those who seek to be repaid by us soon grow tired, since they see that we are poor and unable to help them in any way. And although this may not be universally so, it is now more usually so; for, after all, the world is the world.
Do not believe whoever tells you to do something else and that it is virtue to do so. For if I should mention all the harm that this association with relatives brings in its wake, I would have to enlarge a great deal. And because others who know what they are saying better than I do have written about this, what I have said should suffice. If I who am so imperfect have understood so much about this, I wonder what those who are perfect know?
5. All that the saints counsel us about fleeing the world is clearly good. Well, believe me, our relatives are what clings to us most from the world, as I have said, and the most difficult to detach ourselves from. Consequently, those who flee from their own countries do well -- if it helps them, I say, for I don't think it helps to flee bodily; rather what helps is that the soul embrace the good Jesus our Lord with determination, for since in Him everything is found, in Him everything is forgotten. Yet, it is a very great help to withdraw even bodily until we have come to know this truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,6,0,6,21,0,0,3,18,5,12,12,10,2,4,0,3,2,1,0
"40",1566,27,"For afterward it may be that the Lord will want us to have dealings with them, giving us a cross where we used to find pleasure. Because I shall treat of this elsewhere, I'll say no more about it here, except that even though your love may not be as perfect as that just mentioned, provided that it goes out toward all in general, I would rather you love one another with tenderness and delight than that there be a moment of discord. May the Lord not permit such discord because of who His Majesty is. Amen. 1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I have praised our Lord that Señor Juan de Ovalle despite this humid weather is better. May it please His Majesty that he continue to improve. My quartan fevers are continuing, and what is worse, the pain of the preceding winters is returning. Last night I slept but little. I believe they will bleed me again. God must have so ordained that it wouldn't appear that everything was the result of being at the Incarnation. The truth of the matter is that this sickness came upon me there, and I have never been without some aftereffects. Perhaps I would fare better there where you are living, and even here the pain up until now has not been as severe as in Avila -- in no way. And if it should come to that, I would be able to bear it better because I don't have as much work.
2. The business affairs with Pedro de la Banda are on good course. Nonetheless, I fear there will be some delay because it is necessary to take the matter to Madrid. Once the authorization is given, I will attend to the workmen, for they have not finished. It seems God wants me to remain here, for there is no one in the house who understands construction or business matters.
3. Yesterday we gave the habit to a young woman of high quality. And I believe she will have something she can contribute to us, and even a great deal. She's made to order -- the daughter of Martín de Avila Maldonado, and her mother is Doña Guiomar de Ledesma. This has been a source of happiness for us. She is delighted and we are with her.

"41",1566,28,"she is well now, without the quartan fevers -- and the prioress also sends them. Greetings to the sisters there, especially the youngest one, for I don't think I'll be able to write, nor do I have anything in particular to say except to ask that they pray for me. May His Majesty make you a saint.
Your servant,
Teresa of Jesus
5. May the Lord repay you for what you do for me, for you are right about what you think is suitable. I have been very happy in learning about the improvement of Señor Juan de Ovalle and that you are in good health, and those angels as well. CHAPTER 10
 
How it is not enough to be detached from what was mentioned if we are not detached from ourselves, and how both this virtue of detachment and humility go together.
 
1. Once we have detached ourselves from the world and from relatives and have enclosed ourselves here under the conditions that were mentioned, it seems that we have done all there is to do and that we don't have to struggle with anything. Oh, my Sisters, do not feel secure or let yourselves go to sleep! By feeling secure you would resemble someone who very tranquilly lies down after having locked his doors for fear of thieves while allowing the thieves to remain inside the house. And you already know that there is no worse thief than we ourselves. For if you do not walk very carefully and if each Sister is not alert in going against her own will as though doing so were more important than all else, there are many things that will take away this holy freedom of spirit by which you can fly to your Maker without being held down by clay or leaden feet.
2. A great aid to going against your will is to bear in mind continually how all is vanity and how quickly everything comes to an end. This helps to remove our attachment to trivia and center it on what will never end. Even though this practice seems to be a weak means, it will strengthen the soul greatly, and the soul will be most careful in very little things. When we begin to become attached to something, we should strive to turn our thoughts from it and bring them back to God -- and His Majesty helps. He has done us a great favor because in this house most of the work of detachment has been done --",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,10,0,10,20,2,1,0,11,9,5,16,5,0,1,2,2,3,0,0
"42",1566,29,"although this turning and being against ourselves is a difficult thing because we live very close together and love ourselves greatly.
3. Here true humility can enter the picture because this virtue and the virtue of detachment it seems to me always go together. They are two inseparable sisters. These are not the relatives I advise you to withdraw from; rather, you should embrace them and love them and never be seen without them. O sovereign virtues, rulers over all creation, emperors of the world, deliverers from all snares and entanglements laid by the devil, virtues so loved by our teacher Christ who never for a moment was seen without them! Whoever has them can easily go out and fight with all hell together and against the whole world and all its occasions of sin. Such a person has no fear of anyone, for his is the kingdom of heaven. He has no one to fear because he doesn't care if he loses everything, nor would he consider this a loss. The only thing he fears is displeasing his God, and he begs God to sustain him in these virtues lest they be lost through his own fault.
4. It is true that these virtues have the characteristic of so hiding themselves from the person who possesses them that he never sees them or manages to believe that he has them even though he is told he does. But he esteems them so highly that he always goes about striving to obtain them, and he gradually perfects them within himself. Yet, they are so manifest in the one who possesses them that without his desiring it, these virtues are at once recognized by others who deal with him.
But what foolishness that I should set about praising humility and mortification when they were so much praised by the King of Glory and so confirmed by His many trials. Now, my daughters, this is the work that must be done in order to escape from the land of Egypt, for in finding these virtues you will find the manna. All things will taste good to you. However bad a thing may taste to those who are in the world, you will find it sweet.
5. Now, then, the first thing we must strive for is to rid ourselves of our love for our bodies, for some of us are by nature such lovers of comfort that there is no small amount of work in this area. And we are so fond of our",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,0,14,27,3,2,3,7,4,8,6,16,4,0,0,1,0,5,2
"43",1566,30,"health that it is amazing what a war our bodies cause, especially with nuns and even with those who are not. But some nuns it seems, including myself, didn't come to the monastery for any other reason than to strive not to die; each one strives for this as best she can. Here, truthfully, there is little opportunity to do this in deed, but I wouldn't want there to be even the desire. Be determined, Sisters, that you came to die for Christ, not to live comfortably for Christ. The devil suggests that you indulge yourselves so that you can keep the observance of the order; and a nun will so eagerly want to strive to care for and preserve her health for the sake of keeping the observance of the order that she dies without ever having kept this observance entirely for so much as a month, nor perhaps for even a day. Well, I don't know why we have come here!
6. Do not fear; very seldom will we lack discretion in this matter, for our confessors will at once be afraid that we may kill ourselves with penances. And the lack of such discretion is so abhorred by us that I wish we'd be so discreet in everything. I know that those who do the opposite will not care that I say this, nor do I care if they say I am judging from myself, for they would be saying the truth. I find for myself that the Lord wishes that we be sickly; at least in my case He granted me a great mercy in my being sick; for since I would have looked after my comfort anyway, He desired that there be a reason for my doing so.
Now it is amusing to see these persons and the torment they put themselves through. Sometimes they feel a desire to do penances without rhyme or reason, a desire that lasts a couple of days, so to speak; subsequently the devil makes them imagine that the penances did them harm. He makes them fear penance, and after some attempts they don't even dare carry out what the order commands. We don't keep some of the very ordinary things of the rule, such as silence, which isn't going to do us any harm. Hardly does our head begin to ache than we stop going to choir, which won't kill us either. [We stay away one day because our head ached, another because it was just now aching, and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,12,6,13,15,3,3,3,11,10,14,12,5,2,6,1,3,7,0,0
"44",1566,31,"three more so that it won't ache again.] And we seek to invent penances in our heads with the result that we can neither do the penances nor keep the observance. And at times the illness is slight, but we think we aren't obliged to do anything since we have done our duty by asking permission.
7. You will ask why the prioress gives it. If she knew what was going on inside us, perhaps she wouldn't give it. But since you tell her about your need and there is no want of a doctor to side with you about the advisability of such permission, or a friend or relative to weep at your side, what can she do? She has a scruple that she might fail in charity. She would rather that you fail than that she herself fail. [And it doesn't seem to her right to judge badly of you. Oh, God help me, this complaining among nuns! May He forgive me, but I fear it has already become a custom. Once there was a nun who complained to me about a headache, and she complained a great deal about it. When it came time to examine her, the head didn't ache at all, but she felt an ache somewhere else.]
8. These are the things that can happen sometimes; that you might be on guard against them, I am putting them down here. For if the devil begins to frighten us about losing our health, we shall never do anything. May the Lord give us the light to be right about everything, amen.

CHAPTER 11
 
Continues to discuss mortification, and speaks about what must be acquired in sickness.
 
1. It seems to me an imperfection, my Sisters, to be always complaining about light illnesses. If you can tolerate them, don't complain about them. When the sickness is serious, it does the complaining itself; this is different and the sickness is immediately obvious. Consider that you are few, and if one has this habit of complaining, it wears everyone out if you have love for one another and there is charity. If someone is truly sick, she should say so and take the necessary remedy. If you have lost self-love, you will feel any self-indulgence so keenly that there is no fear you will take anything without necessity or complain needlessly. If there is some need, it would be worse not to say anything than to seek your comfort without being sick, and it would be very wrong if",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,2,6,0,24,9,3,0,9,10,4,19,28,8,0,3,2,2,13,1,0
"45",1566,32,"the others did not feel compassion for you.
2. Moreover, where there's charity, and so few nuns, concern about your getting well will surely never be lacking. But with regard to some of the weaknesses and little illnesses of women, forget about complaining of them, for sometimes the devil makes us imagine these pains. They are things that come and go. If you do not lose the habit of speaking and complaining about everything -- unless you do so to God -- you will never finish your lamenting. [I insist so much on this because I think it's very important and a reason why monasteries have mitigated their observance.] A fault this body has is that the more comfort we try to give it the more needs it discovers. It's amazing how much comfort it wants; and since in the case of health the need presents itself under the color of some good, however small it may be, the poor soul is deceived and doesn't grow.
3. Remember how many sick people there are who are poor and have no one to complain to; now it is nonsense to think one can be poor and live in comfort. Recall as well many women who are married. I know of some who are persons of high station and who have serious illnesses and heavy trials but for fear of annoying their husbands dare not complain. Well, sinner that I am! Indeed, we have not come here to receive more comfort than they! Oh, you who are free from the great trials of the world, learn how to suffer a little for love of God without having everyone know about it! If a woman in an unhappy marriage suffers much adversity without being able to receive comfort from anyone lest her husband know that she speaks and complains about it, shouldn't we suffer just between ourselves and God some of the illnesses He gives us because of our sins? And even more so because by our complaining the sickness is not alleviated.
4. In all this that I have said I am not dealing with serious illnesses, when there is great fever -- although I beg for moderation and always patience -- but of little ailments, that one can bear on one's feet. But what would happen if this that I'm writing were seen outside the house? What would all the nuns say about me? How willingly I would suffer their talk if someone were to make amends! For if there is but",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,5,10,0,23,18,1,1,7,12,12,13,13,8,2,4,2,2,10,1,0
"46",1566,33,"one nun like this, the situation can reach a point that for the most part no one is believed no matter how serious her sickness may be. Let us remember our holy fathers of the past, those hermits whose lives we aim to imitate. What sufferings they endured! What solitude, cold, and hunger, and what sun and heat, without anyone to complain to but God! Do you think they were made of steel? Well, they were as delicate as we. And believe, daughters, that when we begin to conquer these wretched little bodies, we will not be so troubled by them. There will be enough Sisters to look after what is necessary; forget about yourselves except in what concerns a definite need. If we do not determine once and for all to swallow death and the lack of health, we will never do anything. Strive not to fear them; abandon yourselves totally to God, come what may. So what if we die? If our body has mocked us so often, shouldn't we mock it at least once?
5. And believe that this determination is more important than we realize. For little by little as we grow accustomed to this attitude we shall, with the Lord's help, remain lords of our bodies. Now, then, conquering such an enemy is a very important means to enduring the battle of this life. May the Lord conquer him as He alone can. I truly believe that the benefits coming from this practice are not known except by one who already enjoys the victory. They are so great, from what I believe, that no one would feel he was undergoing trial if he could remain in this calm and dominion.

CHAPTER 12
 
How the true lover of God will have little regard for his own life and honor.
 
1. Let us go on to other things that are also quite important, although they may seem small. Everything seems to be a heavy burden, and rightly so, because it involves a war against ourselves. But once we begin to work, God does so much in the soul and grants it so many favors that all that one can do in this life seems little. And as nuns we do the most we can; that is, we give up our freedom for the love of God, placing it in the power of another, and undergo so many trials and fasts, so much silence, enclosure, and service in choir that however much we may want to please ourselves",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,12,3,12,20,1,5,2,16,4,10,18,9,1,2,3,3,5,2,2
"47",1566,34,"we can only seldom do so. And in many of the monasteries that I have seen, perhaps I am the only one who pleases herself. Why should we, then, delay in practicing interior mortification? For interior mortification makes everything else more meritorious and perfect, and afterward enables us to do the other things with greater ease and repose. This interior mortification is acquired, as I have said, by proceeding gradually, not giving in to our own will and appetites, even in little things, until the body is completely surrendered to the spirit.
2. I repeat that the whole matter, or a great part of it, lies in losing concern about ourselves and our own satisfaction. The least that any of us who has truly begun to serve the Lord can offer Him is our own life. Since we have given the Lord our will, what do we fear? It is clear that if someone is a true religious or a true person of prayer and aims to enjoy the delights of God, he must not turn his back upon the desire to die for God and suffer martyrdom. For don't you know yet, Sisters, that the life of a good religious who desires to be one of God's close friends is a long martyrdom? A long martyrdom because in comparison with the martyrdom of those who are quickly beheaded, it can be called long; but all life is short, and the life of some extremely short. And how do we know if ours won't be so short that at the very hour or moment we determine to serve God completely it will come to an end? This is possible. In sum, there is no reason to give importance to anything that will come to an end. And who will not work hard if he thinks that each hour is the last? Well, believe me, thinking this is the safest course.
3. So, let us try hard to go against our own will in everything. For if you are careful, as I said, you will gradually, without knowing how, find yourselves at the summit. But how extremely rigorous, it seems, to say that we shouldn't please ourselves in anything when we do not also mention the pleasure and delight this going against our will carries in its wake and what is gained by it even in this life. What security! Since all of you practice this denial here, the most is done; for you awaken and help one another. This is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,11,1,4,22,1,1,2,10,9,9,16,14,1,3,2,2,5,0,1
"48",1566,35,"the practice in which each one should strive to be ahead of the others.
4. Take careful note of interior stirrings, especially if they have to do with privileges of rank. God, by His Passion, deliver us from dwelling on such words or thoughts as, ""I have seniority,"" ""I am older,"" ""I have done more work,"" ""the other is treated better than I."" If such thoughts come they should be quickly cut off. If you dwell on them or begin to speak about them, the result is a pestilence from which great evils arise [in monasteries. Be careful, for I know a great deal about it!] If you should have a prioress who consents to this kind of thing, however small, believe that God has permitted, on account of your sins, that you have her as prioress so that you will begin to go astray; and pray hard that He will provide a remedy because you are in great danger.
5. Perhaps you will say: ""Why should I give so much importance to this detachment and be so rigorous about it, for God gives consolations to those who are not so detached?"" I believe He does do this, for in His infinite wisdom He sees that this is fitting so as to draw them to give up everything for Him. I do not call ""giving up everything"" entering religious life, for there can be impediments to entering religious life, and the perfect soul can be detached and humble anywhere; although this latter may involve greater trial, for being in a monastery is a big help. But believe me in one thing: if there is any vain esteem of honor or wealth (and this can be had inside monasteries as well as outside, although inside the occasions for it are more removed and the fault would be greater), you will never grow very much or come to enjoy the true fruit of prayer. And this is so even though you may have many years of experience in prayer -- or, better, I should say reflection because perfect prayer in the end removes these bad habits.
6. Consider, Sisters, whether any of these things pertain to you; you are here for no other purpose. It will be due to your vain esteem of honor that you will not be honored. Moreover, you will lose the benefit you could have otherwise gained; thus dishonor and loss will be joined together here.
Let each one consider how much humility she has, and she will see what",1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,14,0,12,22,2,3,2,9,8,12,16,6,2,3,1,0,2,1,1
"49",1566,36,"progress has been made. It doesn't seem to me the devil will tempt the truly humble person about rank even with the first stirrings. Since he is so shrewd, he fears getting hurt. It is impossible for a person who is humble not to gain strength and progress in humility when the devil tempts him in this way. Clearly, a humble person will reflect on his life and consider how he has served the Lord in comparison with how the Lord ought to be served and the wonders the Lord performed in lowering Himself so as to give us an example of humility; and he will consider his sins and where he merited to be on account of them. The soul ends up with so much gain that the devil doesn't dare return another day lest he get his head crushed.
7. Take this advice from me and do not forget it; do not strive only in an interior way -- for it would be a very great loss if we didn't derive some benefit from these acts of humility -- but strive also in an exterior way that the Sisters draw some benefit from your temptation. If you wish to take revenge on the devil and free yourself more quickly from temptation, ask the prioress as soon as the temptation comes to give you orders to do some lowly task; or, if possible, do it on your own and go about studying how to double your willingness to do things that go contrary to your nature. The Lord will reveal these things to you, and in this way and as a result the temptation will last only a short while. God deliver us from persons who are concerned about honor while trying to serve Him. Consider it an evil gain, and, as I said, honor is itself lost by desiring it, especially in matters of rank. For there is no toxin in the world that kills perfection as do these things.
8. You will say that these are natural little things to which we need pay no attention. Don't fool yourselves, they increase like foam, and there is nothing so small in which there is so obvious a danger as this concern about honor and whether we have been offended. Do you know why -- besides many other reasons? Perhaps this concern begins in someone as something small and amounting to hardly anything, and then the devil stirs another to think it is something big, and this other will",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,3,12,1,19,12,1,5,6,11,8,10,16,4,0,2,0,1,2,0,0
"50",1566,37,"even think she is practicing charity by going and saying to the offended nun, ""How do you put up with such an offense? God give you patience to offer it up; a saint wouldn't suffer more."" The devil puts such malicious talk on the other Sister's tongue that though you barely overcome the offense, you are still tempted to vainglory, when in reality you did not suffer with the perfection with which you should have suffered.
9. And this nature of ours is so weak that merely by telling ourselves that the offense should not be tolerated, we think and believe that we have done something; how much more is this so when we see that others feel this way for us. And a result, the soul loses the occasions it had for meriting; it becomes weaker and opens the door for the devil to come again with something worse. And it could even happen, when you want to suffer the injury, that they will come to you and say: ""Are you a beast or what? It's good for you to feel things."" [Huh, and if one of them is a friend!] Oh, for the love of God, my Sisters! May no one be moved by an indiscreet charity to show pity for another in something that touches upon these false injuries, for such pity is like that of Job's wife and friends. Perform some public mortification also since they are practiced in this house. Flee these temptations of the devil as you would a plague, and don't allow him to stay with you. CHAPTER 13
 
Continues to discuss mortification and how one must flee from the world's maxims and rules about honor in order to arrive at true wisdom.
 
1. I have often told you, Sisters, and now I want to leave it in writing here so that you will not forget it, that in this house -- and even in the case of any person seeking perfection -- you should run a thousand miles from such expressions as: ""I was right."" ""They had no reason for doing this to me."" ""The one who did this to me was wrong."" God deliver us from this poor way of reasoning. Does it seem to have been right that our good Jesus suffered so many insults and was made to undergo so much injustice? I don't know why the nun who doesn't want to carry the cross, except the one that seems to her reasonable, is in the monastery. Let",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,3,3,12,1,20,14,0,5,8,12,11,11,12,5,1,2,3,1,4,1,0
"51",1566,38,"her return to the world, although even there they will not respect such reasonings. Could you by chance suffer as much as you deserve? What kind of reasoning is this? I certainly don't understand it.
2. Let us reason in such a way when some honor is paid to us, or when we are given some comfort or receive good treatment; for certainly it isn't right that we be so treated in this life. When wrongs are done -- that's what they call them without there being any wrong done to us -- I don't know what there is to talk about. Either we are brides of so great a King or we are not. If we are, what honorable woman is there who does not share in the dishonors done to her spouse even though she does not will them? In fact, both spouses share the honor and the dishonor. Now, then, to enjoy a part in His kingdom and want no part in His dishonors and trials is nonsense.
3. May God not allow us to refuse the latter; but the nun to whom it seems she is herself least of all should consider herself the most blessed of all. And she indeed is. If she bears dishonor as it must be borne, she will not be without honor either in this life or in the next. Believe me in this. But what nonsense I have spoken -- that you believe me, when it has been said by true Wisdom, [who is Truth itself, and by the Queen of the angels. Let us, at least, imitate His humility in some way. I say ""in some way,"" for however much we might lower and humble ourselves, someone like myself does nothing; for because of her sins she has merited that the devils humiliate and despise her, even though she wouldn't like their doing so. For even if you may not have so many sins, seldom is there anyone who hasn't done something by which he has merited hell.]
Let us, my daughters, imitate in some way the great humility of the Blessed Virgin, whose habit we wear, for it is embarrassing to call ourselves her nuns. However much it seems to us that we humble ourselves, we fall far short of being the daughters of such a Mother and the brides of such a Spouse.
Thus, if you do not diligently put a stop to the things mentioned, what today seems to be nothing will tomorrow perhaps be a venial sin;",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,11,0,12,23,2,3,2,11,6,9,26,9,0,3,0,1,2,1,0
"52",1566,39,"and it is so dangerous that if you are careless about it you will suffer its ill effects, for it is something very bad for religious communities.
4. We who live in community should be very careful about it so as not to harm those who work to do good for us and give us good example. And if we could understand what great harm is done when a bad custom is begun, we would rather die than be the cause of it. For such a death would be a bodily one, but the loss of souls is a great loss, and it doesn't seem there is any end to the loss. Once some are dead, others follow after; and all, perhaps, are hurt more from a bad custom we have started than from many virtues. For the devil does not allow the bad custom to cease, but natural weakness causes the virtues to be lost.
5. Oh, what a great act of charity and what a great service to God a nun would perform if when she sees she cannot follow the customs of this house she would recognize the fact and leave! And she ought to do so if she doesn't want to go through a hell here on earth; and, please God, there won't be another in the next life, for there are many reasons to fear such perdition, and perhaps neither she nor the others will understand this as I do.
6. Believe me in this matter; and if you don't, time will be my witness. For the style of life we aim to follow is not just that of nuns but of hermits, and thus you detach yourselves from every creature. I see the Lord gives this favor of detachment in a special way to the one He has chosen for this life. Even though the detachment may not be entirely perfect from the beginning, it is seen that she is advancing toward it by the great contentment and happiness she finds in not having to deal again with anything of the world and by how she relishes everything about the religious life.
I repeat that if she is inclined to the things of the world and not seen to be making progress that she should leave. If she still desires to be a nun, let her go to another monastery; and if she doesn't she will see what will happen to her. Don't let her complain about me, who started this way of life, for not",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,12,3,19,17,1,2,6,8,8,19,16,6,5,0,0,1,7,0,0
"53",1566,40,"having warned her.
7. This house is a heaven, if one can be had on this earth. Here we have a very happy life if one is pleased only with pleasing God and pays no attention to her own satisfaction. If a nun desires something in addition to pleasing God, all will be lost because that something cannot be had. The discontented nun is like someone who feels great loathing for food; however good the food may be, it nauseates him, and the food that healthy people find great pleasure in eating is repugnant to such person. This nun will be saved better elsewhere, and it may be that little by little she will reach the perfection that here she couldn't endure because she had to undertake it all at once. For although interiorly it takes time to become totally detached and mortified, exteriorly it must be done immediately. I fear that any nun who walks in such good company and sees that all the other nuns are detached but does not herself make progress in a year will not make more progress in many years, but less. I don't say that the detachment need be as complete as it is with the other nuns, but that you recognize that health is returning; for when the sickness is mortal, the fact becomes immediately obvious.

CHAPTER 14
 
The importance of not allowing anyone to make profession whose spirit goes contrary to the things mentioned.
 
1. I truly believe that the Lord highly favors the one who has real determination. Thus, the intention of the new member should be considered, lest she merely be looking for a secure future, as will be the case with many, although the Lord can bring this intention to perfection if she has good intelligence; but if she doesn't, in no way should she be accepted, for neither will she understand why she is entering, nor afterward will she understand those who desire to lead her along the best spiritual path. For the most part those who have this fault always think they know more about what suits them than do those who are wiser. And the fault is an evil I consider incurable, for it would be a wonder if those having this fault ever gave up their malice. Where there are many nuns this fault could be tolerated, but where there are so few it shouldn't be allowed.
2. When a nun with good intelligence begins to grow attached to good, she takes hold of it",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,15,1,7,28,1,1,1,16,12,16,15,14,2,1,1,0,5,0,4
"54",1566,41,"with fortitude because she sees that doing so is most appropriate. And if her intelligence doesn't help her to attain a high degree of spirituality, it will be useful for giving good counsel and for many other services without being a bother to anyone. If this good intelligence is lacking, I don't know how she can be of any use to the community, and she could be the cause of much harm.
This lack of intelligence is not so quickly noticed. For many speak well but understand poorly; others speak little and without polish but they have the intelligence for a great deal of good. In fact, there is a holy simplicity that knows little about the affairs and style of the world but a lot about dealing with God. Hence much information is necessary before accepting new members and a long probation before admitting them to profession. Let the world understand once and for all that you have the freedom to dismiss the new members and that in a monastery where austerities are practiced, there are many occasions for doing so. And when decisions of this sort become the custom, no one will take the dismissal as an affront.
3. I say this because we are living in such miserable times and our nature is so weak that we don't want to offend relatives, and so it is not enough that we have a command from our forefathers to stop paying attention to what people nowadays take for honor. May it please God that we do not pay in the next life for the new members we admit in this life; there is never a pretext for convincing ourselves that we can't do otherwise. [And in a matter so important no pretext is good, for when the bishop without attachment or passion looks after the good of the house, I don't think God will ever let him be mistaken. And I do believe that there will always be some mistake made if he is affected by such pity and foolish ideas about one's honor.]
4. And this is a matter that each one should consider, recommend to God, and encourage the prioress about, for it's something so important. Thus, I beg God to give you light. You are very fortunate that you do not receive dowries, for it can happen that in monasteries where they are accepted the nuns, so as to avoid giving back the money -- which they no longer have -- leave the thief in the house",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,4,11,0,11,26,2,2,2,17,9,10,12,6,2,3,0,0,4,1,0
"55",1566,42,"who steals the treasure from them; which is a great pity. In this matter you shouldn't take pity on anyone; for you would be doing harm to the person you are trying to help.

CHAPTER 15
 
The great good that lies in not excusing oneself even when blamed without fault.
 
1. [But what disorder in the way I write! Really, it's as though the work were done by one who doesn't know what she's doing. The fault is yours, Sisters, because you are the ones who ordered me to write this. Read it as best you can, for I am writing it as best I can. And if you find that it is all wrong, burn it. Time is necessary to do the work well, and I have so little as you see, for eight days must have gone by in which I haven't written anything. So I forget what I have said and also what I was going to say. Now it is wrong for me to ask you to avoid doing what I have just finished doing, that is, making excuses. For I see that not making excuses for oneself is a habit characteristic of high perfection, and very meritorious; it gives great edification. And although I have often taught it to you, and by God's goodness you practice it, His Majesty has never given it to me.]
I am very embarrassed about what I am going to try to persuade you of, for I should have practiced at least something of what I am about to tell you concerning this virtue. The fact is, I confess, that I have made very little progress. It always seems to me there is some reason for my thinking it is greater virtue to make an excuse for myself. Since at times it is lawful to give an excuse and it would be wrong not to do so, I don't have the discretion or, to put it better, humility to do so when fitting. Indeed, it calls for great humility to be silent at seeing oneself condemned without fault. This is a wonderful way to imitate the Lord who took away all our faults. So, I ask you to take great care about this practice; it brings with it great benefits. I see no reason at all for us to try to excuse ourselves, unless, as I say, in some cases where not telling the truth would cause anger or scandal. When to excuse oneself will be recognized by those who",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,1,0,0,3,0,16,21,2,3,2,8,9,7,10,11,4,4,0,0,0,0,0
"56",1566,43,"have more discretion than I.
2. I believe it's advantageous to get in the habit of practicing this virtue, or to strive to attain from the Lord the true humility that comes from it. The truly humble person must in fact desire to be held in little esteem, persecuted, and condemned without fault even in serious matters. If she desires to imitate the Lord, in what better way can she do so? For here there is no need of bodily strength or help from anyone but God.
3. I should like us, my Sisters, to strive very much for these great virtues; and let us do this penance, for you already know that I am rather strict when there is question of your doing too many penances. They can do harm to one's health if done without discretion. In this practice there is nothing to fear. However great the interior virtues may be, they do not take away the bodily strength necessary to keep the religious observance; on the contrary, they strengthen the soul. And from very little things, as I have said at other times, one can gain the light so as to come out the victor in great things. [But how easily one writes of this and how poorly I practice it!] Indeed, in these great things I have not been able to test this myself, for I have never heard anything evil said of me that I didn't see that it fell short; for even though I had not failed in the things they accused me of, I have offended God in many other areas, and it seemed to me they were being quite kind by not mentioning these other offenses. I am always happier that they speak about what is not true of me than the truth.
4. It is a great help to reflect upon the many things that are gained through all the various ways and how -- if we observe carefully -- we are never, never blamed without there being faults on our part, for we always go about full of them since the just man falls seven times a day, and it would be a lie to say we have no sin. Thus even though we are blamed for faults we haven't committed, we are never entirely without fault, as was the good Jesus.
5. O my Lord, when I think of the many ways You suffered and how You deserved none of these sufferings, I don't know what to say about myself, nor",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,10,0,15,22,1,5,2,7,6,10,11,17,1,6,0,2,1,0,0
"57",1566,44,"do I know where my common sense was when I didn't want to suffer, nor where I am when I excuse myself. You already know, my Good, that if I have some good it is a gift from no one else's hands but Yours. Now, Lord, what costs You more, to give much or little? If it is true that I have not merited this good, neither have I merited the favors You have granted me. Is it possible that I have wanted anyone to feel good about a thing as bad as I after so many evil things have been said about You who are the Good above all goods? Don't allow, don't allow, my God -- nor would I ever want You to allow -- that there be anything in Your servant that is displeasing in Your eyes. Observe, Lord, that mine are blind and satisfied with very little. Give me light and grant that I may truly desire to be abhorred by all since I have so often failed You who have loved me so faithfully.
6. What is this, my God? What do we expect to obtain from pleasing creatures? What does it matter if we are blamed a lot by all of them if in Your presence we are without fault? O my Sisters, we never completely understand this virtue; so, we are never completely perfect if we do not reflect and think a great deal upon what is and what is not. For when you have no other gain than the embarrassment of the person who after having blamed you sees that you are in fact without fault and yet allow yourself to be condemned, that gain is extremely great. At times something like this elevates a soul more than ten sermons. We must all try to be preachers through our deeds since the Apostle and our incapacity prevent us from being preachers through our words.
7. However enclosed you are, never think that the good or evil you do will remain a secret. And do you think, daughters, that when you do not excuse yourselves there will be lacking someone to defend you? Observe how the Lord answered for the Magdalene both in the house of the Pharisee and when her sister accused her. He will not be as harsh with you as He was with Himself, for at the time that one of the thieves defended Him, He was on the cross. So His Majesty will inspire someone to defend you; and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,9,0,11,21,1,4,2,12,7,13,17,16,3,1,2,2,1,1,0
"58",1566,45,"when He doesn't, the defense won't be necessary. I have seen this, and it is true. But I wouldn't want you to be thinking about being defended, but that you rejoice in being blamed; and time will be the witness to the benefit you will see in your soul. For one begins to obtain freedom and doesn't care whether they say good or evil of him but rather thinks of what is said as though it were another's affair. The situation is like that in which we have two persons talking together but not to us; we then don't care about answering. So it is here; with the habit that has been acquired of not responding, it doesn't seem they are speaking to us.
This will seem impossible to those of us who are very sensitive and little mortified. In the beginning it is difficult; but I know that such freedom, self-denial, and detachment from ourselves can, with God's help, be attained. Oh, what a great act of charity and what a great service to God a nun would perform if when she sees that she cannot follow the practices of perfection and customs of this house she would recognize the fact and go, and leave the others in peace! And they shouldn't keep her in any of the monasteries -- at least if they believe me -- nor allow her to make profession until after many years of trial to see if she makes amends. I am not referring to failures in the penance and fasts. Even though these are faults, such failures are not things that cause so much harm. But I am speaking about persons who by temperament like to be esteemed and honored and who look at the faults of others and never at their own, and other similar things that truly arise from lack of humility. If God doesn't favor her with a great spiritual gift and if after many years you don't see her make amends, may He free you so that she doesn't remain in your company. Realize that she won't be at peace nor will she allow anyone else to be. Since you do not accept a dowry, God grants you the freedom to send a nun away. What I pity about monasteries is that often, so as not to return the money, they allow the thief to steal the treasure from them, or they do so for the sake of the relatives' honor. In this house you have risked and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,3,11,0,13,24,1,3,3,11,8,13,13,6,6,4,0,0,0,0,0
"59",1566,46,"lost the honor of this world, for the poor receive no honor. Don't desire that others have it at such a cost to yourselves. Our honor, Sisters, must be to serve God. If someone becomes a hindrance to your doing this, she should remain at home with her honor. For this reason our fathers ordained a one-year probation, and in our order we have the faculty to delay the profession for four years. And in this house I would like to delay it even ten years. A humble nun will not mind a delay of profession. She already knows that if she is good they will not dismiss her; if she is not good, why does she desire to do harm to this college of Christ? In saying 'not good,' I am not speaking of some vanity; for, with God's help, I hope such a thing will stay far from this house. In saying 'not good,' I mean not being mortified but being attached to worldly things or to oneself in the matters I have mentioned. And the nun who doesn't see much detachment in herself should believe me and not make profession, if she doesn't want to have a hell here below. And please God she will not have another in the next life, for there are many things in her that could cause such a misfortune; and perhaps those in the house will not understand them, nor perhaps will she, as I have understood them. These false accusations, no matter how serious, did not disturb me. But in little things I followed my nature -- and continue to follow it -- without paying attention to what is more perfect. Hence I would like each of you to begin early to understand and reflect upon the much that is gained through all the various ways, and that no one, in my opinion, loses by following any of them. The main thing gained is that in some manner we follow the Lord. I say 'in some manner,' because, as I have mentioned, we are never blamed without our having faults. CHAPTER 16
 
The difference that must lie between the perfection of the life of contemplatives and that of those who are simply content with the practice of mental prayer. How it is possible that God may at times raise a distracted soul to perfect contemplation and the reason for His doing so. This chapter and the following one are very noteworthy.

"60",1566,47,"said so far is all I have to say, for I am just setting up the game, as they say. You asked me to mention something about the foundation for prayer. Even though God did not lead me by means of this foundation, for I still don't have these virtues, I know of no other. Now realize that anyone who doesn't know how to set up the pieces for a game of chess won't know how to play well. And if he doesn't know how to check his opponent's king, he won't know how to checkmate it either. Well, you will reprimand me because I am speaking about a game we do not have in this house, nor should we have it. Here you see the kind of Mother God has given you, that she even knows about this vanity; although they say that sometimes the game is permissible. And oh, how permissible this kind of game will be for us; and how quickly, if we play it often, will we checkmate this divine King, who will not be able to escape, nor will He want to.
2. The queen is the piece that can carry on the best battle in this game, and all the other pieces help. There's no queen like humility for making the King surrender. Humility drew the King from heaven to the womb of the Virgin, and with it, by one hair, we will draw Him to our souls. And realize that the one who has more humility will be the one who possesses Him more; and the one who has less will possess Him less. For I cannot understand how there could be humility without love or love without humility; nor are these two virtues possible without detachment from all creatures.
3. You will ask me, daughters, why I am speaking to you about virtues when you have enough books to teach you about them, and you will say that you want to hear only about contemplation. I say that had you asked about meditation I could have spoken about it and counseled all to practice it even though they do not possess the virtues, for meditation is the basis for acquiring all the virtues, and to undertake it is a matter of life and death for all Christians. And no one, however lost he may be, should set it aside if God has awakened him to so great a good, as I have already written elsewhere and as have many others who know",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,12,1,1,10,1,3,17,0,1,1,12,14,9,10,6,1,10,1,2,1,4,0
"61",1566,48,"what they are writing about; for I certainly don't know what I'm writing about -- God knows.
4. But contemplation is something else, daughters. This is the mistake we all make, that if a person spends a little time each day thinking about his sins -- for he is obliged to do that if he is a Christian more than in name -- they immediately say he is a very contemplative soul and they want him to possess at once virtues as great as those a very contemplative soul is obliged to have; and even the person himself wants this, but is mistaken. In the beginning he didn't know how to set up the game. He thought it was enough to know the pieces in order to checkmate the King. But that was impossible, for this King doesn't give Himself but to those who give themselves entirely to Him.]
5. Therefore, daughters, if you desire that I tell you about the way that leads to contemplation, you will have to bear with me if I enlarge a little on some other matters even though they may not seem to you so important; for in my opinion they are. And if you don't want to hear about them or to put them into practice, stay with your mental prayer for your whole life, for I assure you and all persons who aim after true contemplation (though I could be mistaken since I am judging by myself for whom it took twenty years) that you will not thereby reach it.
6. I now want to explain -- because some of you don't know -- what mental prayer is, and please God we shall practice this as it ought to be practiced. But I fear that mental prayer also involves much labor if the virtues are not obtained -- although it's not necessary that they be possessed in as high a degree as is required for contemplation. I say that the King of glory will not come to our soul -- I mean to be united with it -- if we do not make the effort to gain the great virtues. I want to explain this because if you should catch me saying something that isn't true you wouldn't believe anything, and you would be right if I did so knowingly; but God forbid! If I should say something that isn't true, it would be a matter of my not knowing more or not understanding. I want to say, then, that there are times",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,11,0,6,13,1,0,0,20,8,28,21,9,0,6,0,0,1,0,0
"62",1566,49,"when God will want to grant some great favor to persons who are in a bad state so as to draw them by this means out of the hands of the devil.
7. O my Lord, how often do we make You fight the devil in arm to arm combat! Isn't it enough that You allowed him to take You in his arms when he carried You to the pinnacle of the temple so that You might teach us how to conquer him? But what would it be like, daughters, to see him, with his darknesses, next to the Sun. And what fear that unfortunate one must have borne without knowing why, for God didn't allow him to understand it. Blessed be such compassion and mercy. What shame we Christians ought to have for making Him wrestle arm to arm, as I have said, with so foul a beast. It was truly necessary, Lord, that you have such strong arms. But how is it that they didn't weaken by the many torments You suffered on the cross? Oh, how everything that is suffered with love is healed again! And so I believe that had You survived, the very love You have for us would have healed Your wounds, for no other medicine was necessary. [It seems I am speaking nonsense, but I'm not; for divine love can do greater things than these. But to avoid seeming strange -- which I really am -- and so as not to give you bad example, I'll say no more.] O my God, grant that I might put medicine like this in everything that causes me pain and trial! How eagerly I would desire these if I could be sure that I'd be healed with so soothing a balm!
8. To return to what I was saying, there are souls that God thinks He can win to Himself by these means. Since He sees they are completely lost, His Majesty desires that nothing be wanting on His part. And even though they are in a bad state and lacking in virtue, He gives them spiritual delight, consolation, and tenderness that begin to stir the desires. And He even places them in contemplation sometimes, though He does so rarely and it lasts only a short while. He does this, as I say, so as to try them to see if with that favor they will want to prepare themselves to enjoy Him often. But if they don't prepare themselves -- pardon me; or better, may",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,15,0,16,21,3,1,3,9,12,16,13,8,3,5,1,7,9,3,0
"63",1566,50,"You pardon us, Lord, for it is a great evil when after You bring a soul like this to Yourself it approaches and becomes attached to some earthly thing.
9. For myself I hold that there are many to whom our Lord God gives this test, but few who prepare themselves for the enjoyment of the favor of contemplation. When the Lord grants it and we do not fail on our part, I hold as certain that He never ceases to give until we reach a very high degree. When we do not give ourselves to His Majesty with the determination with which He gives Himself to us, He does a good deal by leaving us in mental prayer and visiting us from time to time like servants in His vineyard.. But these others are favored children. He would not want them to leave His side, nor does He leave them, for they no longer want to leave Him. He seats them at His table, He shares with them His food even to the point of taking a portion from His own mouth to give them.
10. Oh, blessed care, my daughters! Oh, blessed renunciation of things so small and so base that reaches so high a state. What would it matter, when you are in the arms of God, if the whole world blamed you! He has the power to free you from everything, for once He commanded that the world be made, it was made; His will is the deed. Now do not fear that He will allow others to speak against you except for the benefit of one who loves Him. His love for those who love Him is not so small. Well why, my Sisters, shouldnt we show our love for Him as much as we can? Behold it is a beautiful exchange to give our love for His. Consider that He can do all things, and we cant do anything here below but what He enables us to do. Well, what is this that we do for You, Lord, our Maker? It amounts to almost nothing, just a little determination. Well, if from that which is nothing His Majesty desires us to merit everything, lets not be foolish.
11. O Lord, how true that all harm comes to us from not keeping our eyes fixed on You; if we were to look at nothing else but the way, we would soon arrive. But we meet with a thousand falls and obstacles and lose the way because",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,2,11,0,7,27,1,2,2,5,7,9,6,7,3,1,0,3,0,5,1
"64",1566,51,"we dont keep our eyes  as I say  on the true way. It seems so new to us that you would think we had never walked on it. Its certainly something to excite pity, that which sometimes happens. [I say that it doesnt seem we are Christians or that we ever in our lives read the Passion. God help me, if I neglect a little rule concerning someones honor! If anyone tells you not to worry about your honor, he at once seems to be unchristian. I laughed to myself  or rather was distressed  at what I sometimes saw in the world and even, because of my sins, in religious communities.] For any slight loss in one's honor is not tolerated, nor does it seem that such a loss should be tolerated. They immediately say: ""We're not saints.""
12. God deliver us, Sisters, when we do something imperfect, from saying: ""We're not angels, we're not saints."" Consider that even though we're not, it is a great good to think that if we try we can become saints with God's help. And have no fear that He will fail if we don't fail. Since we have not come here for any other thing, let us put our hands to the task, as they say. May we presume to use everything we learn about greater service of the Lord in His favor. The presumption I would like to see present in this house, for it always makes humility grow, is to have a holy daring; for God helps the strong and He shows no partiality.
13. I have digressed a good deal. I want to return to what I was saying, that is, explaining the nature of mental prayer and of contemplation. It may seem impertinent for me to be doing that, but for you everything is acceptable. It may be that you will understand the matter better through my rough style than through other more elegant styles. May the Lord help me, amen.

CHAPTER 17
 
Not all souls are suited for contemplation, and some reach it late. The truly humble person must be content with the path along which God leads him.
 
1. It seems I am already dealing with prayer. But something still remains to be said that is very important because it pertains to humility and is necessary in this house where the main occupation is prayer. And, as I said, it is only right that you should try to understand how to train yourselves a",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,2,0,20,0,10,21,3,0,6,19,7,11,26,11,3,8,2,2,0,1,0
"65",1566,52,"great deal in humility. In fact, this is an important aspect of prayer and indispensable for all persons who practice it. How could a truly humble person think he is as good as those who are contemplative? Yes, it is true, God can make you a contemplative -- through His goodness and mercy; but, in my opinion, one should always take the lowest place, for this is what the Lord told us to do and taught us in deed. Prepare yourself so that God may lead you along this path if He so desires. When He doesn't, you can practice humility, which is to consider yourself lucky to serve the servants of the Lord and praise His Majesty because He brought you among them and drew you away from the devils in hell where you deserved to be a slave of these devils.
2. I don't say this without serious cause, because, as I have said, it is important to understand that God doesn't lead all by one path, and perhaps the one who thinks she is walking along a very lowly path is in fact higher in the eyes of the Lord.
So, not because all in this house practice prayer must all be contemplatives; that's impossible. And it would be very distressing for the one who isn't a contemplative if she didn't understand the truth that to be a contemplative is a gift from God; and since being one isn't necessary for salvation, nor does God demand this, she shouldn't think anyone will demand it of her. So, you will not fail to be very perfect if you do what has been mentioned. Indeed, it could be that a Sister will gain much more merit because she must work harder and the Lord leads her as one who is strong, saving for her what she doesn't enjoy here below so as to give it to her all at once. Not for this reason should she grow fainthearted or give up prayer or what all the other Sisters are doing, for sometimes the Lord comes very late and pays just as well, and all at once, what He was giving to others in the course of many years.
3. I spent fourteen years never being able to practice meditation without reading. There will be many persons of this sort, and others who will be unable to meditate even with the reading but able only to pray vocally, and in this vocal prayer they will spend most of their time. There",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,4,1,4,23,0,8,16,1,1,3,12,12,13,13,19,1,2,1,1,1,0,0
"66",1566,53,"are minds so active they cannot dwell on one thing but are always restless, and to such an extreme that if they want to pause to think of God, a thousand absurdities, scruples, and doubts come to mind.
I know an elderly person who lives a good life, is penitential and an excellent servant of God, who has spent many hours for many years in vocal prayer, but in mental prayer she's helpless; the most she can do is go slowly in reciting the vocal prayers. There are a number of other persons of this kind. If humility is present, I don't believe they will be any the worse off in the end but will be very much the equals of those who receive many delights; and in a way they will be more secure, for we do not know if the delights are from God or from the devil. Now if the delights are not from God, there is greater danger because the work of the devil here is to instigate pride. But if they are from God, there is nothing to fear; they bring with them humility, as I have written very much at length in another book.
4. Those who do not receive these delights walk with humility, suspecting that this lack is their own fault, always concerned about making progress. They don't see anyone shed a tear without thinking that if they themselves don't shed any they are very far behind in the service of God. And perhaps they are much more advanced, for tears, even though they be good, are not all perfect. In humility, mortification, detachment, and the other virtues there is always greater security. There is nothing to fear; don't be afraid that you will fail to reach the perfection of those who are very contemplative.
5. St. Martha was a saint, even though they do not say she was contemplative. Well now, what more do you want than to be able to resemble this blessed woman who merited so often to have Christ our Lord in her home, give Him food, serve Him, and eat at table with Him [and even from His plate]? If she had been enraptured like the Magdalene, there wouldn't have been anyone to give food to the divine Guest. Well, think of this congregation as the home of St. Martha and that there must be people for every task. And those who are led by the active life shouldn't complain about those who are very much absorbed in",2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,1,2,1,16,0,16,21,6,1,3,9,3,13,16,8,1,1,0,0,3,0,3
"67",1566,54,"contemplation, for these active ones know that the Lord will defend the contemplatives, even though these latter are silent since for the most part contemplation makes one forgetful of self and of all things.
6. Let them recall that it is necessary for someone to prepare His meal and let them consider themselves lucky to serve with Martha. Let them consider how true humility consists very much in great readiness to be content with whatever the Lord may want to do with them and in always finding oneself unworthy to be called His servant. If contemplating, practicing mental prayer and vocal prayer, taking care of the sick, helping with household chores, and working even at the lowliest tasks are all ways of serving the Guest who comes to be with us and eat and recreate, what difference does it make whether we serve in the one way or the other?
7. I don't say that we shouldn't try; on the contrary, we should try everything. What I am saying is that this is not a matter of your choosing but of the Lord's. If after many years He should give to each a certain task, it would be a nice kind of humility for you to want to choose for yourselves. Leave it up to the Lord of the house; He is wise, He is mighty, He understands what is suitable for you and what is suitable for Him as well. Be sure that if you do what lies in your power, preparing yourselves for contemplation with the perfection mentioned, and that if He doesn't give it to you (and I believe He will give it if detachment and humility are truly present), He will save this gift for you so as to grant it to you all at once in heaven. And, as I have said before, He wants to lead you as though you were strong, giving you the cross here below, something that His Majesty always had. What better friendship than that He desire for you what He desired for Himself? And it could be that you would not have received so great an award in contemplation. The judgments are His, there's no reason for us to become involved in them. It is good that the choice is not up to us, for then -- since contemplation seems a more restful path -- we would all be great contemplatives.
O wonderful gain, not to want to gain from following our own judgment lest we suffer any loss! God,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,8,0,4,25,0,1,3,21,7,18,13,13,0,4,0,0,1,0,2
"68",1566,55,"in fact, never permits any loss to come to a person truly mortified save for a greater gain.

CHAPTER 18
 
Continues on the same subject and tells how the trials of contemplatives are much greater than those of persons living an active life. This chapter is very consoling for these latter.
 
1. Now, daughters, I tell those of you whom God does not lead by this path that from what I have seen and understood concerning the lives of those who do walk along it, contemplatives do not bear a lighter cross; and you would be surprised at the ways and modes in which God gives them crosses. I know both paths, and I know clearly that the trials God gives to contemplatives are intolerable. These trials are of such a kind that if He didn't give that food with its delights, these persons wouldn't be able to endure the trials. And it is clear that since God wants to lead those whom He greatly loves by the path of tribulation -- and the more He loves them the greater the tribulation -- there is no reason to think that He despises contemplatives, for with His own mouth He praises them and considers them His friends.
2. Well, to think that He admits into His intimate friendship people who live in comfort and without trials is foolish. I am very certain that God gives contemplatives much greater trials. Thus, since He leads them along a rough and uneven path and at times they think they are lost and must return to begin again, His Majesty needs to give them sustenance, and not water but wine so that in their inebriation they will not understand what they are suffering and will be able to endure it. So, I see few true contemplatives who are not courageous and determined to suffer, for the first thing the Lord does, if they are weak, is to give them courage and make them unafraid of trials.
3. I believe that when those of the active life see the contemplative favored a little, they think there is nothing else to the contemplative's life than receiving favors. Well, I say that perhaps these active persons couldn't endure one day of the kind the contemplative endures. Thus, since the Lord knows what each one is suited for, He gives to each person a proper task, one that He sees as appropriate for that person's soul, for the service of the Lord Himself and for the good of neighbor. And",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,0,10,0,7,23,0,1,4,23,12,8,4,8,4,1,1,1,5,2,3
"69",1566,56,"if you have done what you can to be prepared, do not fear that your effort will be lost. Keep in mind that I say we should all try to be contemplatives, since we are not here for any other reason. And we should try not for just a year, nor for only two, nor even for just ten; otherwise we leave the impression that we are giving up as cowards; and it is good for the Lord to know we are doing our best. We must be like soldiers who even though they may not have served a great deal must always be ready for any duty the captain commands them to undertake, since it is he who gives them their salary. And how much better the pay our King gives than the pay of earthly kings.
4. Since the captain sees his soldiers present and eager to serve and has understood the capability of each one, he distributes the duties according to the strengths he sees. And if these soldiers were not present, he wouldn't give them anything, nor would he command them to serve.
So it is with us, Sisters; let us give ourselves to mental prayer. And let whoever cannot practice it turn to vocal prayer, reading, and colloquy with God, as I shall say afterward. Do not abandon the hours of prayer we have in common; you don't know when the Spouse will call -- let not what happened to the foolish virgins happen to you. He may want to give more work, disguised in delight. If He doesn't, you should understand that this delight is not meant for you, that it is fitting for you to go without it. And here is where meriting through humility enters; one truly believes that he isn't even capable of doing the little he does.
5. You should be happy to serve in what they command you to do, as I have said. And if this humility is true, blessed be such a servant in the active life, for she will not complain but of herself. [I would much rather be like her than like some contemplatives.] Let the others fight their own war, which is not small. Even though the standard-bearer doesn't fight in the battle, he doesn't for that reason fail to walk in great danger; and interiorly he must do more work than anyone. Since he carries the flag, he cannot defend himself; and even though they cut him to pieces he must not let it",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,9,1,0,3,6,1,12,21,1,6,3,10,7,17,11,8,2,3,0,0,1,1,0
"70",1566,57,"out of his hands. So it is with contemplatives: they must keep the flag of humility raised and suffer all the blows they receive without returning any. Their duty is to suffer as Christ did, to hold high the cross, not to let it out of their hand whatever the dangers they see themselves in, nor let any weakness in suffering be seen in them; for this reason they are given so honorable an office. The contemplative must be careful about what he is doing, for if he lets go of the flag the battle will be lost. Thus, I believe that great harm is done to those who are not so advanced when they see that the deeds of those they consider to be captains already and friends of God are not in conformity with this office.
6. The other soldiers advance as best they can, and sometimes they retreat from where they see greater danger; and no one notices this, nor do these soldiers lose honor. As for the former ones, the eyes of all are upon them; they cannot stir. So their office is a good one, and the king does a great honor and favor to the one he gives it to, but the obligation in accepting it is not a small one.
So, Sisters, we don't know what we are asking for. Let us leave it to the Lord. [For He knows us better than we do ourselves. And true humility is content with what is received.] There are some persons who demand favors from God as though these were due them in justice. That's a nice kind of humility! Thus, He who knows all very seldom grants such persons favors, and rightly so. He sees clearly that they are not ready to drink from the chalice.
7. What each of you will understand, daughters, if you are advanced, will be that you are the most wretched of all. And this understanding will be manifested in deeds done for your own spiritual growth and for the good of others, and not in having more delights and raptures in prayer, or visions, or favors of this kind that the Lord grants; for we shall have to wait for the next world to see the value of such experiences. This understanding is like current coin, like unfailing revenue, like having a perpetual annuity and not a sum that's paid only once; for these other experiences come and go. This attitude includes the great virtues of humility and mortification,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,4,7,0,10,26,0,3,5,13,3,4,9,8,7,0,2,3,1,0,1
"71",1566,58,"careful obedience by not in any way going against what the superior commands, for you truly know that God, in whose place the superior stands, commands it.
It is into this obedience that you must put the most effort; and, in my opinion, where there is no obedience there are no nuns. I am not saying anything about this virtue because I am speaking with nuns and, I think, good ones -- at least they desire to be good. In a matter of such wisdom and importance, no more than a word so that it won't be forgotten.
8. I say that I don't know why a nun under obedience by vow is in the monastery if she doesn't make every effort to practice this obedience with greater perfection. At least I can assure her that as long as she fails in obedience she will never attain to being a contemplative, nor will she even be a good active Sister; and I hold this as very, very certain. Even though a person may not have this obligation of the vow, if he desires or aims after contemplation, it is necessary for him in order to proceed correctly to give up his will, with complete determination, to a confessor, who must be the kind [that will understand him.] Since this practice is something already well known -- for there is more progress made in this way in one year then without it in many -- and it is not necessary for you, there's no need to talk of it.
9. I conclude by saying that these are the virtues I desire you to have, my daughters, the ones you must strive for and about which you should have holy envy. As for those other devotions, there's no need to be sorry about not having them; having them is an uncertain matter. It could be that in other persons they may be from God, whereas in your case His Majesty may permit them to be an illusion of the devil and that you be deceived by him, as were other persons [for in women this is something dangerous]. Why desire to serve the Lord in a doubtful way when you have so much that is safe? Who places you in these dangers?
10. I have enlarged so much on this subject because I know it is important; for this nature of ours is weak, and His Majesty will strengthen anyone to whom He wishes to give contemplation, I have paused to give these counsels",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,10,0,9,21,2,3,1,12,15,14,15,13,0,4,0,0,1,0,0
"72",1566,59,"to those to whom He doesn't give contemplation. By practicing them, the contemplatives, also, may humble themselves. [If, daughters, you say that you don't need them, perhaps someone else will come along who will be pleased to have them.]
May the Lord, because of who He is, give us light to follow His will in everything, and there will be nothing to fear. It often happens that the Lord favors a soul that is in a very wretched state. It should be understood that it is not then in mortal sin, in my opinion. God will permit someone who is in mortal sin to see a vision -- even a very good one -- so as to bring that person back to Himself. But I cannot believe that He would place such a person in contemplation. For in that divine union the Lord delights in the soul and the soul in Him. It's incongruous that the purity of heaven would delight in a soul stained with sin or that the delight of the angels would find comfort in what is not His. Now we know that by sinning mortally a soul belongs to the devil; it can delight in him since it has satisfied him, and we already know that his delights are a continual torment even in this life. The Lord will always have devoted sons in whom He can be consoled. He has no need to go about taking those who do not belong to Him, although His Majesty will do what He often does: snatch them from the devil's hands. and how well he deserved on account of his boldness that God should create a new hell for him I know an elderly nun -- please God my life were as good as hers -- who is very holy and penitential. She is a great nun and recites much vocal and very ordinary prayer. To my Padre and Señor, Maestro Fray Domingo Báñez.
1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and in my soul. When I was sick I wrote you a long letter telling you about the ups and downs of my health, and sent it by way of Medina -- I don't know why they didn't deliver it. Now I would also like to write at length, but I have many letters to write and I am feeling cold, for it is the day of the quartan fever.

2. I praise our Lord for the news I hear about your sermons, and I am very envious. And now, since you are the superior of that house, I feel a longing to be there. But when have you ceased being my superior? If I were there, though, it seems to me I would experience a new joy. But since I don't deserve anything but the cross, I praise him who gives it to me always.
3. I was delighted with those letters of Father Visitator to you, mi padre. Not only is that friend of yours a saint, but he knows how to show it, and if his words do not contradict his deeds, he proceeds very wisely. And although what he says is true, he will not fail to admit her, because between lords and lords the difference is great.
4. The Princess of Eboli as a nun was something to cry over. That angel there, as a nun, can be of benefit to other souls, and the greater the outcry, all the more! I find no drawbacks. The worst that can happen is that she leave, but the Lord in the meantime will have drawn out, as I say, other benefits and perhaps have stirred some soul who otherwise without this means might have been condemned. Great are God's judgments, and there is no reason for us to deny admission to one who loves him so authentically when she is in the danger that all these illustrious people are in. Nor should we refuse to bear the trial of some disturbance in exchange for so great a good. To make her wait, it seems to me, would be like going along with the world and copying its ways, and it would be a torment to her. It is clear that even if she did change her mind during the thirty days, she would not say so. But if such a delay would placate her parents, justify her cause, and provide for the waiting period your honor desires -- it would be no more, I repeat, than a delay -- may God be with her. For it is impossible for whoever gives up much not to receive much from God since he gives so much to us who have given up nothing.

6. I greatly pity the nuns in Pastrana. Even though the princess has returned home, they are like captives, for the prior of Atocha went there and did not dare visit them. Now she is also mad at the friars. I don't know why they should have to put up with such slavery. I am doing well with Padre Medina. I think that if I were to speak with him often, everything would soon be smoothed over. He is so busy that I hardly see him ...

The love of God permits many things; if it is in the least bit lacking, everything would be finished. Your difficulty, it seems, is to write at length; mine is to be brief. Nonetheless, you do me a great favor because I do not grow sad when I see a bundle of letters and yours is not among them. May God keep you. It doesn't seem this letter should ...

Begins to discuss prayer. Speaks to souls unable to reason with the intellect.
 
1. So many days have gone by since I wrote the above, days in which I haven't had time to return to it, that if I don't reread it I won't know what I was saying. So as not to take up time, I'll have to let this work turn out in whatever way it does, without any order. There are so many good books written by able persons for those who have methodical minds and for",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,4,10,1,7,17,0,3,3,8,8,11,14,5,2,4,1,0,0,1,0
"75",1566,62,"souls that are experienced and can concentrate within themselves that it would be a mistake if you paid attention to what I say about prayer. As I say, there are books in which the mysteries of the Lord's life and Passion are divided according to the days of the week, and there are meditations about judgment, hell, our nothingness, and the many things we owe God together with excellent doctrine and method concerning the beginning and end of prayer. There is nothing for me to say to anyone who can form the habit of following this method of prayer, or who has already formed it, for by means of so good a path the Lord will draw him to the haven of light. And through such a good beginning the end will be reached. All who are able to walk along this path will have rest and security, for when the intellect is bound one proceeds peacefully.
But what I would like to speak about and offer a remedy for, if the Lord should will that I succeed -- and if I don't, at least you will understand that there are many souls who undergo this trial, and those of you who suffer it will not grow weary -- is the following.
2. There are some souls and minds so scattered they are like wild horses no one can stop. Now they're running here, now there, always restless. [And if the rider is skillful, there is not always a danger -- just sometimes. But even though his life is in no danger, he is not free from some dishonor in mounting the wild horse; and there is always some hardship.] This restlessness is either caused by the soul's nature or permitted by God. I pity these souls greatly, for they seem to be like very thirsty persons who see water in the distance, but when they want to go there, they meet someone who prevents their passing from the beginning through the middle to the end. It happens that after they have conquered the first enemy through their labor -- and through a great deal of labor -- they let themselves be conquered by the second; they would rather die of thirst than drink water so costly. Their efforts cease, their courage fails. And when some have the courage to conquer the second class of enemy as well, their strength gives way when they meet the third, and perhaps they were no more than two steps from the fount of",2,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,4,14,1,11,17,2,5,3,5,2,11,16,4,1,4,0,2,3,1,5
"76",1566,63,"living water, of which the Savior said to the Samaritan woman, ""whoever drinks of it will never thirst."" How right and true, as words coming from the mouth of Truth Itself, that such a person will not thirst for anything in this life -- although thirst for the things of the next life increases much more than can ever be imagined through natural thirst! How thirsty one becomes for this thirst! The soul understands the great value of this thirst, and even though the thirst is a most painful, wearying one, it brings with it the very satisfaction by which it is assuaged, in such a way that it is a thirst unquenchable except in earthly things. Indeed, this thirst slakes in such a way that when God satisfies the thirst, the greatest favor He can grant the soul is to leave in it this same need -- and a greater one -- to drink the water again.
3. Water has three properties that I now recall as applicable to our subject, for it must have many more. The first is that it refreshes; for, no matter how much heat we may experience, as soon as we approach the water the heat goes away. If there is a great fire, it is extinguished by water -- unless the fire burns from pitch; then it is enkindled more. Oh, God help me, what marvels there are in this greater enkindling of the fire by water when the fire is strong, powerful, and not subject to the elements. For this water doesn't impede the fire, though it is fire's contrary, but rather makes the fire increase! It would be a great help here to be able to speak with someone who knows philosophy, for in knowing the properties of things he would be able to explain to me what I enjoy thinking about but don't know how to speak of or even perhaps understand.
4. Those of you, Sisters, who drink this water and you others, once the Lord brings you to drink, will enjoy it and understand how the true love of God -- if it is strong, completely free of earthly things, and if it flies above them -- is lord of all the elements and of the world. And since water flows from the earth, don't fear that it will extinguish this fire of the love of God; such a thing does not lie within its power. Even though the two are contraries, this fire is absolute lord; it",0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,2,9,0,2,17,1,0,0,11,7,8,9,10,0,3,8,12,4,2,24
"77",1566,64,"isn't subject to water. Hence do not be surprised, Sisters, about the many things I have written in this book so that you might obtain this liberty. Isn't it wonderful that a poor nun of St. Joseph's can attain dominion over all the earth and the elements? No wonder the saints, with the help of God, were able to do with the elements whatever they wanted. Fire and water obeyed St. Martin; even the birds and the fish, St. Francis; and so it was with many other saints. There was clear evidence that they had dominion over all worldly things because they labored to take little account of them and were truly subject with all their strength to the Lord of the world. So, as I say, the water that rises from the earth has no power over the love of God; the flames of this love are very high, and the source of it is not found in anything so lowly.
There are other little fires of love of God that any event will extinguish. But extinguish this fire? No, not at all! Even though a whole sea of temptations comes, the fire will not be put out and thereby made to lose control over these temptations. [For with the help of God and doing what lies in their power, men can almost seek this love by right. Do you think that because the Psalmist says that all things are subject to man and put under his feet that it is so with all men? Not at all! On the contrary, I see many of them subject to and trampled upon by things. In fact, I knew a gentleman who was killed in a quarrel over a few dimes. What a miserable price he was subject to. There are many things you will see every day from which you will know that I am speaking the truth. If the psalmist couldn't lie -- for what he says is from the Holy Spirit -- it seems to me that the saying, ""they will rule over all earthly things,"" pertains to the perfect. It could be that I don't understand and am foolish, but I have read this.]
5. Well, if it is water that rains from heaven, so much less will it extinguish this fire; the two are not contraries but from the same land. Have no fear that the one element will do harm to the other; rather, they help each other produce their effect. For the water of",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,4,13,1,8,13,2,2,3,8,9,6,8,14,2,5,4,1,0,4,5
"78",1566,65,"true tears, those that flow in true prayer, readily given by the King of heaven, helps the fire burn more and last longer; and the fire helps the water bring refreshment. Oh, God help me, what a beautiful and marvelous thing, that fire makes one feel cooler! Yes, and it even freezes all worldly attachments when it is joined to the living water from heaven. Heaven is the source of the tears that were mentioned, for they are given and not acquired through our own efforts. Therefore, this living water will certainly not let the heat from worldly things detain the soul -- unless to allow the soul to communicate this fire to others. For by its nature this fire is not content with little; it would burn up the whole world if it could.
6. Another property of water is that it cleans dirty things. What would the world be like if there were no water for washing? Do you know how clean this water is, this heavenly water, this clear water, when it isn't cloudy, when it isn't muddy, but falls from heaven? Once this water has been drunk, I am certain that it leaves the soul bright and cleansed of all faults. Since this divine union is something very supernatural, it is not a matter of our own choosing. As I have written, God doesn't permit a soul to drink this water unless to cleanse it and leave it clean and free from all the mud and misery in which, through its own faults, it was struck. Other delights that come through the medium of the intellect, however much they may accomplish, come from water running on the ground; they do not come from drinking at the fount. There is never a lack of muddy things to detain one on this path, and the water is not so pure and clean. Living water is not what I call this prayer in which, as I say, there is reasoning with the intellect; I mean from the way I understand things. For something from the road that we don't want will stick to our soul and be helped to cling there by our body and natural lowliness, however much we may want to avoid this.
7. Let me explain myself further: suppose that in order to despise the world we are thinking about its nature and how all things come to an end. Almost without our realizing it we find ourselves thinking about the things we like in the",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,2,0,0,1,4,6,1,15,0,8,21,2,1,4,11,9,8,8,11,2,1,7,1,3,0,16
"79",1566,66,"world; and in desiring to flee them, we are at least hindered a little by thinking about how they were and how they will be and what we will do; in order to think of what we must do to free ourselves, we place ourselves in danger again. Not that this reasoning must be abandoned, but one must be fearful; it's necessary to proceed with care.
By means of this living water the Lord Himself takes up these cares, for He doesn't want to entrust them to us. He so esteems our soul that He doesn't allow it to be occupied with things that can harm it during the time He wishes to favor it. Rather, He immediately places it near Himself and shows it in an instant more truths, and gives it clearer understanding of what everything is, than we could have here below in many years. For our eyes don't see clearly; the dust blinds us as we walk. By this living water the Lord brings us to the end of the journey without our understanding how.
8. The other property of water is that it satisfies to the full and takes away thirst. To me it seems that thirst signifies the desire for something of which we are in great want, so that if the thing is completely lacking its absence will kill us. How strange that if water is lacking, this lack kills us; and if there is too much, we die, as is seen through the many who drown. O my Lord, and who will find himself so immersed in this living water that he will die! But, is this possible? Yes, because the love of God and desire for Him can increase so much that the natural subject is unable to endure it, and so there have been persons who have died from love. I know of one who would have died if God hadn't succored her immediately with such an abundance of this living water, for she was almost carried out of herself with raptures. I say that she was almost carried out of herself because in this water the soul finds rest. It seems that while she is drowning from not being able to endure the world, she is revived in God; and His Majesty enables her to enjoy what in herself she couldn't without dying.
9. It should be understood here that since there can be nothing imperfect in our supreme Good, everything He gives is for our good; and however great",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,8,9,7,14,1,3,1,12,9,21,10,9,4,1,0,3,5,2,9
"80",1566,67,"the abundance of this water He gives, there cannot be too much in anything of His. If He gives a great deal, He gives the soul, as I said, the capacity to drink much; like a glassmaker who makes the vessel a size he sees is necessary in order to hold what he intends to pour into it.
In desiring this water there is always some fault, since the desire comes from ourselves; if some good comes, it comes from the Lord who helps. But we are so indiscreet that since the pain is sweet and delightful, we never think we can have enough of this pain. We eat without measure, we foster this desire as much as we can, and so sometimes it kills. How fortunate such a death! But perhaps by continuing to live we can help others die of desire for this death. And I believe the devil causes this desire for death, for he understands the harm that can be done by such a person while alive; and so at this stage he tempts one to perform indiscreet penances so that one's health will be lost, which would be no small gain for the devil.
10. I say that anyone who reaches the experience of this thirst that is so impelling should be very careful because I believe he will have this temptation. And although he may not die of thirst, his health will be lost and he will give exterior manifestations of this thirst, even though he may not want to; these manifestations should be avoided at all costs. Sometimes our diligence is of little avail, for we will be unable to hide everything we would like to hide. But when these impulses that so greatly increase this desire to die come, we should be careful not to add to the desire, but gently cut the thread with another consideration. For our nature at times can be as much at work as the love; there are persons who will vehemently desire anything, even if it is bad. I don't believe these persons will be very mortified, for mortification helps in everything. It seems foolish to cut short something good; but it isn't. For I do not say that the desire is taken away, but that it is cut short, and perhaps by another desire as meritorious as the former.
11. I wish to say something in order to explain myself better: a great desire is given to see oneself with God and to be loosed from",3,5,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,1,5,8,15,16,1,4,2,7,7,21,17,6,2,4,1,3,5,1,7
"81",1566,68,"this prison, like the desire St. Paul had. Pain for a reason like this must in itself be very delightful; no small amount of mortification is needed to break it off, and one will be unable to do so completely. Sometimes the pain is seen to afflict so much that it almost takes away one's reason. Not long ago I saw a person of an impetuous nature who, even though she was experienced in going against her will -- I think she had already lost it, as was seen in other things -- was deranged for a while by the great pain and the effort that was made to conceal this pain. I hold that in so extreme a case, even though the experience may come from the Spirit of God, the humble thing is to be fearful, for we shouldn't think we have so much charity that it will put us in such straits.
12. If a person is able -- for perhaps he will not always be able -- I say that I wouldn't consider it wrong if he were to remove the desire by the thought that if he lives he will serve God more and enlighten some soul that would have been lost, and that by serving more he will merit the capacity to enjoy God more. And let him fear the little that he has served. These consoling thoughts are good for so great a work. His affliction will be mitigated, and he will gain very much. For in order to serve the Lord Himself, one should desire to suffer here below and live with the Lord's affliction. It's as when one has a great trial or a heavy sorrow; you comfort him by telling him to be patient and leave it in the hands of God and that the Lord's will is being done by it, for in every event the best we can do is leave ourselves in the hands of God.
13. It would be possible for the devil in some way to foster such a great desire. The account is given, I believe in Cassian, of a hermit who lived a most austere life. The devil made him think that by throwing himself into a well he would see God more quickly. I truly believe that this hermit could not have served with humility or goodness; for the Lord is faithful, and His Majesty would not consent that one be blinded in a matter so obvious. But clearly, if the desire",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,15,0,13,17,2,0,4,11,4,19,14,7,5,1,3,2,6,0,0
"82",1566,69,"were from God, it wouldn't cause any harm: such a desire bears light, discretion, and measure. But this adversary and enemy of ours tries to cause harm wherever he can; and since he doesn't go about carelessly, neither should we. This is an important point for many reasons. Thus the time of prayer should be shortened, however delightful the prayer may be, when it is seen that the bodily energies are failing or that the head might suffer harm. Discretion is very necessary in all.
14. Why do you think, daughters, that I have tried to explain the goal and show you the reward before the battle, by telling you about the good that comes from drinking of this heavenly fount, of this living water? So that you will not be dismayed by the trial and contradiction there is along the way, and advance with courage and not grow weary. For, as I have said, it can happen that after having arrived you will have nothing left to do but stoop and drink from the fount; and yet you will abandon everything and lose this good, thinking that you have not the strength to reach it and that you are not meant for it.
15. Behold, the Lord invites all. Since He is truth itself, there is no reason to doubt. If this invitation were not a general one, the Lord wouldn't have called us all, and even if He called all, He wouldn't have promised, ""I will give you to drink."" He could have said, ""Come all of you, for in the end you won't lose anything, and to those whom I choose I will give to drink."" But since He spoke without this condition to all, I hold as certain that all those who do not falter on the way will drink this living water. May the Lord, because of who He is, give us the grace to seek this living water as it should be sought, for He promises it.

CHAPTER 20
 
How in different ways consolation is never lacking on the path of prayer. Counsels the Sisters to let their conversations deal always with prayer.
 
1. It seems I contradicted in the previous chapter what I had said before. When I was consoling those who were not contemplatives, I said that the Lord had different paths by which to go to Him just as there are many dwelling places. So I repeat it now. Since His Majesty has understood our weakness, He has provided after the manner",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,0,10,0,18,14,2,4,5,10,12,11,10,13,1,5,0,2,5,0,8
"83",1566,70,"of who He is. But He did not say: ""some come by this path, and others by another."" Rather, His mercy was so great He excluded no one from striving to come to this fount of life to drink. May He be blessed forever! And how rightly might He have excluded me!
2. Now, since He didn't stop me when I started to walk along this path, nor order me to be thrown into the abyss, surely He excludes no one; rather, He calls us publicly, crying aloud. But since He is so good, He does not force us; on the contrary, in many ways He gives drink to those who wish to follow Him so that no one will go without consolation or die of thirst. Rivers stream from this overflowing fount, some large, others small; and sometimes little pools for children -- for that is enough for them, and moreover it would frighten them to see a lot of water. These children are the ones who are at the beginning. So, Sisters, do not fear that you will die of thirst on this road. Never is the lack of consoling water such that it cannot be endured. Since this is so, take my advice and do not stop on the road but, like the strong, fight even to death in the search, for you are not here for any other reason than to fight. You must always proceed with this determination to die rather than fail to reach the end of the journey. If even though you so proceed, the Lord should lead you in such a way that you are left with some thirst in this life, in the life that lasts forever He will give you to drink in great plenty and you will have no fear of being without water. May it please the Lord that we ourselves do not fail, amen.
3. Now, that you might so walk along this path of prayer that you do not go astray at the beginning, let us deal a little with how this journey must begin; for the beginning is the more important part -- indeed it is the most important part for everything. I don't say that if a person doesn't have the determination of which I shall speak here, he should stop trying; for the Lord will continue perfecting him. And if that person should do no more than take one step, the step will contain in itself so much power that he will not",4,4,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,7,4,8,13,3,2,3,3,8,14,15,10,1,3,0,3,3,0,9
"84",1566,71,"have to fear losing it, nor will he fail to be very well paid.
This situation can be compared to that of a person who uses beads to count indulgenced prayers. If he uses them once, he gains the indulgences; if he uses them more often, he gains more; but if he never uses them, keeping them rather in a chest, it would be better for him not to have them. So it is here: even though afterward a person may not continue on the same road, the little progress he may have made on it will have provided him with light so that he may walk well on other paths; and the greater the progress, the more light. In sum, even if later he gives up, he may be certain that it will not have done him any harm to have begun; for good never produces evil.
Thus, daughters, in reference to all the persons who speak with you, if they are disposed and there is some friendship, try to remove any fear they may have of beginning to use so great a good. And for the love of God I beg you that your conversation always be directed toward bringing some good to the one with whom you are speaking, for your prayer must be for the benefit of souls. And since the good of souls is what you must always beg the Lord for, it would seem wrong, Sisters, if you did not strive for this in every way.
4. If you want to be a good relative, this desire to be of benefit to the relative is where true friendship lies; if you want to be a good friend, know that you cannot be one save by this path. Let truth dwell in your hearts, as it should through meditation, and you will see clearly the kind of love we are obliged to have for our neighbor.
There's no longer time, Sisters, for children's games, for these worldly friendships, even though they may be good, seem to be nothing else. Unless there is a very good reason and it is for the benefit of that soul, don't let your conversation be of the sort in which you ask, ""Do you like me?"" or ""Don't you like me?"" It can happen that in order that your relative or brother or a similar person listen to a truth you want to point out and admit it you will have to dispose him by means of these words and demonstrations of",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,9,0,9,28,3,2,2,7,10,18,25,13,1,3,0,2,0,2,0
"85",1566,72,"love that are always pleasing to sensuality. It will happen that a good word, as these are called, will do more and dispose one more than will many about God so that afterward these latter may be accepted. And thus if you use them knowingly for the benefit of others, I do not forbid them. But if they are not used for this reason, they will be of no avail and may do harm without your realizing it. Others already know that you are religious and that your business is prayer. Don't think to yourself that you don't want them to consider you good, for what they see in you is to the benefit or harm of all. And it is a serious wrong for those who have so great an obligation to speak of God, as do nuns, to think that it is good for them to hide their feelings about God; although they may be allowed to do this sometimes for a greater good. God is your business and language. Whoever wants to speak to you must learn this language; and if he doesn't, be on your guard that you don't learn his; it will be a hell.
5. If they should think you're unsophisticated, what does it matter? If they take you for hypocrites, it matters even less. You will gain in that no one will want to see you except the one who understands this language. There wouldn't be much reason for anyone who doesn't know Arabic to enjoy speaking a great deal with one who knows only that language. And so, neither will they make you weary or do you harm, for to begin to speak a new language would cause no small amount of harm, and all your time would be spent in learning it. And you cannot know as I do, for I have experience of it, the great evil this new language is for the soul; in order to know the one, the other is forgotten. The new language involves a constant disturbance from which you ought to flee at all costs, for what is very suited to this path that we are beginning to discuss is peace and tranquility of soul.
6. If those who speak with you wish to learn your language, though it is not your business to teach anyone, you can tell about the riches that are gained in learning it since telling of this is beneficial to the other, and when he learns about the great gain",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,0,6,10,0,10,18,1,2,0,21,9,16,14,5,2,5,1,0,1,1,0
"86",1566,73,"that is to be had, he may go and seek out a master who will teach him. It would be no small favor from the Lord if you were to succeed in awakening some soul to this good.
But how many things come to mind in beginning to discuss this path, even to the mind of one who has walked it as poorly as I. [Would that I had many hands with which to write so that while putting down some of these things I wouldn't forget the others.] May the Lord be pleased, Sisters, that I know how to speak of it better than I have practiced it, amen.

CHAPTER 21
 
Tells how important it is to begin the practice of prayer with great determination and not to pay attention to obstacles set up by the devil.
 
1. Do not be frightened, daughters, by the many things you need to consider in order to begin this divine journey which is the royal road to heaven. A great treasure is gained by traveling this road; no wonder we have to pay what seems to us a high price. The time will come when you will understand how trifling everything is next to so precious a reward.
2. Now returning to those who want to journey on this road and continue until they reach the end, which is to drink from this water of life. I say that how they are to begin is very important -- in fact, all important. They must have a great and very resolute determination to persevere until reaching the end, come what may, happen what may, whatever work is involved, whatever criticism arises, whether they arrive or whether they die on the road, or even if they don't have courage for the trials that are met, or if the whole world collapses. You will hear some persons frequently making objections: ""there are dangers""; ""so-and-so went astray by such means""; ""this other one was deceived""; ""another who prayed a great deal fell away""; ""it's harmful to virtue""; ""it's not for women, for they will be susceptible to illusions""; ""it's better they stick to their sewing""; ""they don't need these delicacies""; ""the Our Father and the Hail Mary are sufficient.""
3. This last statement, Sisters, I agree with. And indeed they are sufficient! It is always good to base your prayer on prayers coming from the mouth of the Lord. In this matter those who warn us are right, for if our nature were not so weak and our",1,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,6,2,0,4,12,1,6,24,1,2,0,11,6,11,16,6,0,3,1,2,2,0,2
"87",1566,74,"devotion so lukewarm there wouldn't be any need to compose other prayers, nor would there be need for other books. As I say, I am speaking to souls that cannot recollect their minds in the thought of other mysteries because they think some kind of skill is needed, and there are some minds so ingenious that they're never satisfied with any of their thoughts. So it seems to me now that I should proceed by setting down some points here about the beginning, the means, and the end of prayer. I shall not take time to dwell on more sublime things. No one will be able to take from you these books (the Our Father and the Hail Mary), and if you are eager to learn you won't need anything else provided you are humble. I have always been fond of the words of the Gospels [that have come from that most sacred mouth in the way they were said] and found more recollection in them than in very cleverly written books. I especially had no desire to read these books if the author was not well approved. If, then, I draw near to this Master of wisdom, He will perhaps teach me some worthwhile thoughts that will please you.
I don't say that I'm going to write a commentary on these divine prayers, for I wouldn't dare. Many commentaries have been written; and even if they hadn't been, it would be absurd for me to write one. But I will mention some thoughts on the words of the Our Father. For sometimes, with regard to many books, it seems we lose devotion in the very exercise in which it is so important for us to have devotion. Clearly, when a master teaches something he gets to love his disciple and is pleased if that which he teaches satisfies his pupil, and he helps him a great deal to learn the material. The heavenly Master will do the same with us.
5. Hence, don't pay any attention to the fears they raise or to the picture of the dangers they paint for you. Wouldn't it be nice if while desiring to procure a great treasure I should want to walk without danger along a path where there are so many robbers. It would be a pleasant world if they would let you get the treasure in peace. But for a penny's worth of self-interest they will go many nights without sleep and disturb you in body and soul. For when",5,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,12,7,0,2,9,0,6,25,3,2,1,14,2,23,24,3,1,4,0,3,1,1,0
"88",1566,75,"you are about to gain the treasure -- or steal it, since the Lord says that the violent take it away -- by a royal road and by a safe road, the road chosen by our King and all His elect and saints, they will tell you that there are so many dangers and so many things to fear. How many more dangers are there for those who think they obtain this good without following a road?
6. Oh, my daughters! There are incomparably more dangers for such persons, but people don't know about them until they bump blindly into the true danger when there is no one to give them a hand; and they lose the water entirely without drinking either little or much -- neither from a small pool nor from a stream.
So you see, how will one journey without a drop of this water on a road where there are so many struggles? It is clear that when it is needed most they will not have it and will die of thirst. Because whether we like it or not, my daughters, we must all journey toward this fount, even though in different ways. Well, believe me; and don't let anyone deceive you by showing you a road other than that of prayer.
7. I am not speaking now about whether the prayer should be mental or vocal for everyone. In your case, I say that you need both. Such is the duty of religious. Should anyone tell you that prayer is dangerous, consider him the real danger and run from him. Don't forget this counsel, for perhaps you will need it. There will be danger in not having humility and the other virtues. But that the way of prayer be a way of danger -- God would never will that. It seems the devil has invented these fears, and so he has been skillful, apparently, in making some who have practiced prayer fall away.
8. And see how blind the world is, for they fail to consider the many thousands who have fallen into heresies and great evils because they didn't practice prayer but engaged in distractions. And if in order to carry on his work better the devil has caused, among this multitude of persons, some of those who practiced prayer to fall, he has caused as much fear in others about virtuous things. Those who take this reasoning as a refuge in order to free themselves should be on their guard, for they are running away",2,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,1,13,1,20,12,5,10,2,7,10,9,13,8,4,3,1,2,2,0,4
"89",1566,76,"from good in order to free themselves from evil. Never have I seen such a wicked contrivance; it really seems to come from the devil. O my Lord, defend Yourself! See how they understand Your words in reverse. Don't permit such weaknesses in Your servants. [Hold fast, daughters, for they cannot take from you the Our Father and the Hail Mary.]
9. There's one great blessing: you will always find some who will help you, because this is a characteristic of the real servant of God to whom His Majesty has given light concerning the true way; in the midst of these fears the desire not to give up increases within him. He understands clearly where the devil is going to strike, flees from him and crushes his head. The devil feels more regret over this than he does satisfaction over the many pleasures that others give them. In a time of disturbance, of discord caused by the devil -- for it seems all are following him half blind because they do so under the guise of zeal -- God will raise up someone to open the eyes of these half-blind people and tell them that the devil has placed a cloud in front of them to prevent their seeing the way. Oh, the greatness of God, for sometimes one or two men alone can do more when they speak the truth than many together! Little by little, souls discover again the way; God gives them courage. If they are told there is danger in prayer, one of these servants of God will strive, if not in words then in deeds, to make known how good prayer is. If they are told that frequent Communion is not good, he will receive more frequently. Thus, since there are one or two who fearlessly do what is best, the Lord at once begins to win back gradually the ground that was lost.
10. Therefore, Sisters, give up these fears; never pay attention in like matters to the opinion of the crowd. Behold, these are not the times to believe everyone; believe only those who you see are walking in conformity with Christ's life. Try to preserve a pure conscience, humility, and contempt for all worldly things; believe firmly what Holy Mother Church holds, and you can be sure you will be walking along a good path.
Leave aside, as I said, your fears where there is no reason for fear. If someone should raise these fears to you, humbly explain the path to",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,18,0,19,17,6,4,3,14,11,7,13,11,6,2,1,2,3,0,0
"90",1566,77,"him. Tell him you have a rule that commands you to pray unceasingly -- for that's what it commands us -- and that you have to keep it. If they tell you that the prayer should be vocal, ask, for the sake of more precision, if in vocal prayer the mind and heart must be attentive to what you say. If they answer ""yes"" -- for they cannot answer otherwise -- you will see how they admit that you are forced to practice mental prayer and even experience contemplation if God should give it to you by such a means. So great was her thirst, so much was her desire increasing that she understood dearly it would have been possible to die of love if the raptures hadn't soothed the thirst. Blessed be He who in His Gospel invites us to drink! Thus, since in our Lord and our Good there cannot be anything imperfect, He gives us what we need; it belongs to Him alone to give us this water. and although I have read in some books, and even in several, how good it is to begin with such an attitude, nothing will be lost, in my opinion, by mentioning it here. CHAPTER 22
 
Explains what mental prayer is.
 
1. Realize, daughters, that the nature of mental prayer isn't determined by whether or not the mouth is closed. If while speaking I thoroughly understand and know that I am speaking with God and I have greater awareness of this than I do of the words I'm saying, mental and vocal prayer are joined. If, however, others tell you that you are speaking with God while you are reciting the Our Father and at the same time in fact thinking of the world, then I have nothing to say. But if you are to be speaking, as is right, with so great a Lord, it is good that you consider whom you are speaking with as well as who you are, at least if you want to be polite. How can you call the king ""your highness"" or know the ceremonies to be observed in addressing a highest ranking nobleman if you do not clearly understand what his position is and what your is? For it is in conformity with these facts that you must show respect, and in conformity with custom -- because you also need to know even the customs. If you don't know them, you will be sent away as a simpleton and will",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,14,1,2,11,0,0,2,19,7,20,17,6,1,8,0,4,0,1,4
"91",1566,78,"fail to negotiate anything. [And what's more, if you don't know these things well, you will need to find out and even rehearse what you must say. Once it happened to me that, not having been accustomed to speaking with lords and ladies I had to speak with someone who was to be addressed as your ladyship; and so they had to show me how to say it. Since I am dull and was not used to these titles, I didn't get it right when the time came. I decided to tell her what happened and, laughing at myself, asked her to allow me to address her with the ordinary form ""you;"" and so I did.]
Well, what is this, my Lord? What is this, my Emperor? How can it be tolerated? You are King forever, my God; Your kingdom is not a borrowed one. When in the Creed the words, ""and His kingdom will have no end,"" are said, it is almost always a special delight for me. I praise You, Lord, and bless You forever; in sum, Your kingdom will last forever. Well then, may You never permit, Lord, that anyone who is about to speak to You consider it good to do so only vocally.
2. What is this, Christians, that you say mental prayer isn't necessary? Do you understand yourselves? Indeed, I don't think you do, and so you desire that we all be misled. You don't know what mental prayer is, or how vocal prayer should be recited, or what contemplation is, for if you did you wouldn't on the on hand condemn what on the other hand you praise.
3. I shall always have to join mental prayer to vocal prayer -- when I remember -- so that others don't frighten you, daughters. I know how this criticism of mental prayer will end up, for I have suffered some trials in this matter, and thus I wouldn't want anyone to disturb you. It is harmful to walk on this road with fear. It is very important for you to know that you are on the right road. When a traveler is told that he has made a mistake and lost his way, he is made to go from one end to another, and all his searching for the way tires him, and he wastes time and arrives late.
Who can say that it is wrong, when we begin to recite the Hours or the rosary, to consider whom we are going to speak with, and who",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,16,0,11,11,3,1,4,12,12,10,12,11,0,9,2,2,1,0,0
"92",1566,79,"we are, so as to know how to speak with Him? Now I tell you, Sisters, if before you begin your vocal prayer you do the great deal that must be done in order to understand these two points well, you will be spending a good amount of time in mental prayer. Yes, indeed, for we must not approach a conversation with a prince as negligently as we do one with a farm worker, or with some poor thing like ourselves for whom any manner of address is all right.
4. It is only right that we consider these two points since, because of his humility, this King listens to me and lets me approach Him; and His guards do not throw me out, even though as an uneducated person I don't know how to speak to Him. The angels who assist Him know well the attitude of their King, for He delights more in the unpolished manners of a humble shepherd who He realizes would say more if he knew more than He does in the talk of very wise and learned men, however elegant their discourse, if they don't walk in humility. But just because He is good doesn't mean that we should be rude. At least, in order to thank Him for the bad odor He must endure in consenting to allow one like myself to come near Him, we should strive to be aware of His purity and of who He is. It's true that upon approaching Him one understands immediately, just as with lords here below; for when they tell us who their father was and about the millions they get in rent and of their title of dignity, there's no more to know. In fact, here below people in paying honor don't take into account the persons themselves, however much these persons may deserve the honor, but their wealth.
5. O miserable world! Praise God very much, daughters, because you have left something so wretched, where men pay attention not to what they have within themselves but to what their tenant farmers and vassals have; and if these men lack subordinates then no honor is paid them. It's something amusing to relax over when you all have to take some recreation. For this is a good pastime: to notice how blindly those who are in the world spend their time.
6. Oh, our Emperor, supreme Power, supreme Goodness, Wisdom itself, without beginning, without end, without any limit to Your works; they are infinite and incomprehensible,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,3,9,6,0,3,25,1,1,1,14,8,11,12,8,1,4,0,0,1,0,0
"93",1566,80,"a fathomless sea of marvels, with a beauty containing all beauty, strength itself! Oh, God help me, who might possess here all human eloquence and wisdom together in order to know how to explain clearly -- insofar as is possible here below, because in this case all knowledge is equivalent to knowing nothing -- a number of the many things we can consider in order to have some knowledge of who this Lord and Good of ours is!
7. Yes, bring yourselves to consider and understand whom you are speaking with, or, as you approach, with whom you are about to speak. In a thousand lives we would never completely understand the way in which this Lord deserves that we speak with Him, for the angels tremble before Him. He commands all; He can do all; for Him, to will is to do. Well then, it is only right, daughters, that we try to delight in these grandeurs our Spouse possesses and that we understand whom we are wedded to and what kind of life we must live. Oh, God help me, here below before getting married a person will know the other party, who he is and what he possesses. We are already betrothed and before the wedding must be brought to His house. Here below they don't try to make those who are betrothed renounce such thoughts. Why should they try to prevent us from thinking about who this man is, who His Father is, what country He is going to bring me to, what good things He promises to give me, what His status is, how I can make Him happy, and in what ways I can please Him, and from studying how I can conform my way of life to His? Now if a woman is to be happily married, she must, according to the advice she receives, strive for this conformity even though her husband is a man of lowly estate.
8. Well, my Spouse, must they in everything pay less attention to You than to men? If paying more attention to You doesn't seem right to them, let them at least leave Your brides alone, for these latter must live their lives with You. Indeed, their life is a good one. If a spouse is so jealous that he doesn't want his bride to talk to anyone, it would be a fine thing if she didn't think about how she might please him in this matter and the reason she has for putting up",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,2,5,0,5,18,1,1,2,18,9,13,11,15,2,3,0,0,4,0,0
"94",1566,81,"with this jealousy and for wanting to avoid speaking with another since in him she has all that she could want!
This is mental prayer, my daughters: to understand these truths. If you should want to grow in understanding these things and pray vocally, well and good. You should not be thinking of other things while speaking with God, for doing so amounts to not knowing what mental prayer is. I believe the matter has been explained. May it please the Lord that we know how to put it into practice. Amen.

CHAPTER 23
 
Treats of how important it is for one who has begun the path of prayer not to turn back and speaks once more of the great value that lies in beginning with determination.
 
1. Well now, I say there are so many reasons why it is extremely important to begin with great determination that I would have to go on at much length if I mentioned them all. Sisters, I want to mention only two or three.
One is that if we resolve to give something, that is, this little care, to someone who has given so much to us and continually gives -- giving this little care is certainly to our advantage and we thereby gain so many wonderful things -- there is no reason for failing to give with complete determination. There's no reason for being like the lender who gives something with the intention of getting it back again. Lending doesn't seem to me to amount to giving; rather, there is always some displeasure felt by the borrower when the object is taken back, especially if he needs it and has already used it as his own, or if the lender is his friend, or if the borrower has given the lender many gifts without any self-seeking. The borrower would rightly think there was very little love in the lender who won't even let him keep a little thing, not even as a sign of love.
2. What bride is there who in receiving many valuable jewels from her bridegroom will refuse to give him even a ring, not because of what it is worth, for everything belongs to him, but to give it as a pledge that she will be his until death? Does this Lord deserve less, that we should we mock Him by giving and then taking back the trifle that we gave Him? But this little bit of time that we resolve to give Him, which we spend on ourselves and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,8,1,5,28,1,3,1,18,10,18,16,8,0,5,1,0,0,2,0
"95",1566,82,"on someone who will not thank us for it, let us give to Him, since we desire to do so, with our thoughts free of other things and unoccupied by them. And let us be wholly determined never to take it back from Him, neither because of trials on this account, for because of contradictions, nor because of dryness. I should consider the time of prayer as not belonging to me and think that He can ask it of me in justice when I do not want to give it wholly to Him.
3. In saying ""wholly,"" I do not mean that abandoning it for a day or for a few days on account of some just occupations or because of some indisposition is the equivalent of taking it back. Let the intention be firm; my God is not at all touchy; He doesn't bother about trifling things. Thus you will have something to be grateful for; this intention amounts to giving something. As for others, for anyone who is not generous but so stingy that he doesn't have the spirit of giving, it is enough for them to lend. In the end, one who lends does do something, and this Lord of ours takes everything into account. He adjusts Himself to our way of giving. In taking account of us, He is not at all petty, but generous. However great our debt may be, He finds it easy to pardon; but when there is a question of His repaying us, He's so careful that you need have no fear. Just the raising of our eyes in remembrance of Him will have its reward.
4. Another reason for beginning with determination is that the devil will not then have so free a hand to tempt. He's extremely afraid of determined souls, for he has experienced the great harm they do him. And all the harm he plans to do them turns out to their benefit and to that of others as well; and he comes out with a loss. But we should not be careless or trust in this fact, for we are dealing with traitors, and they don't dare attack so often those who are well prepared; they are very cowardly. But if the devil should see carelessness, he would do great harm. And if he knows that someone is changeable and unstable in being good and not strongly determined to persevere, he will keep after him day and night; he will cause fears and never-ending obstacles. I know",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,7,7,0,16,25,3,4,2,15,10,9,16,10,2,1,3,2,0,0,0
"96",1566,83,"this very well through experience, and that's why I'm able to say, and do say, that no one knows how important determination is.
5. The other reason for beginning with determination is -- and it is very much to the point -- that the person who does so struggles more courageously. He knows that come what may he will not turn back. As in the case of one who is in a battle, he knows that if he is conquered they won't spare him his life and that if he doesn't die in battle he will die afterward. He struggles with greater determination and wants to fight like a desperado -- as they say -- and he doesn't fear the blows so much, because he is convinced of how important victory is and that for him to conquer is to live. It's also necessary to begin with the assurance that if we don't let ourselves be conquered we will obtain our goal; this without a doubt, for no matter how small the gain, one will end up being very rich. Don't be afraid that the Lord will leave you to die of thirst, for He calls us to drink from this fount. I have already said this and would like to say it many times, for the devil intimidates persons who don't yet fully know the goodness of the Lord through experience, even though they know it through faith. But it is a great thing to have experienced the friendship and favor He shows toward those who journey on this road and how He takes care of almost all the expenses.
6. I'm not surprised that those who have not experienced this want the assurance of some gain for themselves. Well, you already know there is the hundredfold even in this life and that the Lord says, ""ask, and you will receive."" If you don't believe His Majesty in the sections of His gospel that insure this gain, it will be of little benefit, Sisters, for me to break my head in trying to tell you about it. Nevertheless, I say that should anyone have some doubt little would be lost in trying the journey of prayer; for this journey brings with it the following good: more is given than is asked for, beyond what we could desire. This is absolutely true; I know. And those of you who know it by experience, through the goodness of God, can be my witnesses.

CHAPTER 24
 
How vocal prayer must be recited with",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,2,9,3,12,25,6,4,1,13,8,12,11,7,0,7,0,2,2,0,2
"97",1566,84,"perfection, and mental prayer joined with it.
 
1. Now, then, let us speak again to those souls I mentioned that cannot recollect or tie their minds down in mental prayer or engage in reflection. Let's not mention here by name these two things, since you are not meant to follow such a path. As a matter of fact there are many persons seemingly terrified by the mere term ""mental prayer"" or ""contemplation,"" and perhaps one of these might come to this house, for as I have also said not everyone walks by the same path.
2. Well what I now want to counsel you about (I can even say teach you, because as a Mother, having the office of prioress, I'm allowed to teach) is how you must pray vocally, for it's only right that you should understand what you're saying. And because it can happen that those who are unable to think about God may also find long prayers tiring, I don't want to concern myself with these. But I will speak of those prayers we are obliged as Christians to recite (such as, the Our Father and the Hail Mary) so that people won't be able to say of us that we speak and don't understand what we're speaking about -- unless we think it is enough for us to follow the practice in which merely pronouncing the words is sufficient. I'm not concerned with whether this is sufficient or not; learned men will explain [the matter to those persons to whom God gives light to ask the question. And I'm not meddling with what doesn't belong to our state.] What I would like us to do, daughters, is refuse to be satisfied with merely pronouncing the words. For when I say, ""I believe,"" it seems to me right that I should know and understand what I believe. And when I say, ""Our Father,"" it will be an act of love to understand who this Father of ours is and who the Master is who taught us this prayer.
3. If you reply that you already know this and that there is no reason to recall it, you are wrong. There is a large difference in teachers; but it is even a great misfortune if we forget those who teach us here below. Especially, if they are saints and spiritual masters and we are good disciples, it is impossible to forget them [but we love them very much and even take pride in them and often speak to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,1,0,13,0,2,10,1,0,0,22,6,10,14,3,0,11,0,0,1,2,0
"98",1566,85,"them.] Well, God never allows us to forget the Master who taught us this prayer, and with so much love and desire that it benefit us. He wants us to remember Him often when we say the prayer, even though because of our weakness we do not remember him always.
4. Now with regard to vocal prayer you already know that His Majesty teaches that it be recited in solitude. This is what He always did when He prayed, and not out of any need of His own but for our instruction. It has already been mentioned that one cannot speak simultaneously to God and to the world; this would amount to nothing more than reciting the prayer while listening to what is being said elsewhere or to letting the mind wander and making no effort to control it. There can be exceptions at times either because of bad humors -- especially if the person is melancholic -- or because of faint feelings in the head so that all efforts become useless. Or it can happen that God will permit days of severe temptation in his servants for their greater good. And though in their affliction they are striving to be quiet, they cannot even be attentive to what they are saying, no matter how hard they try; nor will the intellect settle down in anything, but by the disordered way it goes about, it will seem to be in a frenzy.
5. Whoever experiences the affliction these distractions cause will see that they are not his fault; he should not grow anxious, which makes things worse, or tire himself trying to put order into something that at the time doesn't have any, that is, his mind. He should just pray as best he can; or even not pray, but like a sick person strive to bring some relief to his soul; let him occupy himself in other works of virtue. This advice now is for persons who are careful and who have understood that they must not speak simultaneously to both God and the world.
What we ourselves can do is to strive to be alone; and please God it will suffice, as I say, that we understand to whom we are speaking and the answer the Lord makes to our petitions. Do you think He is silent? Even though we do not hear Him, He speaks well to the heart when we beseech Him from the heart.
And it is good for us to consider that He taught this prayer",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,15,0,10,14,2,0,3,12,11,8,13,5,1,12,2,3,4,1,0
"99",1566,86,"to each of us and that He is showing it to us; the teacher is never so far from his pupil that he has to shout, but he is very close. I want you to understand that it is good for you, if you are to recite the Our Father well, to remain at the side of the Master who taught this prayer to you.
6. You will say that doing so involves reflection and that you neither can nor want to pray any other way but vocally; for there are also impatient persons who like to avoid any suffering. Since such individuals do not have the habit, it is difficult for them to recollect their minds in the beginning; and so as to avoid a little fatigue, they say they neither can nor know how to do anything else than pray vocally.
You are right in saying that this vocal prayer is now in fact mental prayer. But I tell you that surely I don't know how mental prayer can be separated from vocal prayer if the vocal prayer is to be recited well with an understanding of whom we are speaking to. It is even an obligation that we strive to pray with attention. Please God that with these remedies we shall recite the Our Father well and not end up in some other irrelevant thing. I have experienced this sometimes, and the best remedy I find is to strive to center the mind upon the one to whom the words are addressed. So, be patient and strive to make a habit out of something that is so necessary [if you are to be good nuns, and even pray as good Christians, in my opinion.] For, though being what I am, I would like to shout and argue with those who say mental prayer is not necessary. Don't let anyone frighten you with these fears. Praise God, for He is all powerful and will not let them take mental prayer away from you. On the contrary, anyone who cannot pray vocally with this attention should realize that he isn't fulfilling his obligation. He must strive for this attention with every effort -- if he wants to pray with perfection -- under pain of not doing what is required of the bride of so great a King. Beg Him, daughters, to give me the grace to do what I am counseling you to do, for I fail very much in this matter. May His Majesty provide because of who",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,19,0,11,15,5,1,3,11,5,10,14,9,0,7,0,0,2,0,0
"100",1566,87,"He is. This is absolutely true; I know it is so. If they don't find this is true, they shouldn't believe me in anything I say. Sisters, you already know it through experience; and, through the goodness of God, I can present you as witnesses. What has been said is good for those who are to come."" CHAPTER 25
 
Tells how much the soul gains through a perfect recitation of vocal prayer and how God happens to raise it from this prayer to supernatural things.
 
1. To keep you from thinking that little is gained through a perfect recitation of vocal prayer, I tell you that it is very possible that while you are reciting the Our Father or some other vocal prayer, the Lord may raise you to perfect contemplation. By these means His Majesty shows that He listens to the one who speaks to Him. And it is His grandeur that speaks to the soul, suspending one's intellect, binding one's imagination, and, as they say, taking the words from one's mouth; for even though the soul may want to do so, it cannot speak unless with great difficulty.
2. The soul understands that without the noise of words this divine Master is teaching it by suspending its faculties, for if they were to be at work they would do harm rather than bring benefit. They are enjoying without understanding how they are enjoying. The soul is being enkindled in love, and it doesn't understand how it loves. It knows that it enjoys what it loves, but it doesn't know how. It clearly understands that this joy is not a joy the intellect obtains merely through desire. The will is enkindled without understanding how. But as soon as it can understand something, it sees that this good cannot be merited or gained through all the trials one can suffer on earth. This good is a gift from the Lord of earth and heaven, who, in sum, gives according to who He is. What I have described, daughters, is perfect contemplation.
3. Now you will understand the difference that lies between perfect contemplation and mental prayer. Mental prayer consists of what was explained: being aware and knowing that we are speaking, with whom we are speaking, and who we ourselves are who dare to speak so much with so great a Lord. To think about this and other similar things, of how little we have served Him and how much we are obliged to serve Him, is mental prayer. Don't",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,19,0,4,28,0,1,1,23,8,7,10,10,1,11,0,1,0,3,0
"101",1566,88,"think it amounts to some other kind of gibberish, and don't let the name frighten you.
To recite the Our Father or the Hail Mary or whatever prayer you wish is vocal prayer. But behold what poor music you produce when you do this without mental prayer. Even the words will be poorly pronounced at times. In these two kinds of prayer we can do something ourselves, with the help of God. In the contemplation I now mentioned, we can do nothing; His Majesty is the one who does everything, for it is His work and above our nature.
4. Since I explained contemplation very much at length and as best I could in the account of my life that I said I wrote for my confessors -- for they had ordered me to write that account -- I will not speak of contemplation here or do any more than touch upon it. Those of you who have been so fortunate as to be brought by the Lord to the state of contemplation may, if you can get that account, find there some advice and counsel which God granted that I be able to give; it will be very consoling and beneficial to you. This is what I think, and so do some of those who have seen it -- for they have the account in order to make a judgment about it. What shame I feel in telling you that you should pay attention to something I have done, and the Lord knows the embarrassment with which I write much of what I write. May He be blessed for so putting up with me! Those of you who, as I say, experience supernatural prayer may obtain that account after my death; those of you who do not, need not worry about obtaining it but only about striving after what is contained in this present book and leave the rest to God; for it is He who must bestow supernatural prayer, and He will grant it to you if you do not stop short on the road but try hard until you reach the end.

CHAPTER 26
 
Explains a method for recollecting one's mind. Sets down some ways of doing this. The chapter is very useful for beginners in prayer.
 
1. Now then let us return to our vocal prayer that it may be so recited that, without our being aware of the fact, God may grant us everything together and also enable us to say vocal prayers as we should,",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,8,18,1,4,4,4,0,0,15,3,8,17,4,1,5,3,0,1,0,0
"102",1566,89,"as I have mentioned.
As is already known, the examination of conscience, the act of contrition, and the sign of the cross must come first. Then, daughters, since you are alone, strive to find a companion. Well what better companion than the Master Himself who taught you this prayer? Represent the Lord Himself as close to you and behold how lovingly and humbly He is teaching you. Believe me, you should remain with so good a friend as long as you can. If you grow accustomed to having Him present at your side, and He sees that you do so with love and that you go about striving to please Him, you will not be able -- as they say -- to get away from Him; He will never fail you; He will help you in all your trials; you will find Him everywhere. Do you think it's some small matter to have a friend like this at your side?
2. O Sisters, those of you who cannot engage in much discursive reflection with the intellect or keep your mind from distraction, get used to this practice! Get used to it! See, I know that you can do this; for I suffered many years from the trial -- and it is a very great one -- of not being able to quiet the mind in anything. But I know that the Lord does not leave us so abandoned; for if we humbly ask Him for this friendship, He will not deny it to us. And if we cannot succeed in one year, we will succeed later. Let's not regret the time that is so well spent. Who's making us hurry? I am speaking of acquiring this habit and of striving to walk alongside this true Master.
3. I'm not asking you now that you think about Him or that you draw out a lot of concepts or make long and subtle reflections with your intellect. I'm not asking you to do anything more than look at Him. For who can keep you from turning the eyes of your soul toward this Lord, even if you do so just for a moment if you can't do more? You can look at very ugly things; won't you be able to look at the most beautiful thing imaginable? Well now, daughters, your Spouse never takes His eyes off you. He has suffered your committing a thousand ugly offenses and abominations against Him, and this suffering wasn't enough for Him to cease looking at you.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,5,0,11,20,1,3,7,12,6,8,13,6,9,3,0,2,0,1,0
"103",1566,90,"Is it too much to ask you to turn your eyes from these exterior things in order to look at Him sometimes? Behold, He is not waiting for anything else, as He says to the bride, than that we look at Him. In the measure you desire Him, you will find Him. He so esteems our turning to look at Him that no diligence will be lacking on His part.
4. They say that for a woman to be a good wife toward her husband she must be sad when he is sad, and joyful when he is joyful, even though she may not be so. (See what subjection you have been freed from, Sisters!) The Lord, without deception, truly acts in such a way with us. He is the one who submits, and He wants you to be the lady with authority to rule; He submits to your will. If you are joyful, look at Him as risen. Just imagining how He rose from the tomb will bring you joy. The brilliance! The beauty! The majesty! How victorious! How joyful! Indeed, like one coming forth from a battle where he has gained a great kingdom! And all of that, plus Himself, He desires for you. Well, is it such a big thing that from time to time you turn your eyes to look upon one who gives you so much?
5. If you are experiencing trials or are sad, behold Him on the way to the garden: what great affliction He bore in His soul; for having become suffering itself, He tells us about it and complains of it. Or behold Him bound to the column, filled with pain, with all His flesh torn in pieces for the great love He bears you; so much suffering, persecuted by some. spit on by others, denied by His friends, abandoned by them, with no one to defend Him, frozen from the cold, left so alone that you can console each other. Or behold Him burdened with the cross, for they didn't even let Him take a breath. He will look at you with those eyes so beautiful and compassionate, filled with tears; He will forget His sorrows so as to console you in yours, merely because you yourselves go to Him to be consoled, and you turn your head to look at Him.
6. O Lord of the world, my true Spouse! (You can say this to Him if He has moved your heart to pity at seeing Him thus, for not",2,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,3,1,15,20,0,1,10,3,5,8,10,6,15,3,2,8,1,1,0
"104",1566,91,"only will you desire to look at Him but you will also delight in speaking with Him, not with ready-made prayers but with those that come from the sorrow of your own heart, for He esteems them highly.) Are You so in need, my Lord and my Love, that You would want to receive such poor company as mine, for I see by Your expression that You have been consoled by me? Well then, how is it Lord that the angels leave You and that even Your Father doesn't console You? If it's true, Lord, that You want to endure everything for me, what is this that I suffer for You? Of what am I complaining? I am already ashamed, since I have seen You in such a condition. I desire to suffer, Lord, all the trials that come to me and esteem them as a great good enabling me to imitate You in something. Let us walk together, Lord. Wherever You go, I will go; whatever you suffer, I will suffer.
7. Take up that cross, daughters. Don't mind at all if the Jews trample upon you, if His trial can thereby be lessened. Pay no attention to what they say to you, be deaf to their gossip. In stumbling, in falling with your Spouse, do not withdraw from the cross or abandon it. Consider carefully the fatigue with which He walks and how much greater His trials are than those trials you suffer, however great you may want to paint them and no matter how much you grieve over them. You will come out consoled because you will see that they are something to be laughed at when compared to those of the Lord.
8. You will ask, Sisters, how you can do this, saying that if you had seen His Majesty with your bodily eyes at the time He walked in this world that you would have looked at Him very willingly and done so always. Don't believe it. Whoever doesn't want to use a little effort now to recollect at least the sense of sight and look at this Lord within herself (for one can do so without danger but with just a little care) would have been much less able to stay at the foot of the cross with the Magdalene, who saw His death with her own eyes. But how much the glorious Virgin and this blessed saint must have suffered! How many threats, how many wicked words, how much shoving about and rudeness!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,12,2,17,12,1,4,10,5,11,15,8,6,11,4,0,5,2,2,0
"105",1566,92,"For the people around them were not exactly what we would call courteous! No, they were people from hell, ministers of the devil. Indeed, what these two suffered must have been terrible; but in the presence of another greater affliction they didn't feel their own.
So, Sister, don't think you are capable of such great trials if you are not capable of such little ones. By exercising yourselves in these little trials, you will come to be able to suffer other greater ones. [And believe that I am speaking the truth in saying that you can speak with Him, for I have passed through this difficulty.]
9. What you can do as a help in this matter is try to carry about an image or painting of this Lord that is to your liking, not so as to carry it about on your heart and never look at it but so as to speak often with Him; for He will inspire you with what to say. Since you speak with other persons, why must words fail you more when you speak with God? Don't believe they will; at least I will not believe they will if you acquire the habit. Otherwise, the failure to communicate with a person causes both estrangement and a failure to know how to speak with him. For it seems then that we don't know him, even if he may be a relative; family ties and friendship are lost through a lack of communication.
10. It is also a great help to take a good book written in the vernacular in order to recollect one's thoughts and pray well vocally, and little by little accustom the soul with coaxing and skill not to grow discouraged. Imagine that many years have passed since the soul left the house of its Spouse and that until it returns to this house there's a great need that it know how to deal with Him. For so we sinners are: our soul and our thoughts are so accustomed to wandering about at their own pleasure -- or grief, to put it better -- that the poor soul doesn't understand itself. In order that it get to love remaining at home once again, a great deal of skill is necessary. If little by little this is not accomplished, we shall never do anything.
And I again assure you that if with care you grow accustomed to what I have said your gain will be so great that even if I wanted to explain this",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,4,1,11,1,12,16,0,1,8,16,6,12,12,9,2,9,1,1,1,1,0
"106",1566,93,"to you I wouldn't know how. Draw near, then, to this good Master with strong determination to learn what He teaches you, and His Majesty will so provide that you will turn out to be good disciples. He will not abandon you if you do not abandon Him. Consider the words that divine mouth speaks, for in the first word you will understand immediately the love He has for you; it is no small blessing and gift for the disciple to see that his Master loves him.

CHAPTER 27
 
Deals with the great love our Lord showed us in the first words of the Our Father and how important it is for those who truly want to be children of God to pay no attention whatsoever to lineage.
 
1. Our Father who art in heaven. O my Lord, how You do show Yourself to be the Father of such a Son; and how Your Son does show Himself to be the Son of such a Father! May You be blessed forever and ever! This favor would not be so great, Lord, if it came at the end of the prayer. But at the beginning, You fill our hands and give a reward so large that it would easily fill the intellect and thus occupy the will in such a way one would be unable to speak a word.
Oh, daughters, how readily should perfect contemplation come at this point! Oh, how right it would be for the soul to enter within itself in order to rise the better above itself that this holy Son might make it understand the nature of the place where He says His Father dwells, which is in the heavens. Let us go forth from the earth, my daughters, for there is no reason that a favor like this should be so little esteemed, that after we have understood how great it is, we should still want to remain on earth.
2. O Son of God and my Lord! How is it that You give so much all together in the first words? Since You humble Yourself to such an extreme in joining with us in prayer and making Yourself the Brother of creatures so lowly and wretched, how is it that You give us in the name of Your Father everything that can be given? For You desire that He consider us His children, because Your word cannot fail. You oblige Him to be true to Your word, which is no small burden since in being",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,1,15,0,6,26,1,0,4,11,16,13,4,7,1,3,1,2,0,3,0
"107",1566,94,"Father He must bear with us no matter how serious the offenses. If we return to Him like the prodigal son, He has to pardon us. He has to console us in our trials. He has to sustain us in the way a father like this must. For, in effect, He must be better than all the fathers in the world because in Him everything must be faultless. And after all this He must make us sharers and heirs with You.
3. Behold, my Lord, that since with the love You bear us and with Your humility, nothing will stop you ... in sum, Lord, You are on earth and clothed with it. Since You possess our nature, it seems You have some reason to look to our gain. But behold, Your Father is in heaven. You Yourself said so. It is right that You look to His honor. Since You have vowed to undergo disgrace for us, leave Your Father free. Don't oblige Him to do so much for a people so wretched, like myself, who will not thank You properly [and there are no others who will do better.]
4. O good Jesus! How clearly You have shown that You are one with Him, and that Your will is His and His, Yours! How clear your declaration, my Lord! How magnificent it is, the love You bear us! You made use of roundabout ways, hiding from the devil the fact that You are the Son of God; and with the great desire You have for our good, nothing was able to stop You from granting us so very great a favor. Who could have done it but You, Lord? I don't know how the devil failed to understand in these words who You were, and had doubts about it. At least I see it clearly, my Jesus. You have spoken, as a favored son, for Yourself and for us; and You are powerful enough so that what You say on earth will be done in heaven. May You be blessed forever, my Lord, for You are so willing to give that nothing will stop You from doing so.
5. Well, daughters, doesn't it seem to you that this Master is a good one, since in order to make us grow fond of learning what He teaches us He begins by granting us so wonderful a favor? Does it seem right to you now that even though we recite these first words vocally we should fail to let our intellects",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,13,0,8,26,1,1,2,8,16,9,7,13,4,3,1,0,0,2,0
"108",1566,95,"understand and our hearts break in pieces at seeing such love? What son is there in the world who doesn't strive to learn who his father is when he knows he has such a good one with so much majesty and power? If our Father had not so much majesty, it wouldn't surprise me if we refused to be known as His children. The world has come to such a state that if the father is of a lower status than his son, the son doesn't feel honored in recognizing him as his father.
6. Such an attitude doesn't belong here. In this house, please God, may there never be any thought about such a thing; it would be a hell. But the one who is from nobler lineage should be the one to speak least about her father. All the Sisters must be equal.
O college of Christ, where St. Peter, being a fisherman, had more authority -- and the Lord wanted it so -- than St. Bartholomew, who was a king's son! His Majesty knew what would take place in the world where people dispute over lineage. These disputes in reality amount to nothing much more than a debate about whether the mud is better for making bricks or adobes. God help me, what a great trial we bear! God deliver us, Sisters, from similar disputes, even though they be in jest; I hope in His Majesty that He will do so. When this concern about lineage is noticed in a Sister, apply a remedy at once and let her fear lest she be Judas among the apostles. Give her penances until she understands that she doesn't deserve to be thought of as made from even a very wretched kind of mud.
You have a good Father, for He gives you the good Jesus. Let no one in this house speak of any other father but Him. And strive, my daughters, so to behave that you will deserve to find your delight in Him; and cast yourselves into His arms. You already know that He will not reject you if you are good daughters. Who, then, would fail to strive so as not to lose such a Father?
7. Oh, God help me! How much there is in these words to give you consolation. So as not to enlarge any more on this matter, I want to leave it to your own reflection. For no matter how unruly one's mind may be, the truth is -- leaving aside our gain",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,9,0,6,13,1,1,4,14,4,13,11,5,1,2,1,2,0,1,0
"109",1566,96,"in having so good a Father -- that the Holy Spirit must be present between such a Son and such a Father, and He will enkindle your will and bind it with a very great love. For Mother Prioress in Salamanca.
1. Jesus be with your reverence. Let me know how you are and how all the nuns are as well, and give them my regards. Tell them I would like to be enjoying their company along with that of the nuns here. I believe I will have less difficulty here than I thought. And from my hermitage, and also from where I sleep, there's a view of the river -- I can enjoy it while in bed, a most refreshing experience for me. I have felt better today than usual. Doña Quiteria has her customary fever; she says she misses all of you. They have brought a doctor here for Señora Doña Jerónima, for she is still sick. Pray for her there, as we are doing so here; I am worried about her. May God guide you.
2. The duchess sent me this trout today. It looked so good that I got this messenger to deliver it to my Padre Maestro Fray Bartolomé de Medina. If it arrives at dinner time, send it to him at once through Miguel, and this letter as well. And if it arrives later, send it to him anyway to see if he's willing to write a few lines.
3. Don't neglect to write me about how you are, and don't neglect to eat meat these days. Tell the doctor about your infirmity and give him my best regards. Anyway, may God be always with you, amen.
4. Give my regards to my Padre Osma and tell him I greatly miss him here. Let me know how Juana de Jesús is, for she had a very pale face the day I left.
Today is Wednesday after the twelfth, and I am yours,
Teresa of Jesus
5. How is the countess? And the magistrate's wife? Send someone to find out and let me know about it. I will write about how your sister is, for I did not want to send Navarro until I knew; through him I will also send you something. He will bring these sixteen reales, if I remember tomorrow, for today I also forgot. If Lescano should ask for something, give it to him, for I will repay you. I told him that if he needs something you would give it to him. I'm quite sure",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,10,0,6,12,1,0,4,9,6,12,14,5,3,1,1,2,4,1,2
"110",1566,97,"he will not ask. 1. May the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, amen.
It wouldn't be wrong for me to exaggerate this service I have rendered you in order that you feel obliged to take great care to pray to our Lord for me. For I certainly must have the right to ask this of you from what I have undergone in writing about myself and calling to mind so many of my miseries; although I can truthfully say it was more difficult for me to write about the favors His Majesty granted me than about my offenses against him.
2. I did what you commanded me and enlarged upon the material. I did this on the condition that you do what you promised by tearing up what appears to you to be bad. I hadn't finished reading it after the writing was done when you sent for it. It could be that some of the things are poorly explained and others put down twice, for I had so little time I couldn't read over what I wrote. I ask you to correct it and have it transcribed if it is to be brought to Padre Maestro Avila, for it could happen that someone might recognize my handwriting. I urgently desire that he be asked for his opinion about it, since this was my intention in beginning to write. If it seems to him I am walking on a good path, I shall be very consoled; then nothing else would remain for me than to do what lies within my power. Nevertheless, do what you think best, and remember you are obliged to one who has so entrusted her soul to you.
3. I shall recommend your soul to our Lord for the rest of my life. So do me the favor of hurrying to serve His Majesty; for you will see, from what is written here, how well one is occupied when one gives oneself entirely -- as you have begun to do -- to him who so immeasurably gives himself to us.
4. May he be blessed forever! I hope in his mercy that you and I will see each other there where we shall behold more clearly the great things he has done for us, and praise him forever and ever, amen.
This book was finished in June 1562. And if something of this attitude is present in one of the nuns, don't consent to having her in the house; she is a Judas among the apostles. Do",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,1,1,14,0,6,15,1,2,1,6,3,11,13,10,2,1,1,0,1,0,0
"111",1566,98,"all you can to free yourselves from such bad company. And if you cannot do this, punish her with more severe penances than you would use for any other fault, until she recognizes that she doesn't deserve to be made from even a very wretched kind of mud. The good Jesus gives you a good Father. Let no one in this house speak about any other father than the one your Spouse has given you. CHAPTER 28
 
Explains the nature of the prayer of recollection and sets down some ways of getting accustomed to this form of prayer.
 
1. Now consider what your Master says: Who art in heaven. Do you think it's of little importance to know what heaven is and where you must seek your most sacred Father? Well, I tell you that for wandering minds it is very important not only to believe these truths but to strive to understand them by experience. Doing this is one of the ways of greatly slowing down the mind and recollecting the soul.
2. You already know that God is everywhere. It's obvious, then, that where the king is there is his court; in sum, wherever God is, there is heaven. Without a doubt you can believe that where His Majesty is present, all glory is present. Consider what St. Augustine says, that he sought Him in many places but found Him ultimately within himself. Do you think it matters little for a soul with a wandering mind to understand this truth and see that there is no need to go to heaven in order to speak with one's Eternal Father or find delight in Him? Nor is there any need to shout. However softly we speak, He is near enough to hear us. Neither is there any need for wings to go to find Him. All one need do is go into solitude and look at Him within oneself, and not turn away from so good a Guest but with great humility speak to Him as to a father. Beseech Him as you would a father; tell Him about your trials; ask Him for a remedy against them, realizing that you are not worthy to be His daughters.
3. Leave aside any of that faintheartedness that some persons have and think is humility. You see, humility doesn't consist in refusing a favor the King offers you but in accepting such a favor and understanding how bountifully it comes to you and being delighted with it. What a nice kind",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,12,0,5,21,1,1,0,21,3,8,11,7,3,8,1,0,1,0,0
"112",1566,99,"of humility! I have the Emperor of heaven and earth in my house (for He comes to it in order to favor me and be happy with me), and out of humility I do not want to answer Him or stay with Him or take what he gives me, but I leave Him alone. Or, while He is telling me and begging me to ask Him for something, I do not do so but remain poor; and I even let Him go, for He sees that I never finish trying to make up my mind.
Have nothing to do with this kind of humility, daughters, but speak with Him as with a father, or a brother, or a lord, or as with a spouse; sometimes in one way, at other times in another; He will teach you what you must do in order to please Him. Don't be foolish; take Him at His word. Since He is your Spouse, He will treat you accordingly. [Consider that it is well worthwhile for you to have understood this truth: that the Lord is within us, and that there we must be with Him.]
4. The intellect is recollected much more quickly with this kind of prayer even though it may be vocal; it is a prayer that brings with it many blessings. This prayer is called ""recollection,"" because the soul collects its faculties together and enters within itself to be with its God. And its divine Master comes more quickly to teach it and give it the prayer of quiet than He would through any other method it might use. For centered there within itself, it can think about the Passion and represent the Son and offer Him to the Father and not tire the intellect by going to look for Him on Mount Calvary or in the garden or at the pillar.
5. Those who by such a method can enclose themselves within this little heaven of our soul, where the Maker of heaven and earth is present, and grow accustomed to refusing to be where the exterior senses in their distraction have gone or look in that direction should believe they are following an excellent path and that they will not fail to drink water from the fount; for they will journey far in a short time. Their situation is like that of a person who travels by ship; with a little wind he reaches the end of his journey in a few days. But those who go by land take",1,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,3,2,2,14,0,4,17,1,0,2,8,5,5,14,4,3,2,0,0,1,1,2
"113",1566,100,"longer. [It's the path of heaven. I say ""of heaven,"" because they are there in the palace of the King; they are not on earth and are more secure against many occasions.]
6. Those who know how to recollect themselves are already out to sea, as they say. For even though they may not have got completely away from land, they do what they can during that time to get free from it by recollecting their senses within. If the recollection is true, it is felt very clearly; for it produces some effect in the soul. I don't know how to explain it. Whoever has experienced it will understand; the soul is like one who gets up from the table after winning a game, for it already sees what the things of the world are. It rises up at the best time, as one who enters a fortified castle to be safe from enemies. There is a withdrawing of the senses from exterior things and a renunciation of them in such a way that, without one's realizing it, the eyes close so as to avoid seeing them and so that the sight might be more awake to things of the soul.
So, anyone who walks by this path keeps his eyes closed almost as often as he prays. This is a praiseworthy custom for many reasons. It is a striving so as not to look at things here below. This striving comes at the beginning; afterward, there's no need to strive; a greater effort is needed to open the eyes while praying. It seems the soul is aware of being strengthened and fortified at the expense of the body, that it leaves the body alone and weakened, and that it receives in this recollection a supply of provisions to strengthen it against the body.
7. And even though it isn't aware of this at the beginning, since the recollection is not so deep -- for there are greater and lesser degrees of recollection -- the soul should get used to this recollection; although in the beginning the body causes difficulty because it claims its rights without realizing that it is cutting off its own head by not surrendering. If we make the effort, practice this recollection for some days, and get used to it, the gain will be clearly seen; we will understand, when beginning to pray, that the bees are approaching and entering the beehive to make honey. And this recollection will be effected without our effort because the Lord",1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,2,12,0,5,12,1,1,1,25,15,5,10,4,8,2,1,8,1,0,0
"114",1566,101,"has desired that, during the time the faculties are drawn inward, the soul and its will may merit to have this dominion. When the soul does no more than give a sign that it wishes to be recollected, the senses obey it and become recollected. Even though they go out again afterward, their having already surrendered is a great thing; for they go out as captives and subjects and do not cause the harm they did previously. And when the will calls them back again, they come more quickly, until after many of these entries the Lord wills that they rest entirely in perfect contemplation.
8. May what has been said be well understood; even though it seems obscure, it will be understood by anyone who desires to practice it.
Therefore, those who know how to recollect themselves are like those who travel by sea; and since it is important for us not to proceed so slowly, let us speak a little about how we should get accustomed to a method that's so good. These souls are safer from many occasions. The fire of divine love is more quickly enkindled when they blow a little with their intellects. Since they are close to the fire, a little spark will ignite and set everything ablaze. Because there is no impediment from outside, the soul is alone with its God; it is well prepared for this enkindling. [I would like you to understand clearly this manner of prayer, which, as I have said, is called recollection.]
9. Well, let us imagine that within us is an extremely rich palace, built entirely of gold and precious stones; in sum, built for a lord such as this. Imagine, too, as is indeed so, that you have a part to play in order for the palace to be so beautiful; for there is no edifice as beautiful as is a soul pure and full of virtues. The greater the virtues the more resplendent the jewels. Imagine, also, that in this palace dwells this mighty King who has been gracious enough to become your Father; and that He is seated upon an extremely valuable throne, which is your heart.
10. This may seem trifling at the beginning; I mean, this image I've used in order to explain recollection. But the image may be very helpful -- to you especially -- for since we women have no learning, all of this imagining is necessary that we may truly understand that within us lies something incomparably more precious than what",2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,1,10,0,4,26,1,1,1,23,11,5,10,12,4,3,2,1,0,1,0
"115",1566,102,"we see outside ourselves. Let's not imagine that we are hollow inside. And please God it may be only women that go about forgetful of this inner richness and beauty. I consider it impossible for us to pay so much attention to worldly things if we take the care to remember we have a Guest such as this within us, for we then see how lowly these things are next to what we possess within ourselves. Well, what else does an animal do upon seeing what is pleasing to its sight than satisfy its hunger by taking the prey? Indeed, there should be some difference between them and us.
11. You will laugh at me, perhaps, and say that what I'm explaining is very clear, and you'll be right; for me, though, it was obscure for some time. I understood well that I had a soul. But what this soul deserved and who dwelt within it I did not understand because I had covered my eyes with the vanities of the world. For, in my opinion, if I had understood as I do now that in this little palace of my soul dwelt so great a King, I would not have left Him alone so often. I would have remained with Him at times and striven more so as not to be so unclean. But what a marvelous thing, that He who would fill a thousand worlds and many more with His grandeur would enclose Himself in something so small! [And so He wanted to enclose Himself in the womb of His most Blessed Mother.] In fact, since He is Lord He is free to do what He wants, and since He loves us He adapts Himself to our size.
12. So that the soul won't be disturbed in the beginning by seeing that it is too small to have something so great within itself, the Lord doesn't give it this knowledge until He enlarges it little by little and it has the capacity to receive what He will place within it. For this reason I say He is free to do what He wants since He has the power to make this palace a large one. The whole point is that we should give ourselves to Him with complete determination, and we should empty the soul in such a way that He can store things there or take them away as though it were His own property. And since His Majesty has the rights of ownership, let us not",4,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,9,0,4,17,1,0,3,11,8,13,13,4,7,2,0,2,0,2,1
"116",1566,103,"oppose Him. [Even here below guests in the house are a bother when we cannot tell them to leave.] And since He doesn't force our will, He takes what we give Him; but He doesn't give Himself completely until we give ourselves completely.
This fact is certain; and because it is so important, I bring it to your minds so often. He never works in the soul as He does when it is totally His without any obstacle, nor do I see how He could. He is the friend of all good order. Now, then, if we fill the palace with lowly people and trifles, how will there be room for the Lord with His court? He does enough by remaining just a little while in the midst of so much confusion.
13. Do you think, daughters, that He comes alone? Don't you see that His Son says, ""who art in heaven""? Well, since He is such a King, certainly His court attendants would never leave Him alone, but they will always be with Him; and they beseech Him on our behalf since they are full of charity. Don't think that things in heaven are like they are here below; for if here below a lord or prelate, because of certain of his own aims or because he wants to, favors someone, the envy of others is immediately stirred, and that poor person is hated without having done anything against them.

CHAPTER 29
 
Continues to present means for obtaining this prayer of recollection. How little it should matter to us whether or not we are favored by the bishop.
 
1. For the love of God, daughters, don't bother about being favored by lords or prelates. Let each nun strive to do what she ought; if the bishop doesn't show gratitude for what she does, she can be sure that the Lord will repay and be grateful for it. Indeed, we have not come here to seek a reward in this life. Let us always direct our thoughts to what is lasting and pay no attention to things here below, for even though our lives are short these preferences do not last for us. Today the bishop will favor one Sister, and tomorrow he will favor you if he sees one virtue more in you; and if he doesn't favor you, it matters little. Give no room to these thoughts. Sometimes they begin in a small way, but they can become very disturbing to you. Cut them off with the thought that",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,3,3,13,0,10,23,2,5,3,10,10,11,15,14,3,1,0,0,1,1,0
"117",1566,104,"your kingdom is not here below and of how quickly all things come to an end.
2. But even this kind of remedy is a lowly one and not indicative of great perfection. It is better that this disfavor of your superior continue, that you be unappreciated and humbled, and that you accept this for the Lord who is with you. Turn your eyes inward and look within yourself, as has been said. You will find your Master, for He will not fail you; rather, the less you have of exterior consolation the more He will favor you. He is very merciful, and He never fails persons who are afflicted and despised if they trust in Him alone. So, David says that the Lord is with the afflicted. Either you believe this or you don't. If you believe it, then why are you killing yourselves?
3. O my Lord, if we truly knew You we wouldn't care at all about anything, for You give much to those who sincerely want to trust in You! Believe, my friends, that it is a great thing to have knowledge of this truth so that you can then see that all favors here below are a lie when they divert the soul somewhat from entering within itself. Oh, God help me, who will make you understand this! Certainly, not I; for I know that I, who more than anyone should understand, have not succeeded in understanding it as it should be understood.
4. Now to return to what I was saying. I would like to know a way of explaining how this holy fellowship with our Companion, the Saint of saints, may be experienced without any hindrance to the solitude enjoyed between the soul and its Spouse when the soul desires to enter this paradise within itself to be with its God and close the door to all the world. I say ""desires"" because you must understand that this recollection is not something supernatural, but that it is something we can desire and achieve ourselves with the help of God -- for without this help we can do nothing, not even have a good thought. This recollection is not a silence of the faculties; it is an enclosure of the faculties within the soul.
5. The soul gains from this recollection in many ways as is written in some books [on mental prayer. Since I'm speaking only of how vocal prayer should be recited well, there's no reason to say so much. What I'm trying to",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,1,0,18,1,6,22,0,2,4,20,8,14,12,10,3,7,0,1,0,0,0
"118",1566,105,"point out is that we should see and be present to the One with whom we speak without turning our backs on Him, for I don't think speaking with God while thinking of a thousand other vanities would amount to anything else but turning our backs on Him. All the harm comes from not truly understanding that He is near, but in imagining Him as far away. And indeed how far, if we go to heaven to seek Him! Now, is Your face such, Lord, that we would not look at it when You are so close to us? If people aren't looking at us when we speak, it doesn't seem to us that they are listening to what we say. And do we close our eyes to avoid seeing that You, Lord, are looking at us? How will we know whether You've heard what we're saying to You? This alone is what I want to explain: that in order to acquire the habit of easily recollecting our minds and understanding what we are saying, and with whom we are speaking, it is necessary that the exterior senses be recollected and that we give them something with which to be occupied. For indeed we have heaven within ourselves since the Lord of heaven is there.]
We must, then, disengage ourselves from everything so as to approach God interiorly and even in the midst of occupations withdraw within ourselves. Although it may be for only a moment that I remember I have that Company within myself, doing so is very beneficial. In sum, we must get used to delighting in the fact that it isn't necessary to shout in order to speak to Him, for His Majesty will give the experience that He is present.
6. With this method we shall pray vocally with much calm, and any difficulty will be removed. For in the little amount of time we take to force ourselves to be close to this Lord, He will understand us as if through sign language. Thus if we are about to say the Our Father many times, He will understand us after the first. He is very fond of taking away our difficulty. Even though we may recite this prayer no more than once in an hour, we can be aware that we are with Him, of what we are asking Him, of His willingness to give us, and how eagerly He remains with us. If we have this awareness, He doesn't want us to be breaking",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,11,0,5,10,1,0,1,16,7,12,11,10,6,12,0,2,0,0,0
"119",1566,106,"our heads trying to speak a great deal to Him. [Therefore, Sisters, out of love for the Lord, get used to praying the Our Father with this recollection, and you will see the benefit before long. This is a manner of praying that the soul gets so quickly used to that it doesn't go astray, nor do the faculties become restless, as time will tell. I only ask that you try this method, even though it may mean some struggle; everything involves struggle before the habit is acquired. But I assure you that before long it will be a great consolation for you to know that you can find this holy Father, whom you are beseeching, within you without tiring yourself in seeking where He is.]
7. May the Lord teach this recollection to those of you who don't know about it, for I confess that I never knew what it was to pray with satisfaction until the Lord taught me this method. And it is because I have always found so many benefits from this habit of recollection that I have enlarged so much upon it.
I conclude by saying that whoever wishes to acquire it -- since, as I say, it lies within our power -- should not tire of getting used to what has been explained. It involves a gradual increase of self-control and an end to vain wandering from the right path; it means conquering, which is a making use of one's senses for the sake of the inner life. If you speak, strive to remember that the One with whom you are speaking is present within. If you listen, remember that you are going to hear One who is very close to you when He speaks. In sum, bear in mind that you can, if you want, avoid ever withdrawing from such good company; and be sorry that for a long time you left your Father alone, of whom you are so much in need. If you can, practice this recollection often during the day; if not, do so a few times. As you become accustomed to it you will experience the benefit, either sooner or later. Once this recollection is given by the Lord, you will not exchange it for any treasure.
8. Since nothing is learned without a little effort, consider, Sisters, for the love of God, as well employed the attention you give to this method of prayer. I know, if you try, that within a year, or perhaps half a year, you",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,1,12,0,8,12,4,1,1,24,10,10,14,5,1,8,0,1,3,2,0
"120",1566,107,"will acquire it, by the favor of God. See how little time it takes for a gain as great as is that of laying a good foundation. If then the Lord should desire to raise you to higher things He will discover in you the readiness, finding that you are close to Him. May it please His Majesty that we not consent to withdrawing from His presence. Amen. [Perhaps all of you know what I've explained, but someone may come along who will not know it. For that reason don't be annoyed that I've mentioned it here. Now let us come to learn how our good Master continues and begins to petition His holy Father for us; it is good that we understand what He asks.]

CHAPTER 30
 
The importance of understanding what is being asked for in prayer. Deals with the next words of the Our Father: Sanctificetur nomen tuum, adveniat regnum tuum. Applies these words to the prayer of quiet and begins to explain this kind of prayer.
 
1. Is there anyone, however foolish, who when he is about to ask for something from an important person doesn't think over how he should go about asking? He must find favor with this person and not seem rude. He thinks about what he should ask for and why he needs it, especially if he is asking for something significant, which is what our good Jesus teaches us to ask for. There is something it seems to me that should be noted: Couldn't You, my Lord, have concluded the Our Father with the words: ""Give us, Father, what is fitting for us""? It doesn't seem there would have been need to say anything else to One who understands everything so well.
2. O Eternal Wisdom! Between You and Your Father these words would have sufficed. Your petition in the garden was like this. You manifested Your own desire and fear, but You abandoned them to His will. Yet, You know us, my Lord, that we are not as surrendered to the will of Your Father as You were. You know that it was necessary for You to make those specific requests so that we might pause to consider if what we are seeking is good for us, so that if it isn't we won't ask for it. If we aren't given what we want, being what we are, with this free will we have, we might not accept what the Lord gives. For although what He gives is better, we",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,11,0,5,18,1,2,1,22,8,18,19,4,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"121",1566,108,"don't think we'll ever become rich, since we don't at once see the money in our hand.
3. Oh, God help me! What a pity to have so unawakened a faith that we never come to understand fully the certainty of both punishment and reward! As a result it is good, daughters, that you understand what you are asking for in the Our Father so that if the Eternal Father should offer it to you, you will not scoff at it. And consider very carefully whether what you ask for is good for you; if it isn't, don't ask for it, but ask His Majesty to give you light. For we are blind and feel loathing for the food that will give us life; we want the food that will bring us death. And what a death! So dangerous and so everlasting!
4. Well, Jesus says that we may recite these words in which we ask for a kingdom like His to come within us: ""Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come within us.""
Now behold, daughters, how great the wisdom of our Master is. I am reflecting here on what we are asking for when we ask for this kingdom, and it is good that we understood our request. But since His Majesty saw that we could neither hallow, nor praise, nor extol, nor glorify this holy name of the Eternal Father in a fitting way, because of the tiny amount we ourselves are capable of doing, He provided for us by giving us here on earth His kingdom. That is why Jesus put these two petitions next to each other. I want to tell you here, daughters, what I understand so that we may know what we are asking for and the importance of our begging persistently for it, and do as much as we can so as to please the One who is to give it to us. If I do not satisfy you, you can think up other reflections yourselves. Our Master will allow us to make these reflections provided that we submit in all things to what the Church holds, as I do [always. And I will not even give you this to read until learned persons have seen it. At least, if there is anything incorrect, the error will not be done through malice but for my not knowing any better.]
5. Now, then, the great good that it seems to me there will be in the kingdom of heaven, among many other blessings, is that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,3,9,2,3,23,0,2,1,16,8,8,9,5,4,1,2,1,2,0,2
"122",1566,109,"one will no longer take any account of earthly things, but have a calmness and glory within, rejoice in the fact that all are rejoicing, experience perpetual peace and a wonderful inner satisfaction that comes from seeing that everyone hallows and praises the Lord and blesses His name and that no one offends Him. Everyone loves Him there, and the soul itself doesn't think about anything else than loving Him; nor can it cease loving Him, because it knows Him. And would that we could love Him in this way here below, even though we may not be able to do so with such perfection or stability. But if we knew Him we would love in a way very different from that in which we do love Him.
6. It seems I'm saying that we would have to be angels in order to make this petition and recite well our vocal prayers. Our divine Master would truly desire this since He asks us to make so lofty a petition, and certainly He doesn't tell us to ask for impossible things. The above would be possible, through the favor of God, for a soul placed in this exile, but not with the perfection of those who have gone forth from this prison; for we are at sea and journeying along this way. But there are times when, tired from our travels, we experience that the Lord calms our faculties and quiets the soul. As though by signs, He gives us a clear foretaste of what will be given to those He brings to His kingdom. And to those to whom He gives here below the kingdom we ask for, He gives pledges so that through these they may have great hope of going to enjoy perpetually what here on earth is given only in sips.
7. If you wouldn't say that I'm treating of contemplation, this petition would provide a good opportunity for speaking a little about the beginning of pure contemplation; those who experience this prayer call it the prayer of quiet. But since, as I say, I'm dealing with vocal prayer, it may seem to anyone who doesn't know about the matter that vocal prayer doesn't go with contemplation; but I know that it does. Pardon me, but I want to say this: I know there are many persons who while praying vocally, as has already been mentioned, are raised by God to sublime contemplation [without their striving for anything or understanding how. It's because of this that I",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,17,0,1,26,0,1,0,13,7,14,15,8,1,7,0,0,1,4,0
"123",1566,110,"insist so much, daughters, upon your reciting vocal prayer well.] I know a person who was never able to pray any way but vocally, and though she was tied to this form of prayer she experienced everything else. And if she didn't recite vocal prayer her mind wandered so much that she couldn't bear it. Would that our mental prayer were as good! She spent several hours reciting a certain number of Our Fathers, in memory of the times our Lord shed His blood, as well as a few other vocal prayers. Once she came to me very afflicted because she didn't know how to practice mental prayer nor could she contemplate; she could only pray vocally. I asked her how she was praying, and I saw that though she was tied to the Our Father she experienced pure contemplation and that the Lord was raising her up and joining her with Himself in union. And from her deeds it seemed truly that she was receiving such great favors, for she was living a very good life. So I praised the Lord and envied her for her vocal prayer.
If this account is true, as it is, those of you who are the enemies of contemplatives should not think that you are free from being a contemplative if you recite your vocal prayers as they should be recited, with a pure conscience. [And so I will speak of this again. Whoever doesn't want to hear it may pass on.] the holy Roman Church. CHAPTER 31
 
Continues on the same subject. Explains the nature of the prayer of quiet. Gives some advice for those who experience it. This chapter should be carefully noted.
 
1. Well, daughters, I nonetheless want to explain this prayer of quiet. I have heard talk about it, or the Lord had given me understanding of it, perhaps, that I might tell you of it [and that others may praise Him; although since I have written about it elsewhere, as I said, I will not give lengthy explanations but just say something.] In this prayer it seems the Lord begins, as I have said, to show that He hears our petition. He begins now to give us His kingdom here below so that we may truly praise and hallow His name and strive that all persons do so.
2. This prayer is something supernatural, something we cannot procure through our own efforts. In it the soul enters into peace or, better, the Lord puts it at peace by",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,3,27,0,3,19,0,2,0,14,4,12,17,9,1,9,0,1,3,0,0
"124",1566,111,"His presence, as he did to the just Simeon, so that all the faculties are calmed. The soul understands in another way, very foreign to the way it understands through the exterior senses, that it is now close to its God and that not much more would be required for it to become one with Him in union. This is not because it sees Him with the eyes either of the body or of the soul. The just Simeon didn't see any more than the glorious, little, poor child. For by the way the child was clothed and by the few people that were in the procession, Simeon could have easily judged the babe to be the son of poor people rather than the Son of our heavenly Father. But the child Himself made Simeon understand. And this is how the soul understands here, although not with as much clarity. For the soul, likewise, fails to understand how it understands. But it sees it is in the kingdom, at least near the King who will give the kingdom to the soul. And seemingly the soul has so much reverence that it doesn't even dare ask for this. The state resembles an interior and exterior swoon; for the exterior man (or so that you will understand me better, I mean the body [for some simpleton will come along who won't know what ""interior"" and ""exterior"" means]) doesn't want any activity. But like one who has almost reached the end of his journey he wants to rest so as to be better able to continue; in this rest his strength for the journey is doubled.
3. A person feels the greatest delight in his body and a great satisfaction in his soul. He feels so happy merely with being close to the fount that he is satisfied even without drinking. It doesn't seem there is anything else for him to desire. The faculties are still; they wouldn't want to be busy; everything else seems to hinder them from loving. But they are not completely lost; they can think of who it is they are near, for two of them are free. The will is the one that is captive here. If there is some sorrow that can be experienced while in this state, that sorrow comes from a realization that the will must return to the state of being free. The intellect wouldn't want to understand more than one thing; nor would the memory want to be occupied with anything else.",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,1,0,4,9,0,4,17,0,0,4,21,4,14,13,4,4,0,2,4,0,0,1
"125",1566,112,"Persons in this prayer see that only this one thing is necessary, and everything else disturbs them. They don't want the body to move because it seems they would thereby lose that peace; thus they don't dare stir. It pains them to speak; in their saying ""Our Father"" just once a whole hour passes. They are so close that they see they are understanding as though through signs. They are within the palace, near the King, and they see that He is beginning to give them here His kingdom. It doesn't seem to them that they are in the world, nor would they want to see or hear about anything other than their God. Nothing pains them, nor does it seem anything ever will. In sum, while this prayer lasts they are so absorbed and engulfed with the satisfaction and delight they experience within themselves that they do not remember there is more to desire; they would eagerly say with St. Peter: ""Lord, let us build three dwelling places here.""
4. Sometimes in this prayer of quiet the Lord grants another favor which is very difficult to understand if there is not a great deal of experience. But if there is some experience, the one who receives it will immediately understand. It will be a great consolation for you to know what it is, and I believe God often grants this favor together with the other one. When this quiet is great and lasts for a long while, it seems to me that the will wouldn't be able to remain so long in that peace if it weren't bound to something. For it may happen that we will go about with this satisfaction for a day or two and will not understand ourselves -- I mean those who experience it -- and they definitely see that they are not wholly in what they are doing, but that the best part is lacking, that is, the will. The will, in my opinion, is then united with its God, and leaves the other faculties free to be occupied in what is for His service -- and they then have much more ability for this. But in worldly matters, these faculties are dull and at times as though in a stupor.
5. This is a great favor for those to whom the Lord grants it; the active and the contemplative lives are joined. The faculties all serve the Lord together: the will is occupied in its work and contemplation without knowing how; the",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,10,0,7,17,2,0,2,15,3,11,17,6,5,6,0,1,2,0,0
"126",1566,113,"other two faculties serve in the work of Martha. Thus Martha and Mary walk together.
I know someone whom the Lord often placed in this state. She didn't know what to make of it and asked a great contemplative. He answered that the experience was very possible, that it had happened to him. Thus, I think that because the soul is so satisfied in this prayer of quiet the faculty of the will remains more continually united with Him who alone can satisfy it.
6. I think it would be good here to give some counsels for those of you, Sisters, whom the Lord, solely through His goodness, has brought here, for I know there are some of you.
The first is that since they see themselves in that contentment and do not know how it came on them -- at least they see they cannot obtain it by themselves -- they experience this temptation: they think they'll be able to hold on to that satisfaction and they don't even dare take a breath. This is foolish, for just as there's nothing we can do to make the sun rise, there's little we can do to keep it from setting. This prayer is no longer our work, for it's something very supernatural and something very much beyond our power to acquire by ourselves. The best way to hold on to this favor is to understand clearly that we can neither bring it about nor remove it; we can only receive it with gratitude, as most unworthy of it; and this not with many words, but by raising our eyes to Him, as the publican did.
7. It is good to find more solitude so as to make room for the Lord and allow His Majesty to work as though with something belonging to Him. At most, a gentle word from time to time is sufficient, as in the case of one who blows on a candle to enkindle it again when it begins to die out. But if the candle is burning, blowing on it will in my opinion serve no other purpose than to put it out. I say that the blowing should be gentle lest the will be distracted by the intellect busying itself with many words.
8. And note well, friends, this counsel that I now wish to give, for you'll often see that you'll be unable to manage these other two faculties. It happens that the soul will be in the greatest quiet and the intellect will be so",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0,1,0,7,1,3,17,1,0,1,11,10,4,13,1,6,3,0,2,0,0,0
"127",1566,114,"distracted that it won't seem that the quiet is present in the intellect's house. It seems to the intellect, during that time, that it is nowhere else than in a stranger's house, as a guest, and seeking other dwelling places because the house it's in doesn't satisfy it and it knows little about how to remain stable. Perhaps it's only my intellect that's like this, and others' intellects are not. I am speaking about myself, for sometimes I want to die in that I cannot cure this wandering of the intellect. At other times I think it takes up residence in its own house and accompanies the will. It's a wonderful thing when all three faculties are in accord. It's like what happens between two married people: if they love each other, the one wants what the other wants. But if the husband is unhappily married, it's easy to see what disturbance he'll cause his wife. Thus when the will finds itself in this quiet [and note well this counsel, for the matter is important], it shouldn't pay any more attention to the intellect than it would to a madman. For should it want to keep the intellect near itself, it will necessarily have to be somewhat disturbed and disquieted. And in this state of prayer everything will then amount to working without any further gain but with a loss of what the Lord was giving the will without its own work.
9. And notice carefully this comparison [for the Lord put it in my mind while I was at prayer]; it seems to me very appropriate: the soul is like an infant that still nurses when at its mother's breast, and the mother without her babe's effort to suckle put the milk in its mouth in order to give it delight. So it is here; for without effort of the intellect the will is loving, and the Lord desires that the will, without thinking about the matter, understand that it is with Him and that it does no more than swallow the milk His Majesty places in its mouth, and enjoy that sweetness. For the will knows that it is the Lord who is granting that favor. And the will rejoices in its enjoyment. It doesn't desire to understand how it enjoys the favor or what it enjoys; but it forgets itself during that time, for the One who is near it will not forget to observe what is fitting for it. If the will goes out to",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,5,1,5,1,7,1,6,28,4,0,2,12,5,12,12,3,1,3,0,3,1,2,3
"128",1566,115,"fight with the intellect so as to give a share of the experience, by drawing the intellect after itself, it cannot do so at all; it will be forced to let the milk fall from its mouth and lose that divine nourishment.
10. This is the way this prayer of quiet is different from that prayer in which the entire soul is united with God, for then the soul doesn't even go through the process of swallowing this divine food. Without its understanding how, the Lord places the milk within it. In this prayer of quiet it seems that He wants it to work a little, although so gently that it almost doesn't feel its effort. [Whoever experiences this prayer will understand clearly what I'm saying if after having read this he reflects on it carefully; and let him consider how important the matter is. If he doesn't experience the prayer, this will seem like gibberish.] That which torments the will is the intellect. The intellect doesn't cause this torment when there is union of all three faculties, for He who created them suspends them. With the joy He gives them He keeps them all occupied without their knowing or understanding how. Thus, as I say, they feel this prayer within themselves, a quiet and great contentment of the will, without being able to discern what it is specifically. Yet the soul easily discerns that it is far different from earthly satisfactions and that ruling the world with all its delights wouldn't be enough to make the soul feel that delight within itself. The delight is in the interior of the will, for the other consolations of life, it seems to me, are enjoyed in the exterior of the will, as in the outer bark, we might say. When the will sees itself in this degree of prayer so sublime (for the prayer is, as I have already said, very recognizably supernatural), it laughs at the intellect as at a fool when this intellect -- or mind, to explain myself better -- goes off to the more foolish things of the world. The will remains in its quietude, for the intellect will come and go. In this prayer the will is the ruler and the powerful one. It will draw the intellect after itself without your being disturbed. And if the will should desire to draw the intellect by force of arms, the strength it has against the intellect will be lost. This strength comes from eating and receiving",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,17,0,6,31,1,1,2,16,9,7,10,6,1,8,3,2,1,0,5
"129",1566,116,"that divine food. And neither the will nor the intellect will gain anything, but both will lose. As the saying goes, whoever tries to grasp too much loses everything; this it seems to me is what will happen here. Experience will enable one to understand, for I wouldn't be surprised if to anyone who doesn't have this experience what I've said would seem very obscure and unnecessary. But I've already mentioned that with a little experience one will understand it, be able to benefit from it, and will praise the Lord because He was pleased that I managed to explain it here.
11. Now, then, let's conclude by saying that to the soul placed in this prayer it seems the Eternal Father has already here below granted its petition for His kingdom. Oh, blessed request, in which, without realizing it, we ask for so much good! What a blessed way of asking! For this reason, Sisters, I want us to look at how we recite this prayer, the Our Father, and all other vocal prayers. For when this favor is granted by God, we shall forget the things of the world; when the Lord of the world arrives He casts out everything else. I don't say that all those who experience this prayer must by necessity be completely detached from the world. At least, I would like them to know what is lacking and that they humble themselves and try to go on detaching themselves from everything; if they don't, they will remain in this state. A soul to whom God gives such pledges has a sign that He wants to give it a great deal; if not impeded through its own fault, it will advance very far. But if the Lord sees that after He places the kingdom of heaven in the soul's house this soul turns to earthly things, He will not only fail to show it the secrets there are in His kingdom but will seldom grant it this favor, and then for just a short space of time.
12. Now it could be that I am mistaken in this matter, but I see and know that this is what happens, and in my opinion this is why there are not many more spiritual persons. When individuals do not respond by service that is in conformity with so great a favor, when they do not prepare themselves to receive it again, but take back their wills from the hands of the Lord who already possesses these wills",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,0,19,0,5,16,0,0,3,13,5,13,11,7,3,4,1,1,0,0,1
"130",1566,117,"as His own, and set them upon base things, the Lord goes in search of those who do love Him so as to give more to them. Yet He doesn't take away entirely what He has given, when one lives with a pure conscience. But there are persons -- and I have been one of them -- who make themselves deaf when the Lord, taking pity on them, gives them holy inspirations and light concerning the nature of things, and, in sum, gives this kingdom and places them in this prayer of quiet. For they are so fond of speaking and reciting many vocal prayers very quickly, like one who wants to get a job done, since they oblige themselves to recite these every day, that even though, as I say, the Lord places His kingdom in their hands, they do not receive it. But with their vocal prayers they think they are doing better, and they distract themselves from the prayer of quiet.
13. Do not do this, Sisters, but be on your guard when the Lord grants you this favor. Consider that you are losing a great treasure and that you do much more by saying one word of the Our Father from time to time than by rushing through the entire prayer many times. You are very close to the One you petition; He will not fail to hear you. And believe that herein lies the true praise and hallowing of His name. For now, as one who is in His house, you glorify the Lord and praise Him with more affection and desire; and it seems that you cannot fail to serve Him. [Thus I counsel you to be very careful in this matter because it is extremely important.]

CHAPTER 32
 
Discuss the words of the Our Father, Fiat voluntas tua sicut in caelo et in terra; the great deal a person does when he says them with full determination; and how well the Lord repays this. [So I counsel you to be attentive because the matter is very important.]
 
1. Now that our Good Master has asked, and taught us to ask, for something so highly valuable that it includes everything we can desire here below and that He has granted us so wonderful a favor as to make us His brothers, let us see what He desires us to give His Father, and how He offers this gift for us and what He asks of us. For it is right that we somehow serve",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1,0,14,0,6,23,1,1,4,7,8,4,3,7,1,8,1,1,1,1,0
"131",1566,118,"Him in return for such great favors. O good Jesus! What You give on our behalf in return for what You requested for us is no small thing, although it really amounts to nothing when compared to the greatness of the Lord and what we owe Him. But certainly, my Lord, You do not leave us empty-handed when we give You everything we can -- I mean if we really give it, as we say we will.
2. ""Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."" You did well, good Master of ours, to make this petition so that we might accomplish what You give on our behalf. For certainly, Lord, if You hadn't made the petition, the task would seem to me impossible. But when Your Father does what You ask Him by giving us His kingdom here on earth, I know that we shall make Your words come true by giving what You give for us. For once the earth has become heaven, the possibility is there for Your will to be done in me. But if the earth hasn't -- and earth as wretched and barren as mine -- I don't know, Lord, how it will be possible. It is indeed a great thing, that which You offer!
3. When I think of this, I am amused by persons who don't dare ask for trials from the Lord, for they suppose that in doing so they will be given them at once. I'm not speaking of those who fail to do so out of humility, thinking they will be incapable of suffering them; although I myself hold that He, who gives these persons the love to ask for these means, which are so harsh, in order that they may show their love, will give them the capacity to suffer them. I would like to question those who fear to ask for trials, lest these be given them at once, about what they say when they beseech the Lord to do His will in them. Perhaps they say the words just to say what everyone else is saying but not so that His will be done. To do this, Sisters, would not be right. Consider that Jesus acts here as our ambassador and that He has desired to intervene between us and His Father, and at no small cost of His own. It would not be right for us to fail to do what He has offered on our behalf; if we don't want to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,2,10,0,6,17,1,0,5,10,4,11,12,5,0,6,0,0,0,2,0
"132",1566,119,"do it we shouldn't say these words.
4. Now let me put it in another way. Look, daughters, His will must be done whether we like this or not, and it will be done in heaven and on earth. Believe me, take my advice, and make a virtue of necessity. O my Lord, what a great comfort this is for me, that you didn't want the fulfillment of Your will to depend on a will as wretched as mine! May You be blessed forever, and may all things praise You! Your name be glorified forever! I'd be in a fine state, Lord, if it were up to me as to whether or not Your will were to be done! Now I freely give mine to You, even though I do so at a time in which I'm not free of self-interest. For I have felt and have had great experience of the gain that comes from freely abandoning my will to Yours. O friends, what a great gain there is here! Oh, what a great loss there is when we do not carry out what we offer to the Lord in the Our Father!
5. Before I tell you about what is gained, I want to explain the great deal you offer so that afterward you won't take back what you gave, claiming that you hadn't understood. Don't be like some religious who do nothing but promise; and when we don't follow through, we make an excuse saying we didn't understand what we were promising. And this could be so, because to say that we abandon our will to another's will seems very easy until through experience we realize that this is the hardest thing one can do if one does it as it should be done. But superiors are not always strict in leading us since they see we are weak. And at times they lead both the weak and the strong in the same way. With the Lord, such is not the case; He knows what each one can suffer. He does not delay in doing His will in anyone He sees has strength.
6. Well, I want to advise you and remind you what His will is. Don't fear that it means He will give you riches, or delights, or honors, or all these earthly things. His love for you is not that small, and He esteems highly what you give Him. He wants to repay you well, for He gives you His kingdom while you are still",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,8,0,7,30,1,0,4,9,7,10,13,6,3,3,2,0,2,1,0
"133",1566,120,"alive. Do you want to know how He answers those who say these words to Him sincerely? Ask His glorious Son, who said them while praying in the Garden. Since they were said with such determination and complete willingness, see if the Father's will wasn't done fully in Him through the trials, sorrows, injuries, and persecutions He suffered until His life came to an end through death on a cross.
7. Well, see here, daughters, what He gave to the one He loved most. By that we understand what His will is. For these are His gifts in this world. He gives according to the love He bears us: to those He loves more, He gives more of these gifts; to those He loves less, He gives less. And He gives according to the courage He sees in each and the love each has for His Majesty. He will see that whoever loves Him much will be able to suffer much for Him; whoever loves Him little will be capable of little. I myself hold that the measure for being able to bear a large or small cross is love. So, Sisters, if you love Him, strive that what you say to the Lord may not amount to mere polite words; strive to suffer what His Majesty desires you to suffer. For, otherwise, when you give your will, it would be like showing a jewel to another, making a gesture to give it away, and asking that he take it; but when he extends his hand to accept it, you pull yours back and hold on tightly to the jewel.
8. This is no way to mock Him who was the butt of so much mockery for our sakes. Even if there were no other reason, it would not be right to mock Him so often; the number of times we say the Our Father is not small. Let's give Him the jewel once and for all, no matter how many times we have tried to give it before. The truth is that He rewards us beforehand so that we might give it to Him. [Oh, God help me, how obvious it is that my good Jesus knows us! For He doesn't say at the outset that we should give this will to the Lord, but first reveals that we will be well paid for this little service and that the Lord wants us to benefit a great deal by it. Even in this life He begins to reward us,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,6,2,9,23,0,3,5,8,6,9,8,4,4,6,2,2,5,10,0
"134",1566,121,"as I shall now say.] Those in the world will be doing enough if they truly have the determination to do His will. You, daughters, will express this determination by both saying and doing, by both words and deeds, as indeed it seems we religious do. But at times we not only commit ourselves to giving the jewel but place it in His hand, only to take it back again. We are quick to be generous, but afterward so stingy that it would have been more fruitful, in part, if we had delayed in giving.
9. Because everything I have advised you about in this book is directed toward the complete gift of ourselves to the Creator, the surrender of our wills to His, and detachment from creatures -- and you have understood how important this is -- I'm not going to say any more about the matter; but I will explain why our good Master teaches us to say the words mentioned above, as one who knows the many things we gain by rendering this service to His eternal Father. For we are preparing ourselves that we may quickly reach the end of our journey and drink the living water from the fount we mentioned. Unless we give our wills entirely to the Lord so that in everything pertaining to us He might do what conforms with His will, we will never be allowed to drink from this fount. Drinking from it is perfect contemplation, that which you told me to write about.
10. In this contemplation, as I have already written, we don't do anything ourselves. Neither do we labor, nor do we bargain, nor is anything else necessary -- because everything else is an impediment and hindrance -- than to say fiat voluntas tua: Your will, Lord, be done in me in every way and manner that You, my Lord, want. If You want it to be done with trials, strengthen me and let them come; if with persecutions, illnesses, dishonors, and a lack of life's necessities, here I am; I will not turn away, my Father, nor is it right that I turn my back on You. Since Your Son gave You this will of mine in the name of all, there's no reason for any lack on my part. But grant me the favor of Your kingdom that I may do Your will, since He asked for this kingdom for me, and use me as You would Your own possession, in conformity with Your will.
11.",2,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,4,0,1,4,0,0,11,0,0,0,9,9,10,12,13,0,5,1,1,2,0,5
"135",1566,122,"O my Sisters, what strength lies in this gift! It does nothing less, when accompanied by the necessary determination, than draw the Almighty so that He becomes one with our lowliness, transforms us into Himself, and effects a union of the Creator with the creature. Behold whether or not you are well paid and have a good Master; since He knows how the love of His Father can be obtained, He teaches us how and by what means we must serve Him.
12. And the more our deeds show that these are not merely polite words, all the more does the Lord bring us to Himself and raise the soul from itself and all earthly things so as to make it capable of receiving great favors, for He never finishes repaying this service in the present life. He esteems it so highly that we do not ourselves know how to ask for ourselves, and His Majesty never tires of giving. Not content with having made this soul one with Himself, He begins to find His delight in it, reveal His secrets, and rejoice that it know what it has gained and something of what He will give it. He makes it lose these exterior senses so that nothing will occupy it. This is rapture. And he begins to commune with the soul in so intimate a friendship that He not only gives it back its own will but gives it His. For in so great a friendship the Lord takes joy in putting the soul in command, as they say, and He does what it asks since it does His will. And He does this even better than the soul itself could, for He is powerful and does whatever He wants and never stops wanting this.
13. The poor soul cannot do what it desires even though it may want to; nor can it give anything save what is given. This is its greatest wealth: the more it serves, the more indebted it remains. It often grows weary seeing itself subject to so many difficulties, impediments, and fetters, which result from dwelling in the prison of this body. It would want to repay something of what it owes. To grow weary is quite foolish; for even though one does what's in one's power, what can those of us repay who, as I say, don't have anything save what we have received? All we can do is know ourselves and what we are capable of, which is to give our will,",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,4,8,0,6,17,1,1,2,12,10,8,8,8,1,2,0,1,4,1,0
"136",1566,123,"and give it completely. Everything else encumbers the soul brought here by the Lord and causes it harm rather than benefit. Only humility can do something, a humility not acquired by the intellect, but by a clear perception that comprehends in a moment the truth one would be unable to grasp in a long time through the work of the imagination about what a trifle we are and how very great God is.
14. I give you one counsel: that you don't think that through your own strength or efforts you can arrive, for reaching this stage is beyond our power; if you try to reach it, the devotion you have will grow cold. But with simplicity and humility, which will achieve everything, say: fiat voluntas tua.

CHAPTER 33
 
Deals with the great need we have that the Lord give us what we ask for in these words of the Our Father: Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie.
 
1. As I have said, Jesus understands what a difficult thing it is He offers for us. He knows our weakness, that we often show we do not understand what the Lord's will is. We are weak and He is merciful. He knows that a means was necessary. He saw it would not be in any way to our benefit if we failed to give what He gave, because all our gain lies in giving this. He saw that doing the Father's will was difficult. If we tell a rich person living in luxury that it is God's will that he be careful and use moderation at table so that others might at least have bread to eat, for they are dying of hunger, he will bring up a thousand reasons for not understanding this save in accordance with his own selfish purposes. If we tell a backbiter that it is God's will that he love his neighbor as himself, he will become impatient and no reason will suffice to make him understand. We can tell a religious who has grown accustomed to freedom and comfort that he should remember his obligation to give good example and keep in mind that when he says these words they be not just words but be put into practice since he has promised them under oath; and that it is God's will that he be faithful to his vows and that he should note that if he gives scandal he is acting very contrary to them, even though he may not be breaking them entirely;",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,1,12,1,9,18,1,1,1,16,9,11,11,8,2,3,1,0,3,1,3
"137",1566,124,"and that since he has promised poverty, he should observe it without subterfuge, for this is what the Lord wills. But it is just useless to insist nowadays with some of them. What would happen if the Lord had not provided for us with the remedy He gave? There would have been only a very few who would have carried out these words He spoke for us to the Father, fiat voluntas tua.
Now then, once Jesus saw the need, He sought out a wonderful means by which to show the extreme of His love for us, and in His own name and in that of His brothers He made the following petition: ""Give us this day, Lord, our daily bread.""
Let us understand, Sisters, for the love of God, what our good Master is asking for; it is a matter of life and death not to pass over these words hastily. Consider what you have given as very little since you will receive so much.
2. Now I think -- unless one has a better opinion -- that Jesus observed what He had given for us, how important it was that we in turn give this, and the great difficulty there is in our doing so, as was said, since we are the way we are: inclined to base things and with so little love and courage that it was necessary for us to see His love and courage in order to be awakened -- and not just once but every day. After He saw all this, He must have resolved to remain with us here below. Since to do this was something so serious and important, He desired that it come from the hand of the Eternal Father. For even though they are one and He knew that what He did on earth God would do in heaven and consider good -- since His will and that of His Father were one -- the humility of Jesus was such that He wanted, as it were, to ask permission. He already knew that His Father loved Him and took His delight in Him. He well understood that He was asking for more in this request than He was in the others, for He knew beforehand the death they would make Him die and the dishonors and insults He would suffer.
3. Well, what father could there be, Lord, who in having given us his son, and a son like this who receives such treatment, would consent that he remain among us",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,10,3,5,21,0,1,2,10,8,14,4,4,3,2,1,1,1,5,1
"138",1566,125,"every day to suffer? Certainly no father, Lord, but Yours. You well know whom You are petitioning.
Oh, God help me, what great love from the Son and what great love from the Father! Yet I am not so surprised about Jesus, for since He had already said, fiat voluntas tua, He had to do that will, being who He is. Yes, for He is not like us! Since, then, He knows that He does it by loving us as Himself, He went about looking for ways of doing it with greater perfection, even though His fulfillment of this commandment was at a cost to Himself. But You, Eternal Father, how is it that You consented? Why do You desire to see Your Son every day in such wretched hands? Since You have already desired to see Him in these hands and given Your consent, You have seen how they treated Him. How can You in Your compassion now see Him insulted day after day? And how many insults will be committed today against this Most Blessed Sacrament! In how many enemies' hands must the Father see Him! How much irreverence from these heretics!
4. O eternal Lord! Why do You accept such a petition? Why do You consent to it? Don't look at His love for us, because in exchange for doing Your will perfectly, and doing it for us, He allows Himself to be crushed to pieces each day. It is for You, my Lord, to look after Him, since He will let nothing deter Him. Why must all our good come at His expense? Why does He remain silent before all and not know how to speak for Himself, but only for us? Well, shouldn't there be someone to speak for this most loving Lamb? [Allow me, Lord, to speak -- since You have willed to leave Him to our power -- and to beseech You since He so truly obeyed You and with so much love gave Himself to us.] I have noticed how in this petition alone He repeats the words: first He says and asks the Father to give us this daily bread, and then repeats, ""give it to us this day, Lord,"" invoking the Father again. It's as though Jesus tells the Father that He is now ours since the Father has given Him to us to die for us; and asks that the Father not take Him from us until the end of the world; that He allow Him to serve each",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,9,1,6,20,0,3,3,5,25,5,3,11,8,6,3,3,0,4,1
"139",1566,126,"day. May this move your hearts, my daughters, to love your Spouse, for there is no slave who would willingly say he is a slave, and yet it seems that Jesus is honored to be one.
5. O Eternal Father! How much this humility deserves! What treasure do we have that could buy Your Son? The sale of Him, we already know, was for thirty pieces of silver. But to buy Him, no price is sufficient. Since by sharing in our nature He has become one with us here below -- and as Lord of His own will -- He reminds the Father that because He belongs to Him the Father in turn can give Him to us. And so He says, ""our bread."" He doesn't make any difference between Himself and us, but we make one by not giving ourselves up each day for His Majesty. Don't be like some nuns that do nothing but promise; and since they don't keep anything, they say they didn't understand what they promised when they made profession. I believe this because it is easy to talk and difficult to act. And if they thought that words are equal to deeds, they certainly didn't understand. Make those who will profess vows here learn through a long trial period not to think their life will amount to words alone, without deeds also. So I want you to know whom you are dealing with, as they say, and what the good Jesus offers the Father through you and what you are giving when you pray that His will be done in you, for you are giving nothing else than that. In writing this I have felt the desire to know why, after the Lord said 'daily,' He then repeated by saying 'this day.' I want to tell you of my foolish reflections. If they are foolish, so be it because it is foolish enough of me to get involved in this explanation. But since we are learning about what we are asking for, let us think carefully about what it is so that, as I have said, we may appreciate its value and be thankful to Him who with so much care is teaching us. With regard to the unfortunate ones who will be condemned, who will not enjoy Him in the next life, He did all He could for their profit and to be with them on 'this day' of this life to strengthen them. If they let themselves be conquered, it will",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,6,6,0,6,21,0,0,1,17,12,9,9,2,0,7,1,1,3,1,1
"140",1566,127,"not be His fault. And so as to win consent from the Father, He reminds Him that it will be for only a day. reflect that this is a most advantageous hour for the soul, during which Jesus is very pleased if you keep Him company. Take great care, daughters, not to lose it. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your lordship. Blessed be God that you are in good health. May it please His Majesty that you continue to improve, as I beg him.
2. It would be a consolation for me if I had the time to write you at length, but I have so little that I didn't want to begin. María Bautista will give you news of me, since I cannot do so here in this letter. When she writes, she gives me the news that I desire and informs me about you, glory to God, and with this I can get along without seeing any letter from you. I have written some letters. With one of them, I already know that, for a certain reason, they did not give it to you; with the others I don't know what happened. I have received only one from you since I have been here. (I mean I received it in Salamanca).
3. I have already told the duchess what you directed me to tell her. She gave me an account of the matter and said that she had never thought you knew about the recent events. She certainly deserves that one not lose her friendship. Nor can I write to Señora Doña María. I kiss her ladyship's hands many times, but it seems to me that our Lady defends her daughters better than her ladyship does her subjects, judging from what they tell me about her silence in these matters. May the Lord help that little angel, for what he is doing for her is now something truly new in the world. I think this is the reason he has ordained that she find herself alone and with these struggles: that his favor toward her be better known. This makes me praise His Majesty greatly.
4. Now, since you have many saints there, you are beginning to recognize those who are not, and so you are forgetting me. Nonetheless, I believe that in heaven you will see that you owe the sinner more than you do them. I would be more willing to send best wishes to Señora Doña María and my lady",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,15,0,5,22,1,0,3,15,6,7,9,5,2,2,1,1,1,1,0

6. I beg you to inform me whether Father Visitator has given the permission for me to spend some days at St. Joseph's; the prioress will write to me. I don't say that you shouldn't recite vocal prayers (don't take me literally and say that I am dealing with contemplation -- unless the Lord places you in it), but that if you recite the Our Father you should understand how truly you are present with Him who taught it to you, kiss His feet in gratitude for it, and beg Him not to leave you. CHAPTER 34
 
Continues on the same subject. The matter is very helpful with regard to the time immediately following reception of the most Blessed Sacrament.
 
1. In this petition the word ""daily"" seems to mean forever. Reflecting upon why after the word ""daily"" the Lord said ""give us this day, Lord,"" that is, be ours every day, I've come to think that it is because here on earth we possess Him and also in heaven we will possess Him if we profit well by His company. He, in fact, doesn't remain with us for any other reason than to help, encourage, and sustain us in doing this will that we have prayed might be done in us.
2. In saying ""this day,"" it seems to me, He is referring to one day: that which lasts as long as the world and no longer. And one day indeed! With regard to the unfortunate ones who will be condemned (who will not enjoy Him in the next life), it will not be the Lord's fault if they let themselves be conquered. He doesn't stop encouraging them until the battle is over. They will have no excuse or complaint to make to the Father for taking Him away when they most need Him. So the Son tells His Father that because there is no more than one day the Father should let Him pass it in servitude. Since the Father has already given us His Son and, just because He wanted to, sent",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,13,0,4,13,0,1,0,10,8,9,16,6,0,4,1,2,1,2,0
"142",1566,129,"Him into the world, the Son, just because He wants to, desires not to abandon us but to remain here with us, to the greater glory of His friends and the affliction of His enemies. He asks again for no more than to be with us this day only, because it is a fact that He has given us this most sacred bread forever. His Majesty gave us, as I have said, the manna and nourishment of His humanity that we might find Him at will and not die of hunger, save through our own fault. In no matter how many ways the soul may desire to eat, it will find delight and consolation in the most Blessed Sacrament. [I don't want to think the Lord had in mind the other bread that is used for our bodily needs and nourishment; nor would I want you to have that in mind. The Lord was in the most sublime contemplation (for whoever has reached such a stage has no more remembrance that he is in the world than if he were not, however much there may be to eat), and would He have placed so much emphasis on the petition that He as well as ourselves eat? It wouldn't make sense to me. He is teaching us to set our wills on heavenly things and to ask that we might begin enjoying Him from here below; and would He get us involved in something so base as asking to eat? As if He didn't know us! For once we start worrying about bodily needs, those of the soul will be forgotten! Well, we are such temperate people that we are satisfied by little and ask for little! On the contrary, the more He gives us the more we think we are lacking everything, even water. Let those, my daughters, who want more than is necessary ask for this material bread.] There is no need or trial or persecution that is not easy to suffer if we begin to enjoy the delight and consolation of this sacred bread.
3. Ask the Father, daughters, together with the Lord, to give you your Spouse ""this day"" so that you will not be seen in this world without Him. To temper such great happiness it's sufficient that He remain disguised in these accidents of bread and wine. This is torment enough for anyone who has no other love than Him nor any other consolation. Beg Him not to fail you, and to give you",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,9,1,7,16,1,2,3,8,5,17,15,4,1,1,0,2,0,1,12
"143",1566,130,"the dispositions to receive Him worthily.
4. Don't worry about the other bread, those of you who have sincerely surrendered yourselves to the will of God. I mean during these times of prayer when you should be dealing with more important things; there are other times for working and for earning your bread. [Have no fear that you will be in want of bread if you are not wanting in what you have said about the surrender of yourselves to God's will. And indeed, daughters, I say for myself, if I should maliciously fail in this surrender, as I have many other times, I would not beg that He give me this bread or anything else to eat. Let me die of hunger; why should I want life if with it I am daily gaining more of eternal death?] Carefully avoid wasting your thoughts at any time on what you will eat. Let the body work, for it is good that you work to sustain yourselves; let your soul be at rest. Leave this care, as has been amply pointed out, to your Spouse; He will care for you always.
5. Your attitude should be like that of a servant when he begins to serve. His care is about pleasing his master in everything. But the master is obliged to provide his servant with food as long as the servant is in the house and serves him, unless the master is so poor that he doesn't have enough either for himself or for his servant. In our case this isn't so; the Master always is, and will be, rich and powerful. Well, it wouldn't be right for the servant to go about asking for food when he knows that the master of the house takes care of providing it for him, and must do so. The master would rightly tell his servant to be occupied in serving and seeking ways to please the master, for the servant, by worrying about what isn't his own business, would be doing everything wrong.
Thus, Sisters, let whoever wants be concerned with asking for this bread. As for ourselves, let us ask the Eternal Father that we might merit to receive our heavenly bread in such a way that the Lord may reveal Himself to the eyes of our soul and make Himself thereby known since our bodily eyes cannot delight in beholding Him, because He is so hidden. Such knowledge is another kind of satisfying and delightful sustenance that maintains life. [In order to",1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,3,7,2,6,18,4,0,1,6,5,16,9,6,2,2,0,4,2,0,11
"144",1566,131,"sustain life we will be desiring that other bread more often than we want and asking for it even without realizing we're doing so. There's no need to stir ourselves to ask for it; for our wretched tendency toward base things will awaken us, as I say, more often than we may desire. But let us watch so that we don't advertently place our care on anything other than begging the Lord for what I have mentioned; in having this, we will have everything.]
6. Do you think this heavenly food fails to provide sustenance, even for these bodies, that it is not a great medicine even for bodily ills? I know that it is. I know a person with serious illnesses, who often experiences great pain, who through this bread had them taken away as though by a gesture of the hand and was made completely well. This is a common experience, and the illnesses are very recognizable, for I don't think they could be feigned. And because the wonders this most sacred bread effects in those who worthily receive it are well known, I will not mention many that could be mentioned regarding this person I've spoken of. I was able to know of them, and I know that this is no lie. But the Lord had given her such living faith that when she heard some persons saying they would have liked to have lived at the time Christ our Good walked in the world, she used to laugh to herself. She wondered what more they wanted since in the most Blessed Sacrament they had Him just as truly present as He was then.
7. But I know that for many years, when she received Communion, this person, though she was not very perfect, strove to strengthen her faith so that in receiving her Lord it was as if, with her bodily eyes, she saw Him enter her house. Since she believed that this Lord truly entered her poor home, she freed herself from all exterior things when it was possible and entered to be Him. She strove to recollect the senses so that all of them would take notice of so great a good, I mean that they would not impede the soul from recognizing it. She considered she was at His feet and wept with the Magdalene, no more nor less than if she were seeing Him with her bodily eyes in the house of the Pharisee. And even though she didn't feel devotion, faith",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,2,12,0,4,21,0,0,2,21,6,12,13,7,5,4,2,8,6,0,4
"145",1566,132,"told her that He was indeed there.
8. If we don't want to be fools and blind the intellect there's no reason for doubt. Receiving Communion is not like picturing with the imagination, as when we reflect upon the Lord on the cross or in other episodes of the Passion, when we picture within ourselves how things happened to Him in the past. In Communion the event is happening now, and it is entirely true. There's no reason to go looking for Him in some other place farther away. Since we know that Jesus is with us as long as the natural heat doesn't consume the accidents of bread, we should approach Him. Now, then, if when He went about in the world the mere touch of His robes cured the sick, why doubt, if we have faith, that miracles will be worked while He is within us and that he will give what we ask of Him, since He is in our house? His Majesty is not accustomed to paying poorly for His lodging if the hospitality is good.
9. If it pains you not see Him with your bodily eyes, consider that seeing Him so is not fitting for us. To see Him in His glorified state is different from seeing Him as He was when he walked through this world. On account of our natural weakness there is no person capable of enduring such a glorious sight, nor would anyone in the world want to continue in it. In seeing this Eternal Truth one would see that all the things we pay attention to here below are lies and jokes. And in beholding such great Majesty, how would a little sinner like myself who has so much offended Him remain so close to Him? Beneath that bread He is easy to deal with. If a king were disguised it wouldn't matter to us at all if we conversed with him without so many gestures of awe and respect. It seems he would be obliged to put up with this lack since he is the one who disguised himself. Who would otherwise dare approach so unworthily, with so much lukewarmness, and with so many imperfections!
10. Oh, how we fail to know what we are asking for; and how His wisdom provided in a better way! He reveals Himself to those who He sees will benefit by His presence. Even though they fail to see Him with their bodily eyes, He has many methods of showing Himself to the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,2,1,4,4,0,9,17,2,2,2,10,10,17,13,6,14,0,1,4,5,1,2
"146",1566,133,"soul, through great interior feelings and through other different ways. Be with Him willingly; don't lose so good an occasion for conversing with Him as is the hour after having received Communion. If obedience should command something, Sisters, strive to leave your soul with the Lord. If you immediately turn your thoughts to other things, if you pay no attention and take no account of the fact that He is within you, how will He be able to reveal Himself to you? This, then, is a good time for our Master to teach us, and for us to listen to Him, kiss His feet because He wanted to teach us, and beg Him not to leave.
11. If you have to pray to Him by looking at His picture, it would seem to me foolish. You would be leaving the Person Himself in order to look at a picture of Him. Wouldn't it be silly if a person we love very much and of whom we have a portrait came to see us and we stopped speaking with him so as to carry on a conversation with the portrait? Do you want to know when it is very good to have a picture of Christ and when it is a thing in which I find much delight? When He himself is absent, or when by means of a great dryness He wants to make us feel He is absent. It is then a wonderful comfort to see an image of One whom we have so much reason to love. Wherever I turn my eyes, I would want to see His image. With what better or more pleasing thing can our eyes be occupied than with One who loves so much and who has in Himself all goods. Unfortunate are those heretics who through their own fault have lost this consolation among others.
12. But after having received the Lord, since you have the Person Himself present, strive to close the eyes of the body and open those of the soul and look into your own heart. For I tell you, and tell you again, and would like to tell you many times that you should acquire the habit of doing this every time you receive Communion and strive to have such a conscience that you will be allowed to enjoy this blessing frequently. Though He comes disguised, the disguise as I have said, does not prevent Him from being recognized in many ways, in conformity with the desire we have",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,2,8,0,5,18,0,0,2,11,7,17,9,3,14,3,3,6,0,4,0
"147",1566,134,"to see Him. And you can desire to see Him so much that He will reveal Himself to you entirely.
13. On the other hand, if we pay no attention to Him but after receiving Him leave Him and go seeking after other base things, what is there for Him to do? Must He force us to see Him, since He wants to reveal Himself to us? No, for they didn't treat Him so well when He let Himself be seen openly by all and told them clearly who He was; very few were those who believed Him. So His Majesty is being merciful enough to all of us who love Him, by letting us know that it is He who is present in the most Blessed Sacrament. He doesn't want to show Himself openly, communicate His grandeurs, and give His treasures except to those who He knows desire Him greatly; these are His true friends. I tell you that whoever is not His true friend and does not draw near to receive Him as such, by doing what lies in her power, will never trouble Him with requests that He reveal Himself. Such a person will hardly have fulfilled what the Church requires when she will leave and quickly forget what took place. Thus, such a person hurries on as soon as she can to other business affairs, occupations, and worldly impediments so that the Lord of the house may not occupy it.

CHAPTER 35
 
With a prayerful exclamation to the Eternal Father concludes the subject that was begun.
 
1. Because this matter is so important I have greatly enlarged upon it, even though in discussing the prayer of recollection I spoke of the significance of entering within ourselves to be alone with God. When you do not receive Communion, daughters, but hear Mass, you can make a spiritual communion. Spiritual communion is highly beneficial; through it you can recollect yourselves in the same way after Mass, for the love of this Lord is thereby deeply impressed on the soul. If we prepare ourselves to receive Him, He never fails to give in many ways which we do not understand. It is like approaching a fire; even though the fire may be a large one, it will not be able to warm you well if you turn away and hide your hands, though you will still get more heat than you would if you were in a place without one. But it is something else if we desire to",2,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,2,11,0,4,17,0,1,2,11,6,12,10,9,4,2,5,2,0,2,0
"148",1566,135,"approach Him. If the soul is disposed (I mean, if it wants to get warm), and if it remains there for a while, it will stay warm for many hours.
2. Now then, Sisters, consider that if in the beginning you do not fare well (for it could be that the devil will make you feel afflicted and constrained in heart since he knows the great damage that will be caused him by this recollection), the devil will make you think you find more devotion in others things and less in this recollection after Communion. Do not abandon this practice; the Lord will see in it how much you love Him. Remember that there are few souls who accompany Him and follow Him in trials. Let us suffer something for Him; His Majesty will repay you for it. Remember also how many persons there are who not only refuse to remain with Him but rudely reject Him. Well, we have to suffer something that He may understand we desire to see Him. And since He suffers and will suffer everything in order to find even one soul that will receive Him and lovingly keep Him within, let your desire be to do this. If there isn't anyone who will do it, the Eternal Father will rightly refuse to let Him remain with us. But the Father is so fond of friends and so much the Lord of His servants that in seeing the will of His good Son he doesn't want to hinder this excellent work; in it the Son's love for Him is fully demonstrated [by the invention of this admirable means in which He shows how much He loves us and helps us suffer our trials.]
3. Well, holy Father in heaven, since You desire and accept this work, and it is clear that You will not deny us anything that is good for us, there has to be someone, as I said in the beginning, who will speak for Your Son since he never looks out for Himself. Let us be the ones, daughters, even though the thought is a bold one, we being who we are. But obeying and trusting in the Lord's command to us that we ask, let us beseech His Majesty in the name of Jesus that, since nothing remained for Him to do and He left sinners a gift as great as this one, He might in His compassion desire and be pleased to provide a remedy that His Son may not",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,0,0,13,0,11,25,0,1,8,15,12,12,13,3,4,2,3,1,0,3,0
"149",1566,136,"be this badly treated. Let us beseech Him that, since His Son provided a means so good that we may offer Him many times in sacrifice, this precious gift may avail; that there'll be no advance made in the very great evil and disrespect committed and shown in places where this most Blessed Sacrament is present among those Lutherans, where churches are destroyed, so many priests lost, and the sacraments taken away.
4. Well, what is this, my Lord and my God! Either bring the world to an end or provide a remedy for these very serious evils. There is no heart that can suffer them, not even among those of us who are wretched. I beseech You, Eternal Father, that You suffer them no longer. Stop this fire, Lord, for if You will You can. Behold that Your Son is still in the world. Through His reverence may all these ugly and abominable and filthy things cease. In His beauty and purity He doesn't deserve to be in a house where there are things of this sort. Do not answer for our sakes, Lord; we not deserve it. Do it for Your Son's sake. We don't dare beseech You that He be not present with us; what would become of us? For if something appeases You, it is having a loved one like this here below. Since some means must be had, my Lord, may Your Majesty provide it.
5. O my God, would that I might have begged You much and served You diligently so as to be able to ask for this great favor in payment for my services, since You don't leave anyone without pay! But I have not done so, Lord; rather, perhaps I am the one who has angered You so that my sins have caused these many evils to come about. Well, what is there for me to do, my Creator, but offer this most blessed bread to You, and even though You have given it to us, return it to You and beg You through the merits of Your son to grant me this favor since in so many ways He has merited that You do so? Now, Lord; now; make the sea calm! May this ship, which is the Church, not always have to journey in a tempest like this. Save us, Lord, for we are perishing.

CHAPTER 36
 
Discusses these words of the Our Father: Dimitte nobis debita nostra.
 
1. Since our good Master saw that with this heavenly bread everything",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,3,18,0,11,20,0,6,3,4,8,6,16,5,2,0,1,1,0,1,2
"150",1566,137,"is easy for us, save through our own fault, and that we can carry out very well what we have said about the Father's will being done in us, He now tells the Father to forgive us our debts since we ourselves forgive. Thus, He says, going on with the prayer He teaches us, ""And forgive us, Lord, our debts as we forgive our debtors.""
2. Let us observe, Sisters, that he doesn't say ""as we will forgive."" We can thereby understand that whoever asks for a gift as great as the one last mentioned and whoever has already surrendered his will to God's will should have already forgiven. So, He says, ""as we forgive."" Thus, whoever may have said sincerely to the Lord fiat voluntas tua should have done that will entirely; at least have had the resolve to.
You see here why the saints were pleased with the wrongs and persecutions they suffered; they then had something to offer the Lord when they prayed to Him. What will someone as poor as I do, who has had so little to pardon and so much to be pardoned for?
This is a matter, Sisters, that we should reflect upon very much: that something so serious and important, as that our Lord forgive us our faults, which deserve eternal fire, be done by means of something so lowly as our forgiving others. And I have so little opportunity to offer even this lowly thing, that the Lord has to pardon me for nothing. [What can be said against someone like myself, or what wrong can be done to her who has deserved to be always mistreated by the demons? If the world were to treat me very badly, such mistreatment would be just. In sum, my Lord, I have nothing as a result to give You by means of which I may ask You to forgive my debts. May Your Son pardon me; no one has done me an injustice, and so I have nothing to pardon for your sake, unless, Lord, You accept my desire. It seems to be that anything I might forgive I would forgive in order that You would forgive me, or to do Your will unconditionally. Yet I don't know what I would do actually if I were condemned without fault. Now I see myself so deserving of blame in Your presence that everyone falls short with respect to blaming me; although those who do not know what I am, as You know, think they are",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,5,12,0,11,26,0,2,3,24,5,10,15,2,2,6,1,0,0,0,0
"151",1566,138,"offending me.] Here Your mercy fits in well. May You be blessed for putting up with one so poor as I. What Your Son says in the name of all has to exclude me because of what I am and because I am so penniless.
3. But, my Lord, are there some persons in my company who have not understood this? If there are, I beg them in Your name to remember this and pay no attention to the little things they call wrongs. It seems that, like children, we are making houses out of straw with these ceremonious little rules of etiquette. Oh, God help me, Sisters, if we knew what honor is and what losing honor consists in! Now I am not speaking of ourselves, for it would be quite bad for us not to have understood this yet, but of myself at the time when I prized honor without understanding what it was. I was following the crowd [through what I heard.] Oh, by how many things was I offended! I am ashamed now. Yet, I wasn't at that time one of those who pay close attention to these little rules of etiquette. But neither was I careful about the main rule, because I didn't consider or pay any heed to the honor that is beneficial; that is, the honor that benefits the soul. And how well it was said by whoever said it that honor and profit don't go together; although I don't know if it was said with this purpose in mind. But it is right to the point because the soul's profit and what the world calls honor can never go together. It's a frightful thing; the world moves in the opposite direction. Blessed be the Lord who drew us out of it. [May it please His Majesty that such a concept of honor always be as far from this house as it is now. God deliver us from monasteries where they pay attention to these ceremonious little rules. He is never much honored in such monasteries. God help me, what great foolishness, that religious seek honor in such trifles; I am astonished! You don't know about this, Sisters, but I want to tell you about it so that you will guard yourselves against it.]
4. But consider, Sisters, that the devil hasn't forgotten us. He also invents his own honors in monasteries and establishes his own laws. There, people ascend and descend in rank just as in the world. Those with degrees must",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,7,14,0,9,24,2,2,1,13,8,6,10,5,0,6,0,0,0,0,0
"152",1566,139,"follow in order, according to their academic titles. Why? I don't know. The one who has managed to become professor of theology must not descend to professor of philosophy, for it is a point of honor that he must ascend and not descend. Even if obedience should command, he would consider the change an affront. And there will always be someone standing by to defend him and tell him that it's an insult; then the devil at once discloses reasons why even according to God's law this thinking seems right. Well, now, among ourselves: the one who has been prioress must remain ineligible for any lower office; a preoccupation about who the senior is -- for we never forget this -- and we even think at times we gain merit by such concern because the order commands it.
5. One doesn't know whether to laugh or to cry; the latter would be more fitting. The order doesn't command us to lack humility. It commands that there be a balanced arrangement of things, but I don't have to be so careful about this arrangement when it comes to matters of self-esteem that I am as concerned about these little ceremonious rules as about other practices that perhaps we observe imperfectly. All of our perfection doesn't consist in the observance of what has to do with our honor. Others will look after me if I forget about myself. The fact is that since we are inclined to ascend -- even though we will not ascend to heaven by such an inclination -- there must be no descending. O Lord, Lord! Are You our Model and Master? Yes, indeed! Well then, what did Your honor consist of, You who honored us? Didn't you indeed lose it in being humiliated unto death? No, Lord, but You won it for all.
6. Oh, for the love of God, Sisters, how we get lost on the road because we start out wrong from the beginning. Please God no soul will be lost because it keeps these miserable little rules of etiquette without understanding what honor consists in. And then we shall reach the point of thinking that we have done a great deal if we pardon one of these little things that was neither an offense, nor an injury, nor anything. Like someone who has accomplished something, we shall think that the Lord pardons us because we have pardoned others. Help us understand, my God, that we do not know ourselves and that we come to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,0,0,12,1,11,17,2,3,6,14,11,11,11,13,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
"153",1566,140,"You with empty hands; and pardon us through Your mercy. [Indeed, You are always the wronged and the offended one.] Truly, Lord, since all things come to an end, but the punishment is without end, I don't see anything that would give us a reason to remind You to grant us so great a favor; unless You would grant it because of Your Son who asks it of You.
7. But yet, how the Lord must esteem this love we have for one another! Indeed, Jesus could have put other virtues first and said: forgive us, Lord, because we do a great deal of penance or because we pray much and fast or because we have left all for You and love You very much. He didn't say forgive us because we would give up our lives for You, or, as I say, because of other possible things. But He said only, ""forgive us because we forgive."" Perhaps He said the prayer and offered it on our behalf because He knows we are so fond of this miserable honor and that to be forgiving is a virtue difficult for us to attain by ourselves but most pleasing to His Father.
8. Well, consider carefully, Sisters, that He says, ""as we forgive,"" as though it were something already being done, as I have mentioned. And pay very close attention, for when among the favors God grants in the prayer of perfect contemplation that I mentioned there doesn't arise in the soul a very resolute desire to pardon any injury however grave it may be and to pardon it in deed when the occasion arises, do not trust much in that soul's prayer. And I don't refer to these nothings that they call injuries. For the soul God brings to Himself in so sublime a contemplation is not touched by these wrongs nor does it care at all whether it is esteemed or not. I didn't say this well, ""nor does it care at all,"" for it is much more afflicted by honor than by dishonor and by a lot of ease and rest than by trials. For when truly the Lord has given His kingdom here below, the soul no longer desires honor in this world. And so as to reign more sublimely it understands that the above-mentioned way is the true way; it has already seen through experience the great gain and progress that comes to it by suffering for God. Very seldom does God give such great gifts, save",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,18,1,9,33,1,2,4,15,11,7,12,12,2,7,2,1,2,2,0
"154",1566,141,"to persons who have willingly undergone many trials for Him. As I have said in another part of this book, the trials of contemplatives are great, and so the Lord looks for contemplatives among people who have been tested.
9. Now then, Sisters, realize that since these contemplative already know what everything is worth, they are not long delayed by a passing thing. If at first a great affront or trial causes pain, their reason comes to their rescue, before the pain is fully felt, with another consideration as if to raise the banner and almost annihilate the pain by means of joy. This joy comes from their seeing that the Lord has placed in their hands something by which they will gain more graces and perpetual favors from His Majesty than they would in ten years through trials they might wish to undertake on their own. This is very common from what I understand, for I have dealt with many contemplatives and am certain that this is what happens. Just as others prize gold and jewels, they prize trials and desire them; they know that these latter are what will make them rich.
10. Self-esteem is far removed from these persons. They like others to know about their sins and like to tell about them when they see themselves esteemed. The same is true in matters concerning their lineage. They already know that in the kingdom without end they will have nothing to gain from this. If they should happen to be pleased to be of good descent, it's when this would be necessary in order to serve God. When it isn't, it grieves them to be taken for more than what they are; and without any grief at all but gladly they disillusion others. So it is with those to whom God grants the grace of this humility and great love for Himself. In what amounts to His greater service, they are already so forgetful of self that they can't even believe that others feel some things and consider them an affront.
11. These effects I just mentioned are found in persons who are closer to perfection and whom the Lord very habitually favors by bringing to Himself through perfect contemplation. But of the first effect, which is the resolve to suffer wrongs and suffer them even though this may be painful, I say that it will soon be possessed by anyone who has from the Lord this favor of the prayer of union. If one doesn't experience these",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,8,2,11,24,0,0,5,21,6,9,12,7,3,2,3,1,4,1,0
"155",1566,142,"effects and come away from prayer fortified in them, one may believe that the favor was not from God but an illusion, or the devil's gift bestowed so that we might consider ourselves more honored.
12. It can happen that in the beginning when the Lord grants these favors the soul will not immediately experience this fortitude. But I say that in a short while if He continues to grant them, it will have fortitude in this virtue of forgiving others even though it may not have fortitude in other virtues. I cannot believe that a person who comes so close to Mercy itself, where he realizes what he is and the great deal God has pardoned him of, would fail to pardon his offender immediately, in complete ease, and with a readiness to remain on very good terms with him. Such a person is mindful of the gift and favor granted by God, by which he saw signs of great love; and he rejoices that an opportunity is offered whereby he can show the Lord some love.
13. I repeat that I know many persons whom the Lord has favored by raising to supernatural things, giving them this prayer or contemplation that was mentioned and, even though I see other faults and imperfections in them, I have never seen anyone with this one; nor do I believe that such a fault will be present if the favors are from God, as I have said. The one who receives greater favors should observe whether these effects are increasing within him. If he doesn't see any increase, he should be afraid and refuse to believe that these gifts are from God, as I have said. For God's favor always enriches the soul it reaches. This is certain. Although the favor and gift passes quickly, it is gradually recognized through the benefits the soul receives. Since Jesus knows this well, He says resolutely to His holy Father that ""we pardon our debtors."" For it seems they want to cast Him out of the world by tearing down sacred buildings, killing so many priests, profaning so many churches -- even Christians sometimes go to church more with the intention of offending Him than of worshiping Him. Blessed be God! Such a thing does not apply to this house. To say it does would be untrue because the one who has been prioress is the one who afterward humbles herself most. But I say this because it is so common in other monasteries that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,27,1,8,26,1,3,1,15,6,8,14,4,4,6,0,0,0,2,0
"156",1566,143,"I fear the devil will tempt us in this way. I consider it so dangerous that, please God, no soul ... CHAPTER 37
 
Speaks of the excellence of this prayer, the Our Father, and of how we shall in many ways find consolation in it.
 
1. We ought to give great praise to the Lord for the sublime perfection of this evangelical prayer. Each of us, daughters, can apply the prayer to her own needs since it was composed by such a good Master. I marvel to see that in so few words everything about contemplation and perfection is included; it seems we need to study no other book than this one. Up to now the Lord has taught us the whole way of prayer and of high contemplation, from the beginning stages to mental prayer, to the prayer of quiet, and to that of union; so much so that, if I knew how to explain the matter, a large book on prayer could be written based on this genuine foundation. From here on, the Lord begins to teach us about the effects of His favors, as you have seen.
2. I have wondered why His Majesty did not explain more about these sublime and obscure things that we might all know about them. It has seemed to me that since this prayer was intended for general use so that each one could petition according to his own intention, be consoled, and think that he has a good understanding of the prayer, the Lord left it in this obscure form. Contemplatives and persons already very much committed to God, who no longer desire earthly things, ask for the heavenly favors that can, through God's goodness, be given on earth. Those who still live on earth, and it is good that they live in conformity with their state in life, may ask also for bread. They must be sustained and must sustain their households. Such a petition is very just and holy, and so also is their petition for other things according to their needs.
3. But both should consider that two of the things mentioned pertain to all; giving Him our will and forgiving others. True, there is a more and a less in the degree to which this is done, as has been said. The perfect will give their will in the way perfect souls do and forgive with that perfection that was mentioned. We, Sisters, will do what we can; the Lord receives everything. It seems that on",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,1,0,24,0,3,20,1,1,0,19,11,11,9,13,2,3,0,0,1,0,1
"157",1566,144,"our behalf He makes a kind of pact with His Eternal Father, like one who says: ""You do this, Lord, and My brothers will do that."" Well, surely He doesn't fail to do His part. Oh, oh, how well He pays! And He pays without measure!
4. We can say this prayer only once in such a way that the Lord will enrich us since He sees that we do so sincerely and are determined to do what we say. He likes us to be truthful with Him. If we speak plainly and clearly so that we don't say one thing and than act differently, He always gives more than what we ask of Him.
Our good Master knows this well. He knows that those who ask with perfection will be filled with such favors from His Father that they will reach a high state. In fact, those who are already perfect or those who are approaching it are not afraid of anything, nor should they be, since they have trampled the world underfoot, as the saying goes. The Lord of the world is pleased with them, and they have the greatest hope of this in the effects of the favors He grants them. Absorbed in these delights they don't want to remember even that there is a world or that they have enemies.
5. O Eternal Wisdom! O good Teacher! What a wonderful thing it is, daughters, to have a wise and cautious teacher who foresees the dangers. This is the entire good that a spiritual soul can desire here below because it provides great security. One could not exaggerate the importance of this. Thus since the Lord sees that it is necessary to awaken and remind us that we have enemies, that it is very dangerous to be negligent with regard to these enemies, and that we need much more help from the Eternal Father because our fall will be from a higher place, and so that we do not go about mistaken and without self-knowledge, He makes the following petitions so necessary for all as long a we live in this exile: ""And lead us not, Lord, into temptation; but deliver us from evil.""

CHAPTER 38
 
Deals with the great need we have to beseech the Eternal Father to grant us what we ask for in the words, Et ne nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo; and explains some temptations. The subject matter is important.
 
1. We have great things to think about and understand here,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,2,8,0,9,28,1,6,1,9,12,9,6,11,2,6,0,0,0,0,0
"158",1566,145,"Sisters, because these things are what we are asking for. Now see, I am certain that those who reach perfection do not ask the Lord to free them from trials or temptations or persecutions or struggles. This is another very great and certain effect of the contemplation and the favors His Majesty gives, and of the Lord's Spirit rather than an illusion. On the contrary, as I have said a little while ago, these persons desire, ask for, and love trials. They are like soldiers who are happier when there are more wars because they then hope to earn more. If there is no war, they receive their wages but realize they won't get rich.
2. Believe, Sisters, that the soldiers of Christ, those who experience contemplation and engage in prayer, are eager to fight. They never fear public enemies very much; they already recognized them and know that these enemies have no power against the strength the Lord gives and that they themselves always come out the victors and with much gain. They never turn from these enemies. Those whom they fear -- and it is right they fear and always ask the Lord to be freed from them -- are the traitorous enemies, the devils who transfigure themselves into angels of light, who come disguised. Not until they have done much harm to the soul do they allow themselves to be recognized. They suck away our blood and destroy our virtues, and we go about in the midst of the same temptation but do not know it. With regard to these enemies, daughters, let us ask and often beg the Lord in the Our Father to free us and not let us walk into temptation, so that they will not draw us into error or hide the light and truth from us, that the poison will be discovered. Oh, how rightly does our good Master ask this for us and teach us to ask for it.
3. Consider, daughters, the many ways these enemies can cause harm. Don't think they do so only by making us suppose that the delights and consolations they can feign in us are from God. This seems to me the least harm -- in part -- they can cause; rather, it could be that by means of this they will make one advance more quickly. For, in being fed on that delight, such a person will spend more hours in prayer. Since he doesn't know that the delight is from the devil and",1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,5,14,1,21,22,4,12,0,15,10,6,9,8,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
"159",1566,146,"since he sees he is unworthy of those consolations, he doesn't stop thanking God. He will feel greater obligation to serve Him and, thinking the favors come from the hand of the Lord, he will strive to dispose himself so that God will grant him more.
4. Strive always, Sisters, for humility and to see that you are unworthy of these favors; do not seek them. I hold that the devil loses many souls who strive for this humility. He thinks he is going to bring them to perdition, but the Lord draws good from the evil the devil aims at. His Majesty looks at our intention, which is to please and serve Him and remain with Him in prayer; and the Lord is faithful. It's good to be on one's guard lest there be a break in humility, or some vainglory emerge. If you beseech the Lord to free you from this, do not fear, daughters, that His Majesty will allow you to be favored very much by anyone other than Himself.
5. The way the devil can do a great deal of harm, without our realizing it, is to make us believe we have virtues when we do not. This is a pestilence. In regard to the delights and consolations, it seems merely that we are receiving and that we have the greater obligation to serve. In regard to our thinking we are virtuous, it seems we are serving and giving and that the Lord is obliged to pay. Thus little by little this latter notion does great harm. On the one hand it weakens humility, and on the other hand we grow careless about acquiring that virtue we think we have already acquired. Well, what is the remedy, Sisters? That which seems best to me is what our Master teaches us: prayer and supplication to the Eternal Father not to let us enter into temptation.
6. I also want to tell you something else. If it seems the Lord has already given us virtue, let us understand that actually it has been received and that He can take it away, as in fact often happens, but not without His wonderful providence. Haven't you ever seen this for yourselves, Sisters? I have. Sometimes I think I am very detached; and as a matter of fact when put to the test, I am. At another time I will find myself so attached, and perhaps to things that the day before I would have made fun of, that I almost don't",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,15,0,10,20,1,1,1,14,6,4,14,4,4,0,4,3,1,0,0
"160",1566,147,"know myself. At other times I think I have great courage and that I wouldn't turn from anything of service to God; and when put to the test, I do have this courage for some things. Another day will come in which I won't find the courage in me to kill even an ant for God if in doing so I'd meet with any opposition. In like manner it seems to me that I don't care at all about things or gossip said of me; and when I'm put to the test this is at times true -- indeed I am pleased about what they say. Then there come days in which one word alone distresses me, and I would want to leave the world because it seems everything is a bother to me. And I am not alone in this. I have noticed it in many persons better than I, and know that it so happens.
7. Now since this is true, who will be able to say of himself that he is virtuous or rich? For at the very moment when there is need of virtue one finds oneself poor. No, Sisters; but let us always think we are poor, and not go into debt when we do not have the means with which to repay. The treasure will have to come from elsewhere, and we do not know when the Lord will want to leave us in the prison of our misery without giving us anything. And if others in thinking that we are good, bestow favor and honor on us -- which is the borrowing I mentioned -- both they and we ourselves will have been fooled. True, if we serve with humility, the Lord in the end will succor us in our needs; but if this poverty of spirit is not genuinely present at every step, as they say, the Lord will abandon us. And this abandonment by the Lord is one of His greatest favors, for He does it so that we might be humble and understand in truth that we have nothing we haven't received.
8. Now, then, take note of some other advice: the devil makes us think we have a virtue, let's say of patience because we resolve and make very frequent acts of willingness to suffer much for God, and it seems to us as a matter of fact that we would suffer much; so we are very satisfied, for the devil helps us to believe this. I advise you",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,6,10,1,14,25,2,2,7,17,5,11,15,10,0,5,0,0,0,0,0
"161",1566,148,"not to pay any attention to these virtues; let us neither think we know them other than by name nor, until we see the proof, think the Lord has given them to us. For it will happen that with one displeasing word spoken to you, your patience will go tumbling to the ground. When you suffer often, praise God that He is beginning to teach you this virtue of patience and strive to endure, for the suffering is a sign that in this way He wants you to pay for the virtue. He gives it to you, and you do not possess it save as though on deposit, as has already been said.
9. The devil brings about another temptation. We think we are very poor in spirit and have the habit of saying that we don't desire anything or that we couldn't care less about anything. But hardly does the occasion arise to receive a gift -- even if it would be more than we need -- than our poverty of spirit is completely ruined. So often do we say we have this virtue that we end up believing we have it.
Great is the importance of always being careful to understand this temptation, both in the things I have mentioned as well as in many others. For when the Lord truly gives one of these solid virtues, it seems it carries all the others in its wake. This is something felt very clearly. But I again warn you that even though it seems you possess it, you should fear lest you be mistaken. The truly humble person always walks in doubt about his own virtues, and usually those he sees in his neighbors seem more certain and more valuable.

CHAPTER 39
 
Continues the same subject, gives advice about some different kinds of temptations, and sets down two remedies by which to free oneself from them.
 
1. Now be also on your guard, daughters, against some types of humility given by the devil in which great disquiet is felt about the gravity of our sins. This disturbance can afflict in many ways even to the point of making one give up receiving Communion and practicing private prayer. These things are given up because the devil makes one feel unworthy. And when such persons approach the Blessed Sacrament, the time they used to spend in receiving favors is now spent in wondering whether or not they are well prepared. The situation gets so bad that the soul thinks God has abandoned",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,8,14,0,13,22,3,0,4,15,4,8,18,9,2,4,3,1,0,0,0
"162",1566,149,"it because of what it is; it almost doubts His mercy. Everything it deals with seems dangerous, and what it uses, however good, seems fruitless. It feels such distrust of itself that it folds its arms and remains idle; what is good in others seems evil when the soul sees it within its own self.
2. Consider carefully, daughters, the matter I'm going to speak to you about, for sometimes it will be through humility and virtue that you hold yourselves to be so wretched, and at other times it will be a gross temptation. I know of this because I have gone through it. Humility does not disturb or disquiet or agitate, however great it may be; it comes with peace, delight, and calm. Even though a person upon seeing himself so wretched understands clearly that he merits to be in hell, suffers affliction, thinks everyone should in justice abhor him, and almost doesn't dare ask for mercy, his pain, if the humility is genuine, comes with a sweetness in itself and a satisfaction that he wouldn't want to be without. The pain of genuine humility doesn't agitate or afflict the soul; rather, this humility expands it and enables it to serve God more. The other type of pain disturbs everything, agitates everything, afflicts the entire soul, and is very painful. I think the devil's aim is to make us think we are humble and, in turn, if possible, make us lose confidence in God.
3. When you find yourselves in this condition, stop thinking about your misery, insofar as possible, and turn your thoughts to the mercy of God, to how He loves us and suffered for us. And if you are undergoing a temptation, you will not even be able to do this, for the devil will not let you quiet your mind or concentrate on anything unless so as to tire you all the more. It will be enough if you recognize that this is a temptation.
Likewise he tempts us in regard to excessive penances so that we might think we are more penitential than others and are doing something. If you hide them from your confessor or prioress, of if when told to stop you do not do so, you are clearly undergoing a temptation. Strive to obey, even if this may be more painful for you, since the greatest perfection lies in obedience.
4. The devil sets up another dangerous temptation: self-assurance in the thought that we will in no way return to our past",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,14,0,25,14,4,9,4,18,9,11,26,9,2,2,1,1,6,1,1
"163",1566,150,"faults and worldly pleasures: ""for now I have understood the world and know that all things come to an end and that the things of God give me greater delight."" If this self-assurance is present in beginners, it is very dangerous because with it a person doesn't take care against entering once more into the occasions of sin, and he falls flat; please God the relapse will not bring about something much worse. For since the devil sees that he is dealing with a soul that can do him harm and bring profit to others, he uses all his power so that it might not rise.
Thus, however many delights and pledges of love the Lord gives you, never proceed with such self-assurance that you stop fearing lest you fall again; and be on guard against the occasions of sin.
5. Strive, without hiding anything, to discuss these favors and consolations with someone who will enlighten you. And take care about this: however sublime the contemplation, let your prayer always begin and end with self-knowledge. And if the favor is from God, even though you may not want to follow the advice, you will still follow it most of the time because God's favor brings humility and always leaves greater light that we may understand the little that we are.
I don't want to enlarge on this any more, for you will find many books with such advice. I have said what I did because I have experienced it and found myself in trouble at times. All that we say, however much it is, cannot give us complete security.
6. Thus, Eternal Father, what can we do but have recourse to You and pray that these enemies of ours not lead us into temptation? Let public enemies come, for by Your favor we will be more easily freed. But these other treacheries; who will understand them, my God? We always need to pray to You for a remedy. Instruct us, Lord, so that we may understand ourselves and be secure. You already know that few take this path; but if they have to travel it with so many fears, many fewer will take it.
7. What a strange thing! It's as though the devil tempts only those who take the path of prayer. And everyone is more surprised by a mistake of one of those who are nearing perfection than by the public mistakes and sins of a hundred thousand others. With these latter mistakes there is no need to consider whether they",2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,1,17,0,18,18,2,3,0,11,8,10,12,9,1,2,0,0,0,1,0
"164",1566,151,"are good or bad, for from a thousand-leagues distance one recognizes that they come from Satan.
As a matter of fact people are right in being surprised, for among those who recite the Our Father as was explained there are so very few deceived by the devil that as something new and unusual their mistake causes surprise. It is something very common among mortals that they pass over easily what they continually see, and wonder about what seldom or almost never happens. And the devil himself causes them to be surprised, for this surprise is to his advantage; he loses many souls through one who reaches perfection. [And I say that this is so surprising I do not marvel that others are surprised. Unless it is very much due to their own fault, souls who practice prayer walk so much more securely than those who take another road. They are like those in the stands watching the bull in comparison with one who is right in front of its horns. I have heard this comparison, and it seems to me true to the letter.
Do not fear, Sisters, to travel these paths, for in prayer there are many. Some souls profit by one path, and others by another, as I have said. Prayer is a safe road; you will be more quickly freed from temptation when close to the Lord than when far. Beseech Him and ask Him to deliver you from evil as you do so often each day in the Our Father.] for if I had not written about it elsewhere -- and also so as not to go on at greater length, which would be a bother -- a large book on prayer could be written ... Blessed be His name forever and ever, amen! And I ask the Eternal Father through Him to forgive my debts and great sins -- for I have had no one nor anything to forgive, and every day I have something that needs to be forgiven -- and give me grace so that one day I may have something to offer with my petition. That we might in some way appear to be sons of such a Father and brothers of such a Brother, Jesus taught us this sublime way of prayer and petitioned that we be angelic beings in this exile -- provided that we strive with every effort to make our deeds conform to our words. We may thus know that if, as I mention, we do what we",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,2,17,1,10,22,1,2,1,8,4,6,19,8,2,3,0,0,0,0,0
"165",1566,152,"say, the Lord will not fail to accomplish what we ask, will give us His kingdom, and help with supernatural things (the prayer of quiet and perfect contemplation and the other favors the Lord grants us in such prayer in return for our efforts). Everything is small as far as what we can strive for and obtain on our own. But since this is what we ourselves can do, very certainly the Lord will help us because His Son asks this for us. For without our realizing it, while it seems to us that we are proceeding safely, we cause ourselves to fall into a pit we cannot escape from. Although it may not always be a matter of a known mortal sin which would bring us to hell, it will weaken our legs along this road I began to tell you about -- for I have not forgotten. Well you know how a person advances when he's bogged in a pit: his life ends there, and he will be doing enough if he doesn't keep from sinking lower, on into hell; he never improves. Since he doesn't improve, being there is of benefit neither to himself nor to others; rather, it does harm. For since the pit is dug out, many others who go along the way can also fall into it. If he gets out and covers it over with dirt, he does no harm to himself or to others. But I tell you that this temptation is very dangerous; I know much about it through experience, and so I am able to tell you about it; although not as well as I should like.

The devil makes you think you are poor and makes even others who practice prayer think this of themselves. And he is somewhat right because you have promised poverty -- orally, that is. I say orally, for it is impossible that, if with the heart we understand what we promise and then promise it, the devil could draw us for twenty years and even our whole lives into this temptation; 'impossible,' because we would see that we are deceiving the world and our own selves.

Well now, someone thinking he is poor or after having promised poverty will say: 'I don't want anything; I have this because I can't get along without it; the fact is I have to live in order to serve God. God wants us to care for these bodies.' The devil, like an angel, teaches a thousand different kinds",2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,15,1,12,17,0,3,2,10,11,12,10,6,1,4,0,3,2,0,0
"166",1566,153,"of things here -- for all these things are good -- and so he makes the soul think it is already poor and has this virtue, that everything is accomplished. Now let us come to the test; for this deception of the devil is not recognized in any other way than by always checking carefully one's attitudes; and if care is taken a sign will be given very soon: the person has more income than he needs (I mean than he really needs, that if he can manage with one servant he not have three); someone brings a lawsuit against him for some of it, or a poor peasant fails to pay his rent, and the person becomes so disturbed and makes such a big issue of it that one would think he couldn't live without the money. He will say that he has to be a good administrator -- for there is always some excuse. I don't say that he should give everything up but that he should strive to know whether what he is doing is good or not. For the truly poor person holds these things in so little esteem that, though for some reason he obtains them, they are never the cause of disturbance; he never thinks he will be in want. And if he does lack something, he doesn't care much; he considers this an accessory and not the main thing. Since he has higher thoughts, only reluctantly does he become involved with money.

If he is a religious, whether man or woman (for it is already verified that such a person is religious, at least should be), he may not have anything because sometimes nobody gives him anything. But if somebody gives him something, it's a wonder if he thinks it to be more than enough. He always likes to hold on to something. If he can have a habit made out of fine cloth he doesn't ask for one from rough cloth. He keeps some little things he can pawn or sell, even though they may be books; for if a sickness comes he will need more comfort than usual.

Sinner that I am! Here now; is that what you promised? Forget yourselves and surrender to God come what may. If you go about providing for the future, it would be better for you to have a fixed revenue. Even though this may be done without sin, it's good that we understand these imperfections so as to see that we are far from",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,1,11,7,0,6,14,3,0,1,14,7,20,31,9,1,2,1,0,1,0,0
"167",1566,154,"having this virtue; and we may then ask for it from God and strive for it. In thinking that we have it, we become careless and mistaken, which is worse.

This also happens to us in regard to humility: it seems to us we don't want honor or that we couldn't care less about anything. The occasion arises in which a point of honor is at stake, and at once, in what you feel and do, you realize that you are not humble. For if something brings you more honor, you do not renounce it -- nor do those we mentioned even who are poor in spirit -- for the sake of growing more in humility. And please God they will not go seeking out honor! And so often do some repeat that they don't want anything or care about anything that as a matter of fact they think this is so. Even the habit of saying it makes them believe it more. Well be on guard, daughters, against some humble thoughts, caused by the devil, with their great disquiet over the seriousness of past sins, about whether I deserve to approach Communion or whether I have prepared myself well or about my unworthiness to live with good people; things of this sort. When such thoughts come with quiet, calm, and delight, they should be esteemed because they bring self-knowledge. But if they come with agitation, disquiet, and oppression of soul, and if the mind cannot be quieted, believe that they are a temptation and don't consider yourselves humble; humility doesn't come in this way. To my Most Reverend Señor and Padre Maestro Domingo Báñez, my lord.
1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and with my soul. There is no reason to be amazed at anything that is done for love of God, for my love for Fray Domingo is such that whatever seems good to him seems so to me and what he wants, I want as well. I don't know where such enchantment will end.
2. Your Parda has made us happy. She is so outside herself with joy since her entrance that it makes us praise God. I don't think I will have the heart to take her as a lay sister, knowing how you have helped her. So, I have decided that they teach her how to read and on the basis of her progress we will make our decision.
3. My spirit has well understood hers even though I have",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,15,0,7,25,0,1,0,20,11,10,23,1,0,3,1,1,0,2,0
"168",1566,155,"not spoken to her. And there is a nun who cannot resist the deep prayer that this new sister stirs in her. Believe me, mi padre, it is a pleasure for me every time I accept someone who brings in nothing and is received for love of God alone; otherwise those who don't have anything would have to renounce their vocation for lack of means. I see that God does me a special favor allowing me to be a means to their salvation. If I could accept all in this way, I would be overjoyed. But I don't recall ever having refused anyone pleasing to me because she didn't have a dowry.
4. It made me particularly happy to see how God grants you such great favors as to use you in works like this of sending us a postulant. You have become the father of those of little means, and the charity the Lord gives you for this work makes me so happy that I will do anything I can to help you in deeds of this kind. But the flood of tears of the one who accompanied her! I thought it would never end. I don't know why you sent her here to me.
5. Father Visitator has given the permission, and it is the beginning of more to come with the help of God. And perhaps I will be able to accept the whimpering one, if it should please you. But I have too many for Segovia.
6. Parda found a good father when she found you. She says that she still doesn't believe she is living in our house. Her happiness is something to praise God for. I praised him also on seeing your little nephew who came with Doña Beatriz, and I rejoiced in meeting him. Why didn't you tell me beforehand?
7. It also pleases me that our new sister lived with my saintly friend. My friend's sister writes to me making generous offers of help. I tell you I have been deeply touched. It seems I love my friend much more than I did when she was alive.
8. You will have already heard that you received a vote for prior at San Esteban; the present prior received all the rest. I was edified to see such unanimity. Yesterday I was with a padre named Fray Melchor Cano, who is from your order. I tell you that if there were many spirits in your order like his, they could found some contemplative monasteries.
9. I wrote to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,14,1,2,26,0,0,2,17,9,10,11,5,4,3,1,0,2,2,0
"169",1566,156,"Avila that those wanting to make such a foundation should not lose heart if they don't find the means here, for I have a great desire that there be a beginning. Why don't you tell me what you have done? May God make you as holy as I desire. I want to speak to you some day about those fears you have; they only make you waste time, and for want of humility you don't believe me. Fray Melchor does better, for after I spoke with him in Avila, he says, it benefited him and he doesn't believe an hour passes that he doesn't think of me. Oh, what a spirit, and what a soul God has in him! I was highly consoled by him. It seems I have nothing more to do than tell you about the spirit of others. Remain with God and beg him to give me a spirit that will never stray in any matter concerning his will.
It is Sunday night.
Your honor's daughter and servant,
Teresa of Jesus CHAPTER 40
 
Tells how by striving always to walk in the love and the fear of God we will proceed safely among so many temptations.
 
1. Now then, Good Master, teach us how to live without any sudden assault in so dangerous a war. What we can have, daughters, and what His Majesty gave us are love and fear. Love will quicken our steps; fear will make us watch our steps to avoid falling along the way. On this way there are many stumbling blocks for all of us who are alive and continue our journey. With this fear we will be secure against being deceived.
2. You will ask me how you can tell if you have these two virtues which are so great; and you are right in doing so, for you cannot be very certain and definite about them. If we possess love, we are certainly in the state of grace. But reflect, Sisters, that there are some signs that even the blind, it seems, see. They are manifest signs, though you may not want to recognize them. They cry out loudly, for not many possess them perfectly; and hence these signs are more obvious. Love and fear of God: what more could you ask for! They are like two fortified castles from which one can wage war on the world and the devils.
3. Those who truly love God, love every good, desire every good, favor every good, praise every good. They always join, favor,",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,14,3,14,29,7,4,2,9,10,12,11,14,3,4,0,1,2,7,0
"170",1566,157,"and defend good people. They have no love for anything but truth and whatever is worthy of love. Do you think it is possible for a person who really loves God to love vanities? No, indeed, he cannot; nor can he love riches, or worldly things, or delights, or honors, or strife, or envy. All of this is so because he seeks only to please the Beloved. These persons go about dying so that their Beloved might love them, and thus they dedicate their lives to learning how they might please Him more. Hide itself? Oh, with regard to the love of God -- if it is genuine love -- this is impossible. If you don't think so, look at St. Paul or the Magdalene. Within three days the one began to realize that he was sick with love; that was St. Paul. The Magdalene knew from the first day; and how well she knew! Love has this characteristic: it can be greater or lesser in degree. Thus, the love makes itself known according to its intensity. When slight, it shows itself but slightly; when strong, it shows itself strongly. But where there is love of God, whether little or great, it is always recognized.
4. However, the things with which we are now dealing more specifically, the deceptions and illusions the devil brings on contemplatives, are not few. With contemplatives there is always much love, or they wouldn't be contemplatives; and so their love is clearly recognized and in many ways. It is a great fire; it cannot but shine brightly. And if this splendor is not present, they should walk with serious misgivings; they should believe that they indeed have many reasons for fear; they should strive to understand these; they should pray, walk with humility, and beseech the Lord not to lead them into temptation. For certainly if this sign isn't present, I fear we may walk into temptation. But if one proceeds with humility, strives to know the truth, is subject to a confessor, and communicates with him openly and truthfully, it will come about, as has been said, that the things by which the devil intends to cause death will cause life, however many the haunting illusions he wants to scare you with.
5. But if you feel this love of God I've mentioned and the fear I shall now speak of, rejoice and be at peace. In order to disturb your soul so that you will not enjoy these wonderful blessings the devil will",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,12,2,10,38,5,1,0,18,11,13,20,10,3,2,2,0,2,15,0
"171",1566,158,"set a thousand false fears before you and strive that others do so. Since he cannot win us over, he can at least try to make us lose something. He may strive to make souls lose when they might have gained a great deal by thinking that his favors are from God and are bestowed on creatures as wretched as themselves and that it is possible for God to grant favors -- for it seems sometimes we have forgotten about the Lord's ancient mercies.
6. Do you think it matters little to the devil to set up these fears? No, it matters a great deal, for he causes two kinds of harm. First, those who listen to him are struck with a terror of approaching prayer, for they think they will be deceived. Second, if it were not for these fears many more would come closer to God in seeing that He is so good, as I have said,  and that it is possible for Him now to communicate so much with sinners. They covet these favors. And they are right, for I know some persons who were encouraged by such favors and began prayer; and in a short while the favors became authentic, and the Lord granted them great ones.
7. So, Sisters, when you see among yourselves someone to whom the Lord gives favors, praise the Lord very much but don't think she is for this reason safe; rather help her with more prayer. No one can be safe while living and engulfed in the dangers of this tempestuous sea.
You will not fail to recognize this love where it is present, nor do I know how it can be concealed. If we love creatures here on earth, it's impossible, we are told, to hide this, and the more we do to hide it the more it is revealed (and it is something so lowly that it doesn't merit the name ""love,"" for it is grounded on nothing). And could one conceal a love that is so strong and just that it always increases and sees no reason to stop since its foundation is made from the cement of being repaid by another love? This other love can no longer be doubted since it was shown so openly and with so many sufferings and trials, and with the shedding of blood even to the point of death in order that we might have no doubt about it. Oh, God help me, how different must the love of God",3,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,16,1,13,24,6,1,4,12,12,7,15,2,3,2,0,1,1,7,0
"172",1566,159,"be from the love of creatures for whoever has experienced the former!
8. May it please His Majesty to give us His love before He takes us out of this life, for it will be a great thing at the hour of death to see that we are going to be judged by the One whom we have loved above all things. We shall be able to proceed securely with the judgment concerning our debts. It will not be like going to a foreign country but like going to our own, because it is the country of one whom we love so much and who loves us. [In this love -- besides everything else -- there is greater security than with earthly loves; in loving God we are certain that He loves us.] Remember here, my daughters, the gain there is in this love, and the loss in not having it. Such a loss puts us in the hands of the enemy, in hands so cruel, hands so hostile toward everything good, and so fond of everything bad.
9. What will become of the poor soul that, after being freed from the sufferings and trials of death, falls immediately into these hands? What a terrible rest it receives! How mangled as it goes to hell! What a multitude of different kinds of serpents! What a terrifying place! What a wretched inn! If it is hard for a self-indulgent person (for such are the ones who will be more likely to go there) to spend one night in a bad inn, what do you think that sad soul will feel at being in this kind of inn forever, without end?
Let us not desire delights, daughters; we are well-off here; the bad inn lasts for only a night. Let us praise God; let us force ourselves to do penance in this life. How sweet will be the death of one who has done penance for all his sins, of one who won't have to go to purgatory! Even from here below you can begin to enjoy glory! You will find no fear within yourself but complete peace.
10. As long as we have not reached this state, Sisters, let us beseech God that if therefore we are to receive sufferings, they will be received here below. For, with the hope of being freed from them, we can bear them here willingly, and we will not lose His friendship and grace. Let us beseech Him to give us His grace in this life so",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,11,3,15,31,2,4,4,5,5,5,5,8,1,0,6,4,3,9,0
"173",1566,160,"that we will not walk unawares into temptation.

CHAPTER 41
 
Speaks of the fear of God and of how we must be on guard against venial sins.
 
1. How lengthy I have been! But not as lengthy as I wanted to be, for it is a delight to speak about the love of God. What will it be like to possess it? May the Lord give it to me because of who His Majesty is. [Let me not leave this life, O my Lord, until I no longer desire anything in it; neither let me know any love outside of You, Lord, nor let me succeed in using this term ""love"" for anyone else. Everything is false since the foundation is false, and so the edifice doesn't last. I don't know why we are surprised. I laugh to myself when I hear it said: ""That person repaid me badly."" ""This other one doesn't love me."" What does anyone have to repay you for, or why should anyone love you? This experience will show you what the world is, for your very love for it will afterward punish you. And this is what wears you down: you realize you have let your affection become involved like children in their games.]
Now let us deal with the fear of God. This trait is also something easily recognized by the person who has it as well as by those who approach him. But I want you to understand that in the beginning it is not so developed, unless in some persons to whom as I have said, the Lord grants great favors, for in a short time He makes them rich in virtue. Hence this fear isn't discernible in everyone -- at the outset, I mean. It goes on increasing in strength each day. But it is soon recognized because in the beginning one starts to turn away from sin and its occasions and from bad companions; and other signs as well are seen. But once the soul has reached contemplation -- which is what we are now dealing with most -- fear of God also, as with love, becomes very manifest; it doesn't disguise itself even exteriorly. Despite the fact that you may watch these persons very carefully, you will not see them become careless. For no matter how long we observe them, the Lord keeps them in such a way that even if a thing very much to their own interest come along, they will not advertently commit a venial sin;",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,13,0,10,24,4,1,0,13,12,6,12,4,3,5,0,0,1,7,0
"174",1566,161,"mortal sins they fear like fire. And illusions involving sin are the ones I would want us, Sisters, to be very much afraid of. Let us beseech God always that the temptation may not be so strong as to make us offend Him, that its strength might not outweigh the fortitude He gives us to conquer it. This fear is what is important; it is what I desire may never be taken from us, for it is what will help us.
2. Oh, what a great thing it is to have resisted offending the Lord so that His slaves and servants in hell may be bound; for in the end all must serve Him despite themselves. But those in hell do so by force, whereas we do so willingly. Therefore, if we please the Lord, those in hell will be kept bound; they will not do anything that may be harmful to us however much they might draw us into temptation and set secret snares for us.
3. Be careful and attentive -- this is very important -- until you see that you are strongly determined not to offend the Lord, that you would lose a thousand lives rather than commit a mortal sin, and that you are most careful not to commit venial sins -- that is, advertently; for otherwise, who can go without committing many? But there is an advertence that is very deliberate; another that comes so quickly that committing the venial sin and adverting to it happen almost together in such a way that we don't first realize what we are doing. But from any very deliberate sin, however small it be, may God deliver us. [I don't know how we could be so bold as to go against such a great Lord, even though it be in something very small.] What's more, there is nothing small if it goes against His immense Majesty and we see He is looking at us. It seems to me a sin is very deliberate when, for example, one says: ""Lord, although this grieves You, I will do it; I'm already aware that You see it, and I know You do not want it, and I understand this; but I want to follow my whim and appetite more than Your will."" It doesn't seem to me possible that something like this can be called little, however light the fault; but it's serious, very serious. [For the love of God, daughters, never become careless in this regard; now -- glory be",2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,3,23,16,3,6,2,11,4,11,18,9,4,1,1,0,0,1,1
"175",1566,162,"to the Lord -- you are not.]
4. Consider, Sisters, for the love of God, if you want to gain this fear of the Lord, that it is very helpful to understand the seriousness of an offense against God and to reflect on this frequently in your thoughts; for it is worth our life and much more to have this virtue rooted in our souls. And until you have it, you must always proceed carefully and turn from every occasion and companion who does not help you come closer to God. We should take great care in everything we do to bend our will, and take care that our speech be edifying; we must flee those places where conversations are not of God.
It's very necessary that this fear be deeply impressed within the soul. Such fear is easy to obtain if there is true love together with a great inner determination, as I have said, not to commit an offense against God for any created thing, even though afterward the soul may sometimes fall because we are weak and have no reason to trust ourselves. When we are more determined we are less confident of ourselves, for our confidence must be placed in God. When we understand this that I said about ourselves, there will be no need to go about so tense and constrained; the Lord will protect us, and the habit acquired will now be a help against offending Him. The need instead will be to go about with a holy freedom, conversing with those who are good even though they may be somewhat worldly. For those who, before you possessed this authentic fear of God, were a poison and a means of killing the soul will afterward often be a help to your loving and praising God more because He has freed you from that which you recognize as a glaring danger. If previously you played a part in contributing to their weaknesses, now by your mere presence you contribute to their restraint; this happens without their having any idea of paying you honor.
5. I often praised the Lord, thinking it comes about that often a servant of God, without uttering a word, prevents things from being said against God. This must happen for the same reason that something similar happens here below: there is always some restraint so as not to offend an absent person in the presence of someone known to be his friend. So it is with a servant of God: his friendship",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,22,1,15,28,5,7,0,14,6,11,15,13,0,4,0,0,4,2,0
"176",1566,163,"with God wins him respect no matter how lowly his status, and others avoid afflicting him in a matter they so well realize would grieve him; that is, they avoid offending God in his presence. The fact is that I don't know the reason for this, but I do know that it's a common occurrence. So do not be tense, for if you begin to feel constrained, such a feeling will be very harmful to everything good, and at times you will end up being scrupulous and become incapable of doing anything for yourself or for others. And if you don't end up being scrupulous, this constraint will be good for you but it will not bring many souls to God, because they will see so much repression and tenseness. Our nature is such that this constraint is frightening and oppressive to others, and they flee from following the road that you are taking, even though they know clearly that it is the more virtuous path.
6. Another harm derives from this attitude; it is that of judging others. There are those who advance with greater holiness and in order to be of benefit to their neighbor speak with him freely and without this constraint; but since they do not journey by your path they at once seem to you to be imperfect. If they have a holy joy, it will seem to be dissipation, especially to those of us who have no learning or knowledge of what one can speak about without sinning. This constraint is a very dangerous thing; it means going about in continual temptation and it bears ill effects; it is detrimental to your neighbor. To think that if all do not proceed as you do, in this constrained way, they are not proceeding well is extremely wrong.
And there is another harm: in some things of which you must speak, and it is right that you speak, you don't dare do so for fear of going to extremes; rather, perhaps, you speak well of something that it would be very good for you to abhor.
7. So, Sisters, strive as much as you can, without offense to God, to be affable and understanding in such a way that everyone you talk to will love your conversation and desire your manner of living and acting, and not be frightened and intimidated by virtue. This is very important for religious; the holier they are the more sociable they are with their Sisters. And even though you may feel",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,9,1,18,16,8,4,2,17,5,9,13,6,1,5,3,0,2,1,0
"177",1566,164,"very distressed if all your Sisters' conversations do not go as you would like them to, never turn away from them if you want to help your Sisters and be loved. This is what we must strive for earnestly, to be affable, agreeable, and pleasing to persons with whom we deal, especially our Sisters.
8. Thus, my daughters, strive to think rightly about God, for He doesn't look at trifles as much as you think, and don't lose your courage or allow your soul to be constrained, for many blessings could be lost. Have the right intention, a resolute will, as I have said, not to offend God. Don't let your soul withdraw into a corner, for instead of obtaining sanctity you will obtain many imperfections that the devil in other ways will place before you; and, as I have said, you will not be of as much benefit to yourself or to others as you could have been.
9. Here you see how, with two virtues -- love and fear of God -- you can advance on this road calmly and quietly, but not carelessly since fear must always take the lead. As long as we live, we will never have complete security; that would be a great danger. And this is what our Teacher understood when at the end of this prayer He spoke these words to His Father as one who well understood they were necessary.

CHAPTER 42
 
Discusses these last words of the Our Father: Sed libera nos a malo. Amen. But deliver us from evil. Amen.
 
1. It seems to me Jesus was right to include Himself in this petition, for we already see how tired He was of this life when He said to His Apostles at the last supper; I have greatly desired to eat this supper with you. Here we see how weary He must have been of living. Nowadays people don't tire of living even if they go on to be a hundred, but always want to live longer. True, we don't suffer in life as much evil and as many trials as His Majesty suffered, nor such poverty. What was His whole life if not a continual death, in which He always saw beforehand that most cruel death they were going to inflict on Him? And this was the least of His sufferings; but how many offenses committed against His Father and what a multitude of souls that were lost! If one who possesses charity here on earth finds all this",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,12,2,16,15,3,6,5,7,9,15,9,14,5,5,0,0,8,2,3
"178",1566,165,"a great torment, what must have been the Lord's torment, with His boundless and immeasurable charity? And what a good reason He had to beseech the Father to free Him finally from so many evils and trials and bring Him to rest forever in the Father's kingdom, since He was its true inheritor!
2. Amen. By the ""amen"" I understand that since with this word all things come to an end, the Lord asks likewise that we be freed from all evil forever. [It is useless, Sisters, to think that while we live we can be free of many temptations and imperfections and even sins, for it is said that whoever thinks he is without sin deceives himself -- and this is true. Now, if we turn to bodily ailments and hardships, who is without very many and in many ways? Nor is it good that we ask to be without them.
Well, then, let us understand what we are asking for here since it seems impossible to say ""from all evil,"" whether of the body or, as I have said, of imperfections and faults in the service of God. I am not speaking about the saints -- they can do everything in Christ, as St. Paul said -- but sinners like myself. I see myself closed in by weakness, lukewarmness, and a lack of mortification, and many other things. I see that it behooves me to ask the Lord for a remedy. You, daughters, ask according to what you think. I do not find this remedy while living, and so I ask the Lord to deliver me from all evil forever. What good do we find in this life, Sisters, since we lack so much good and are absent from Him?
Deliver me, Lord, from this shadow of death, deliver me from so many trials, deliver me from so many sufferings, deliver me from so many changes, from so many compliments that we are forced to receive while still living, from so many, many, many things that tire and weary me, that would tire anyone who can bear to live. This weariness must come to me because I have lived so badly, and from seeing that the way I live now is still not the way I should live since I owe so much.] Thus I beseech the Lord to deliver me from all evil forever since I do not make up for what I owe; it could be that perhaps each day I become more indebted. And what is",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,6,14,1,10,14,0,5,1,10,12,9,5,14,3,5,0,2,7,0,0
"179",1566,166,"unendurable, Lord, is not to know for certain that I love You or that my desires are acceptable before You. O my Lord and my God, deliver me now from all evil and be pleased to bring me to the palace where all blessings are. What do they still hope for here, those to whom You have given knowledge of what the world is, and those who have a living faith concerning what the Eternal Father has kept for them?
3. To ask for these blessings with great desire and complete determination is a clear sign for contemplatives that the favors they receive in prayer are from God. Thus those who have this sign should esteem their prayer highly. In the case of my asking for these things the same is not true; I mean that it shouldn't be interpreted as a sign of divine favors; but since I have lived so badly, I fear living still longer; and so many trials weary me. It is no surprise that those who have a share in the consolations of God desire to be there where they will enjoy them more than in mere sips, that they do not want to remain in a life where there are these many obstacles to the enjoyment of so much good, and that they desire to be where the Sun of justice does not set. Everything they afterward see here below will be completely dark to them, and I marvel at how they live. They could not live with any contentment if they have received and already begun to enjoy the Lord's kingdom here below. And such a person must not live for his own will but for the will of his King.
4. Oh, how different this life would have to be in order for one not to desire death! How our will deviates in its inclination from that which is the will of God. He wants us to love truth; we love the lie. He wants us to desire the eternal; we, here below, lean toward what comes to an end. He wants us to desire sublime and great things; we, here below, desire base and earthly things. He would want us to desire only what is secure; we, here below, love the dubious. Everything is a mockery, my daughters, except beseeching God to free us from these dangers forever and draw us at last away from every evil. Even though our desire may not be perfect, let us force ourselves to make",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,14,1,5,29,1,4,0,7,7,23,6,14,1,0,0,0,5,4,0
"180",1566,167,"the request. What does it cost us to ask for a great deal? We are asking it of One who is powerful. But in order to be right, let us leave the giving to His will since we have already given Him our own. His name be forever hallowed in heaven and on earth, and may His will be always done in me. Amen.
[Here you see, friends, what it means to pray vocally with perfection. It means that you be aware of and understand whom you are asking, who it is that is asking, and what you are asking for. When they tell you that it isn't good to practice any other kind of prayer than vocal prayer, do not be distressed. Read this very carefully, and what you do not understand about prayer, beseech the Lord to teach you. For no one can take vocal prayer from you or make you recite the Our Father hastily and without understanding it. If some person should take it from you or counsel you to give it up, do not believe him. Believe that he is a false prophet and consider that in these times of ours you don't have to believe everybody. Even though there is nothing to fear from those who can counsel you now, we don't know what will come in the future.
I have also thought of saying something to you about how to recite the Hail Mary. But I have been so lengthy that I have to let it go. It is enough for you to have understood how to recite the Our Father well in order to know how to recite all the vocal prayers you must recite.]
5. Now see, Sisters, how the Lord by giving me understanding of the great deal we ask for when reciting this evangelical prayer has removed the difficulty involved in my teaching you and myself the path that I began to explain to you. May He be blessed forever! Certainly, it never entered my mind that this prayer contained so many deep secrets; for now you have seen the entire spiritual way contained in it, from the beginning stages until God engulfs the soul and gives it to drink abundantly from the fount of living water, which He said was to be found at the end of the way. [And having come out of it -- I mean of this prayer -- I don't know how to go any further.]
It seems the Lord has desired to give us understanding,",2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,2,0,1,20,0,3,12,2,0,0,22,7,4,10,10,3,2,0,0,1,0,2
"181",1566,168,"Sisters, of the great consolation contained in this prayer. It is highly beneficial to persons who don't know how to read. If they understand this prayer, they can draw a lot of doctrine from it and find consolation there. [And when books are taken away from us, this book cannot be taken away, for it comes from the mouth of Truth itself, who cannot err. And since, as I have said, we recite the Our Father so many times in a day, let us delight in it and strive to learn from so excellent a Master the humility with which He prays and all the other things that were mentioned.]
6. Sisters, beg this good Master to pardon me, for I have been bold to speak of such sublime things. His Majesty knows well that my intellect would not have been capable of it if He had not taught me what I have said. Be grateful to Him, Sisters, for He must have done so because of the humility with which you asked and desired to be taught by someone so miserable.
[Well, Sisters, it now seems the Lord doesn't want me to say any more, for I don't know what to say; although I thought of going on. The Lord has taught you and me the path that I have described in the book I said I wrote, how one reaches this fount of living water, what the soul feels there, how God satisfies it, takes away thirst for earthly things, and makes it grow in the things pertaining to the service of God. Those who have reached this fount will find that book very beneficial and receive much light from it. You may get it from Father Domingo Báñez, a presentado of the Order of St. Dominic, who as I said is my confessor and the one to whom I'll give this book. If this one is all right for you to see and he gives it to you, he'll also give you that other one.]
7. If he thinks this book will be helpful and gives it to you, I will be consoled that you are consoled. If it should be such that no one may see it, you can accept my good will, for by this work I have obeyed your command. I consider myself well paid for the trouble involved in writing it, for there has been no trouble at all in thinking out what I have said.
May the Lord be blessed and praised; from Him",7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,14,7,0,1,12,0,3,19,1,0,1,15,7,10,12,5,2,8,1,2,1,0,2
"182",1566,169,"comes every good we speak of, think about, and do. Amen. Let us praise God and always beseech Him to keep us in His hands, and all sinners as well, and not lead us into these hidden temptations. Here you see how with these two virtues -- love and fear of God -- you can advance on this road with calm and not think that at every step you see a ditch you could fall into; that way you would never arrive. But since we cannot even know with certitude that we in truth have these two virtues that are necessary, the Lord, taking pity on us because we live in so uncertain a life and among so many temptations and dangers, teaching us to ask -- and asking for us -- says with good reason: But deliver us from evil. Amen. Prologue
 
I have seen the mercies our Lord grants souls He has brought to these monasteries which observe the primitive rule of our Lady of Mount Carmel and which have been founded through His Majesty's good pleasure. For so many are the favors our Lord grants to some of the Sisters in particular that only souls who know about the need there is for an explanation of some of the things that pass between the soul and our Lord will be able to see the trial that is suffered in not having light. For a number of years now the Lord has given me great delight each time I hear or read some words from Solomon's Song of Songs. The delight is so great that without understanding the vernacular meaning of the Latin my soul is stirred and recollected more than by devotional books written in the language I understand. And this happens almost all the time, and even when the Latin words were translated for me into the vernacular I did not understand the text any more ...
2. For about two years, more or less, it seems to me the Lord had been giving me, for the sake of my purpose in writing this work, some understanding of the meaning of certain words, and I think these words will bring consolation to the Sisters our Lord leads by this path and also to me. For at times the Lord gives understanding of so much that I find myself hoping I won't forget, but I didn't dare put anything in writing.
3. Now in accord with the opinion of persons whom I'm obliged to obey, I shall",2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4,0,0,19,0,7,20,2,2,2,17,9,4,13,9,4,5,1,1,2,1,0
"183",1566,170,"write something about the understanding the Lord gives me of what is contained in the words that bring delight to my soul about this path of prayer. As I have said, it is along this path that the Lord leads these Sisters, and my daughters, in these monasteries. If this writing is such that you may see it, accept this poor little gift from one who desires for you as well as for herself all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, in whose name I begin. If I succeed in saying something worthwhile, the success will not be from me. May it please the divine Majesty... CHAPTER 1
 
Treats of the veneration with which the Sacred Scriptures should be read and of the difficulty women have in comprehending them, especially the Song of Songs.
 
Let the Lord kiss me with the kiss of His mouth, for Your breasts are better than wine, etc. ... (Sg. 1:2).
 
I have carefully noted that it seems from what is manifested here that the soul is speaking with one person and asking peace from another. It says: Let Him kiss me with the kiss of His mouth; and next, seemingly, it speaks to someone whom it is with: Your breasts are better.
I don't understand why this is; and that I don't understand gives me great delight. Indeed, daughters, the soul will not have to reflect upon the things it seems we can grasp with our lowly intellects here below as intensely as it will upon those that can in no way be understood; nor will the former make it respect God as much as do His mysteries. Thus I highly recommend that when you read some book or hear a sermon or think about the mysteries of our sacred faith you avoid tiring yourselves or wasting your thoughts in subtle reasoning about what you cannot properly understand. Many things are not meant for women to understand, nor even for men.
2. When the Lord desires to give understanding, His Majesty does so without our effect. I am saying this to women, and also to men who aren't obliged to defend the truth through their learning. For those whom the Lord has called to explain the Scriptures to us must understandably work, and they will gain much from their work. But we should accept with simplicity whatever the Lord gives us; and what He doesn't we shouldn't tire ourselves over, but rejoice in considering what a great Lord and God we have. For one",2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,9,6,0,1,22,0,3,24,1,0,1,24,6,8,16,4,1,9,0,4,2,6,1
"184",1566,171,"word of His will contain within itself a thousand mysteries, and thus our understanding is only very elementary. That we do not understand His words when they are written in Latin or Hebrew or Greek is no surprise. But even in our own language; how many things there are in the psalms of the glorious King David that after being translated into the vernacular for us remain as obscure as they were in Latin! Thus always guard against wasting your thoughts on these things or tiring yourselves, for women have need of no more than what is sufficient for their meditations. With this, God will favor them. When His Majesty desires to give us understanding of the words, without worry or work on our part, we shall surely find it. As for the rest, let us humble ourselves and, as I have said, rejoice that we have such a Lord, that even words of His spoken in our own language cannot be understood.
3. It will seem to you that there are some words in the Song of Songs that could have been said in another style. In light of our dullness such an opinion doesn't surprise me. I have heard some persons say that they avoid listening to them. Oh, God help me, how great is our misery! Just as poisonous creatures turn everything they eat into poison, so do we. From favors as great as those the Lord gives us here in revealing what is possessed by the soul who loves Him and in encouraging it to speak with His Majesty and find delight in Him, we have to create fears and give opinions that manifest the small degree of love of God we have.
4. O my Lord, how poorly we profit from the blessing You grant us! You seek ways and means and you devise plans to show Your love for us; we, inexperienced in loving You, esteem this love so poorly that our minds, little exercised in love, go where they always go and cease to think of the great mysteries this language, spoken by the Holy Spirit, contains within itself. What more was necessary than this language in order to enkindle us in His love and make us realize that not without good reason did He choose this style.
5. Indeed, I recall hearing a priest who was a religious preach a very admirable sermon, most of which was an explanation of those loving delights with which the bride communed with God. And there was",2,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,3,16,0,7,25,4,2,2,16,8,3,12,6,0,11,0,0,4,6,1
"185",1566,172,"so much laughter, and what he said was so poorly taken, that I was shocked. He was speaking about love since the sermon was on Maundy Thursday, when one shouldn't be speaking of anything else. And I see clearly that the reason for not understanding is the one I mentioned (that we practice so poorly the love of God), for it doesn't seem to us possible for a soul to commune in such a way with God. These people did not benefit, surely because they did not understand, nor, I believe, did they think anything but that the preacher made the sermon up in his own head. Yet, I know other persons who have drawn out great good, delight, and security against fears, so much so that they had to offer special praise to our Lord. He has left a salutary remedy to souls that love Him with a fervent love because they understand and see that it is possible for God to humble Himself so much. For experience was not enough to keep them from fearing when the Lord granted them great favors. What they see represented here makes them feel secure.
6. I know someone who for a number of years had many fears, and nothing gave her assurance, but the Lord was pleased that she hear some words from the Song of Songs, and through them she understood that her soul was being well guided. As I have said, she understood that it was possible for a soul in love with its Spouse to experience all these favors, swoons, deaths, afflictions, delights, and joys in relation to Him. It does so after it has left all the world's joys out of love for Him and is completely given over and abandoned into His hands, and when it has done this not just in words, as happens with some, but in all truth, confirmed with works.
Oh, my daughters, how well God repays! You have a Lord and Spouse with whom nothing takes place without His seeing and understanding it! Thus, even though the things be very small, do not fail to do what you can for love of Him. His Majesty will repay for them; He looks only at the love with which you do them.
7. Hence, I conclude this matter by saying that you should never dwell on what you do not understand in Sacred Scripture or the mysteries of our faith more than I have said, nor should you be startled by the lofty words",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,2,17,1,9,30,5,0,2,16,10,3,11,9,5,9,2,2,1,8,0
"186",1566,173,"that take place between God and the soul. Being what we are, the love that He had and has for us surprises and bewilders me more; for knowing that He has such love, I already understand that there is no exaggeration in the words by which He reveals it to us, for He has shown this love even more through his deeds. But when you reach this place in my writing, I ask you that for love of me you pause a little to think upon what He has shown us and what He has suffered for us, observing clearly that a love so powerful and strong that it made Him suffer so much could not reveal itself in words that should be any surprise to us.
8. Well now, to return to what I began saying, these words must contain great things and mysteries since they are of such value that when I asked learned men to explain what the Holy Spirit meant by them and what the true meaning was they answered that the doctors wrote many commentaries and yet never finished explaining the words fully. Since this is so, it will seem to be excessive pride on my part to want to explain something about them for you. It is not my intention, however little my humility, to think that I can get to the truth of them. What I do intend is that, just as I delight in what the Lord gives me understanding of when I hear some passage from the Song of Songs, you will perhaps find consolation in it, as I do, if I tell you. And I interpret the passage in my own way, even though my understanding of it may not be in accord with what is meant. For if we do not depart from what the Church and the saints hold (which is why learned men who understand the matter will examine this carefully before you see it), the Lord gives us license -- from what I think -- just as He does when we think of the Passion and consider many more things about the anguish and torments the Lord must have suffered than the Evangelists record. And if we do not indulge in curiosity, as I said at the beginning, but accept the understanding His Majesty gives us, I hold it as certain that we do not offend Him when we find delight and consolation in His words and works. A king would be happy and pleased",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,1,10,0,5,22,1,1,3,29,6,9,10,7,1,5,0,0,1,6,0
"187",1566,174,"if he saw a little shepherd he loved looking spellbound at the royal brocade and wondering what it is and how it was made. Nor must we make women stand so far away from enjoyment of the Lord's riches. If they argue and teach and think they are right without showing their writings to learned men; yes, that would be wrong. Consequently, I am not thinking I am right in what I say -- the Lord knows this well. But as with this little shepherd I mentioned, it consoles me to tell my meditations to my daughters; and what I tell will contain plenty of foolishness. Thus I begin with the favor of my divine King and with the permission of my confessor. May it please His Majesty that as He has wanted me to succeed in explaining other things for you -- and perhaps He did so because they were for you -- I might succeed in explaining these. If I don't I will consider the time well spent that I occupy in writing and reflecting upon material so divine that I haven't deserved to hear it.
9. It seems to me from what she says in the beginning that she is speaking with a third person; and she herself makes it known that there are in Christ two natures, one divine and the other human. I'm not going to dwell on this, because my intention is to speak about what I think can be beneficial to us who engage in prayer; although everything is beneficial for the encouragement and admiration of a soul that ardently loves the Lord. His Majesty knows well that even though at times -- and these were few -- I have heard explanations of some of these words and have been told their meaning when I asked, I don't remember the explanations at all, for I have a very poor memory. Thus, I shall be able to say only what the Lord teaches me and what serves my purpose; and I don't remember ever having heard anything about this first verse.
Let Him kiss me with the kiss of His mouth.
10. O my Lord and my God, and what words are these that a worm speaks them to its Creator! May You be blessed, Lord, for in so many ways have You taught us! But who will dare, my King, utter these words without Your permission? The thought is frightening, and so it will be frightening that I tell anyone to utter them. People",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,3,16,0,6,22,3,1,0,21,11,6,12,4,2,9,0,1,0,4,0
"188",1566,175,"will say I am a fool, that the words don't mean this, that they have many meanings, that obviously we must not speak such words to God, that for this reason it is good that simple people do not read these things. I confess that the passage has many meanings. But the soul that is enkindled with a love that makes it mad desires nothing else than to say these words. Indeed, the Lord does not forbid her to say them.
God help me! Why are we surprised? Isn't the deed more admirable? Do we not approach the most Blessed Sacrament? And I was even wondering if the bride was asking for this favor that Christ afterward gave us. I also wondered whether she was asking for that union so great that God became man, for that friendship that he effected with the human race. Obviously a kiss is the sign of great peace and friendship among two persons. May the Lord help us understand how many kinds of peace there are.
11. Before I go any further, and so as not to forget, I want to say one thing -- very important in my opinion -- although the matter would fit better at another time. I hold as certain that there are many persons who approach the most Blessed Sacrament (and please the Lord I be lying) with serious mortal sins. Yet, if such persons were to hear a soul dying with love of its God say these words, they would be surprised and consider it great boldness. At least I am sure they themselves would not say them, for these words and others similar ones in the Song of Songs are said by love. Since such persons have no love, they can easily read the Song of Songs every day and not themselves become involved with the words; nor would they even dare take the words on their lips. For truly even hearing them makes one fear, for these words bear in themselves great majesty. How much majesty You bear, my Lord, in the most Blessed Sacrament. But since these persons do not have a living faith but a dead one, You do not speak to them when they see You so humble under the species of bread. They do not deserve to hear -- and thus they are not so daring.
12. As a result these words in themselves, taking them only literally, would truly cause fear if the one uttering them were in his senses. But the",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,17,3,8,32,2,2,0,13,12,11,11,9,1,16,0,1,1,5,1

But I know that the desire I have of seeing you very holy ... The prioress doesn't write anything now about my Señora Doña Mariana, and so I think she must have left.

Your honor's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. ... that your paternity is in that place. Today the prior of Carmona passed by with another presentado. (Padre Fray Gregorio will tell you about some of the things we had to undergo.) He told me that only Cota had retired to the Carmelite monastery and that the prosecutor of the royal council had taken over his case and that the council was dealing with it. This seems to me a bland way to be dealing with the preposterous things they did, although this padre well knows that they were in the wrong. He says he has stated this repeatedly and that he is going to the nuncio to tell him to punish those who were guilty and not make everyone pay. And he is going to petition that you not be the visitator because none of them will obey you and that the nuncio choose someone else.
2. I was thinking whether it might be good if you on your own made this request of both the nuncio and the king, pointing out how those friars have this stubborn notion and feel so much hostility toward you that your visitation could hardly bear fruit ... and would be to the satisfaction of everyone. And if they do not grant this request, it would be for me at least a comfort to know that you did what you could to free yourself of the obligation. The thought that they will have to obey you again and then once more start agitating against you is for me worse than death. Think about it, mi padre; when there is nothing else you can do, then proceed under obedience and the Lord will take over.

4. I am going to Toledo and I am thinking of staying there until Doña Luisa provides what is necessary for this house. Now she is saying that she will send a workman here, but shows no enthusiasm about it.
I am well ... To our Padre Fray Jerónimo Gracián, apostolic commissary of the Carmelite Order.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit guide and enlighten your honor, and may your Blessed Virgin accompany you.
I tell you, I believe you should make use of the least culpable among those friars to execute your orders. If that provincial had not carried on so foolishly, he would not have been a bad executioner. I am much more encouraged now than I was that other time.
2. You should know that my good friend Salazar is here. Hardly had I written that I needed to see him than he circled back many leagues so as to come here. He is indeed a friend. I was delighted with his visit. He says that the chief angel is very happy to have a niece among the butterflies and that he esteems them highly, and Salazar told him about the eagles and never stops praising them.
3. The prioress and sisters here send you many greetings. They are praying urgently for your paternity. My Isabel is doing very nicely. The enclosed letter is from Señora Doña Juana. She will be my consolation, although it's a terrible embarrassment for me that this house cannot be set up to provide for her adequately. How come you didn't inform that man Roque about my letters? Now I see that that is the name I wanted to know. Pardon the length of this; it was a way of relaxing. And God be with you.

And tell me also how things in Andalusia are going and of Padre Fray Buenaventura, about whom I am worried.

... of October, and I am your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Time will bring you to lose a little of your simplicity, which I certainly understand to be that of a saint. But since the devil does not want everyone to be a saint, those who are wretched and malicious like myself would want to remove the occasions of sin. I can express and have much love for you for many reasons, but this cannot be so for all the nuns, nor will all superiors be like mi padre with whom one can speak so familiarly. God has entrusted this treasure to you, but you mustn't think that all the others will care for it the way you do. I tell you truly I fear much more the fact that men can rob you than that demons can. And what the nuns see me say and do (because I know whom I'm addressing and my age allows it), they think they can do also, and they will be right. But this does not mean that you should stop loving them, rather that you should love them still more.

And the truth of it is that, despite my wretchedness, from the time I began to have daughters like these I have gone about with so much circumspection and vigilance, keeping a watch on how the devil might tempt them through me that, glory to God, I don't think there are any particularly serious things they have been",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,13,1,10,20,4,1,1,13,11,12,7,13,2,3,0,0,1,3,0
"193",1568,4,"able to note (for His Majesty has helped me). I confess that I have striven to hide my imperfections from them -- although there are so many they must have seen a good number -- as well as my love and concern for Paul. I often point out to them how necessary he is for the order and that I am under an obligation -- as if I could act otherwise if I didn't have this reason.
3. But how tiresome I am! May it not prove a burden to mi padre to have to hear these things, for you and I are weighed down with a very heavy load and we have to render an account to God and to the world. And since you understand the love with which I say this, you can pardon me and do me the favor I've asked of you: not to read in public the letters I write to you. Remember that people interpret things differently and that superiors should never be so open about some matters. It may come to pass that I am writing about a third party or about myself and that it would not be well for such matters to be known. There is a great difference for me between speaking of certain things with you and speaking of them with others, even my own sister. Just as I would not want anyone to hear me when I speak with God, or hinder me from being alone with him, so it is with Paul ... For Madre María de San José, prioress in Seville.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with you, my daughter. I received your letter written on 3 November. I tell you that your letters never tire me but give me rest from other tiring things. I was amused that you spelled out the date. Please God you didn't do so to avoid humbling yourself by putting it down in numbers.
2. Before I forget, the letter to Padre Mariano is very good, if it were not for that Latin. God deliver all my daughters from presuming to be Latinists. May you never try doing so again or permit other nuns to try. I desire much more that you dare to appear simple, which is very characteristic of saints, rather than so eloquent. This is what you get for sending me your letters open. But now since you have gone to confession to our padre, you will be more mortified. Tell him that I almost",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,1,11,0,5,13,1,0,1,9,6,11,15,8,1,6,1,0,5,2,1
"194",1568,5,"made a general confession the other day to the one I mentioned, and I didn't experience a twentieth of the sorrow I experienced when I had to confess to him. See what an ugly temptation this is!
3. Pray for my present confessor who has been a great consolation to me, for it is no small matter for me to be satisfied in this regard. Oh, how well you acted in not calling on the confessor who tormented me so much down there! I wasn't happy in that place with anything. If our padre was a source of happiness, you well know how many anxieties went along with it. And the happiness that you could have given me, if you had so wished, because I find your company delightful, you refused to offer. I am glad that you now understand my affection. As for the other one from Caravaca, may God forgive her, she is sorry now also. Such is the power that truth has.
4. Today she sent me a habit made of coarse wool and it's the most suited to our purposes that I've worn -- very light. I was deeply grateful to her, for my other one was too worn out to protect me from the cold. And they themselves made the material for the undertunics, although here there is no mention at all of undertunics during the whole summer, and they do much fasting. Now I am beginning to be a nun. Pray that this will last.
5. I sent word to my brother that you have the money. He'll send the muleteer from Avila to get it. You do well not to send it without a letter from him. Take care to remind our padre to take up the matter with the duke that he mentioned to me. With his having so much business to attend to and being so alone, I don't know where he finds the energy, if not -- through a miracle -- from God. I don't think it even entered my mind to say that he not eat there at the monastery, for I see that the need is great. I only say that outside meal times he not go there often, lest this be noticed and he be prevented from ever going there. Rather you are doing me a great favor by the diligence you use to provide for his comfort. I will never be able to repay you. Tell this to the sisters, for also my Gabriela was happy to",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,10,0,5,21,1,1,2,12,9,7,7,4,2,2,1,0,0,0,2
"195",1568,6,"tell me about this in her letter. Give my regards to her and to all the sisters and all my friends. Give my special greetings to Padre Antonio de Jesús. We are praying that he will benefit from the treatment he is undergoing. I have been sorry for him and so has the prioress. Also give my regards to Fray Gregorio and Fray Bartolomé.
6. The prioress of Malagón is even worse than she usually is. Yet I am somewhat consoled, for I'm told that the source of the pain is not in the lungs and that she does not have tuberculosis. And Ana de la Madre de Dios, the nun who is here, says that she was in that same condition and that she got well. God can do it. I don't know what to say about all the trials that God has given them there. Besides the illnesses they are destitute; they have neither wheat nor money but a world of debts. Please God the 400 ducats that Salamanca owes them, and were reserved for this house -- for I already spoke to our padre about it -- will be enough to take care of the situation. I have already sent a part of the amount. Their expenses have been high and of many kinds. For this reason I would not want the prioresses of houses having an income to be very prodigal, nor any of the others either, for they will end up by losing everything.
7. The whole burden lies on poor Beatriz, the only one who is well. And she has been entrusted by the prioress with charge of the house. For want of good men, as they say ... I am very happy that you are not in want of them there. Don't be foolish in not noting the cost of postage and everything else I tell you to note. You would be losing so much, and it's foolishness. I am sorry that his companion is Fray Andrés, for I don't believe he knows how to keep quiet, and I'm even more sorry that he eats at El Carmen. For love of God tell him to be careful, and he would be tempting God to go elsewhere than Los Remedios on leaving there. May God watch over you and all the nuns and make you saints, for I have many more letters to write.
Today is 19 November.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
8. Turn over. I have already mentioned that I received the letters among which were those",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,7,11,0,11,11,0,1,2,4,4,7,4,6,1,5,0,1,2,1,1
"196",1568,7,"from the Indies and Avila. I would like to know who gave them to you, so as to respond, and when the armada is leaving.
9. I am delighted that you bear poverty so well and that God so provides for your needs. May he be blessed forever. You did very well to give the tunics to our padre, for I have no need of them. What we all need most is that you not allow him to eat with those people, and that he be on his guard, for God is doing us such a favor by giving him health in the midst of so many trials. With regard to using linen and wool mixed together, I would prefer that you wear linen when necessary. Otherwise you would be opening the door to never observing the constitutions well. The material you would end up with would be almost as hot, and you would be observing neither one rule nor the other, and the custom will have begun.
10. I am troubled by what you say about how the rule stating that stockings be made of coarse cloth or rough tow is not observed. Tell our padre some time that where the rule speaks of stockings no indication should be given about the material other than that it be poor, and let me know what he says; or better, that nothing be said at all about the material, but that it simply mention stockings. And don't forget. Get him to delay his visitation of the province as much as you can, until it is seen where some things will end up. Have you noticed how charming his letter to Teresita is? There is no end to the talk about her and her virtue. Julián speaks wonders of her, which is no small matter. Read the letter that Isabel wrote to his paternity. 1. Jesus be with your reverence. I received the packet of letters which included the one from the prioress of Paterna. The many others you mention will perhaps come tomorrow, which is Thursday. They are safe being sent by this route -- they won't be lost. I was delighted with the ones that have arrived, and also the one from you. May God be blessed for everything.
2. Oh, padre, what joy comes to my heart when I see someone from this order -- where God has been so offended -- promoting something that is for his honor and glory, and preventing some sins! Yet I feel distressed and",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,2,8,0,5,17,1,1,1,6,5,11,13,6,2,5,3,2,1,0,1
"197",1568,8,"envious to see what little use I am in this matter. I would embrace trials and dangers if I could have a share in the spoils of those who are in the midst of them. Sometimes, since I am so wretched, I rejoice to have this calm for myself here. And when I receive news about the trials they are going through down there, I feel undone and I envy the nuns in Paterna. I am overjoyed that God is beginning to make use of the discalced nuns, for often, when I see souls so courageous in these houses, I think that it would not be possible for God to give them so much without a reason. Even if this amounts to no more than their having lived in that monastery -- for, after all, they avoided any offense against God there -- I am most happy. And how much more so in that I hope in His Majesty their presence there will be most beneficial.
3. Don't forget to include in the document for the friars the authority also to give permission for the foundation of houses for nuns. You ought to know that my confessor here is Doctor Velázquez, who is a canon of this church and a most learned servant of God -- you can easily check this out. He can't accept the idea that no more monasteries for nuns are to be founded, and he ordered me that through Señora Doña Luisa, by way of the ambassador, I try to obtain permission from the general, and if not from him from the pope. He says they should say that our monasteries are mirrors for Spain and that he will provide a draft of the letter. I am informing you about a foundation that is being offered to us. Please answer me on these two matters.
4. I have been greatly consoled by this note you sent me -- May God reward you -- although your words were about something already fixed deeply in my heart. How is it that you say nothing about Fray Baltasar? Give my regards to all.
5. I have to laugh that Padre Fray Juan de Jesús says I want you all to go barefoot, for I am the one who always opposed this to Padre Fray Antonio. He would have found out that he was mistaken had he asked me. My intention was to attract people of talent, for they would be frightened away by a lot of austerity. What was set",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,16,0,7,13,2,4,0,11,11,13,14,4,2,4,1,1,1,0,0
"198",1568,9,"down was only so as to distinguish ourselves from the other Carmelites. It could be that I said their feet would be just as cold as when bare.
6. I said something similar when we were talking about how bad it looked for friars to be going around barefoot on good mules; the two don't fit together. Mules shouldn't be permitted except for long journeys or in great need. Some young friars came here traveling by donkey when the distance was short and they could have walked. And so I repeat it doesn't look right for these young discalced friars to be traveling on mules and with saddles. That they go about barefoot never entered my mind; there are already too many doing so. Advise them not to do so but to follow the custom. Write about this to our padre.
7. What I have insisted on with him is that the friars be given good meals. I am well aware of what you say, and it often saddens me -- and even yesterday, or today, before I saw your letter I was sad. It seemed to me on observing the way they treat themselves that within no more than a couple of days everything could fall apart. I turned to God for comfort, for he who started this work will set everything right, and so I was delighted that you share this opinion.
8. The other thing I urged that he impose is manual work, even if it is no more than making baskets or something, and that this be done during the recreation hour if there is no other time. This is most important where there are no studies. Understand, padre, that I am fond of strictness in the practice of virtue but not of austerity, as you see in our houses of nuns. This is perhaps so because I am not very penitential. I praise our Lord greatly because he gives you so much light in matters of such importance. It is great to desire his honor and glory in everything. May it please His Majesty to give us the grace to die a thousand deaths for this, amen, amen. Today is Wednesday 12 December.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
9. You are being very charitable in sending me those letters, for our padre writes only very briefly when he writes me. I am not surprised by this, and I even beg him to do so. Well, I praise the Lord when I read them, and you should too",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,4,1,1,9,2,3,22,0,0,2,4,5,10,14,4,4,3,1,1,0,0,1
"199",1568,10,"because you were the initiator of that work. Don't fail to speak often with the archdeacon. We also have with us the dean and the other canons. I am already making new friends. It is all explained well in the book I mentioned I wrote, and thus there is no reason to deal with it here in any particular way. There, I said everything I knew. If God brings any among you to this state of contemplation -- for, as I said, some of you are in it -- you should strive to obtain that book after I die; it will mean a lot to you. Those of you who are not in this state will have no reason to do anything but struggle to carry out what is mentioned in this book I'm writing now, to make progress in as many ways as you can, and to use diligence; for the Lord will grant you the ability to do these things if you beg Him for it and adopt the proper measures. As for the rest, the Lord Himself will give it and not deny it to anyone who reaches the end of the journey by fighting as has been said. For my daughter, Madre María Bautista, prioress of the Conception monastery.
1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. Your annoyance made me smile. I assure you it is no pleasure for me to have to give up seeing you. In fact, it would be such a pleasure for me that it seems to me a lack of perfection to try to go there without any compelling reason. Moreover, if Padre Maestro is there, what need is there for me? So, if I am given orders to go there, I will go; if not, I'll have nothing to say. I really think I can be of service wherever I go, even when it seems there is no need. But since you are so prudent, perhaps I'd have nothing more to do than rest. I'm no longer good for much else.
2. With regard to the lay sister, there is nothing to say; the deed is done. But I tell you it is a hard thing to have to see so many lay sisters for every three nuns, as they say. It makes no sense. I believe we will have to get Father Visitator to set a limit as we have for the choir nuns. I don't know what excuse you have for not telling me how sick you are;",3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,0,7,1,4,8,1,2,1,13,13,10,16,6,2,8,1,0,1,0,0
"200",1568,11,"this grieves me. It's very foolish for you to be worried about perfection when you should be pampering yourself, for your health is important to us. I don't know what mi padre is doing; take note that I will be very annoyed if you do not obey María de la Cruz in this case.
3. I am very discreet in similar things. The truth of the matter is that I have never been very perfect, and now I think I have a greater motive, since I am old and tired; it would frighten you to see me. These days my stomach has been weak, so the nuts you sent arrived at a good time. Although there were still some left from others that had been sent to me, these are very good. You eat the ones that remain for love of me, and give my best regards to the Countess of Osorno. It seems to me that I received only one letter from her, and I wrote one; but I will write again as soon as I can. Today they brought me three packets of letters and yesterday a good number of them. Since my confessor is at the grille and says I should send this messenger boy off quickly, I won't be able to write at length.
4. Oh, how the letter from mi padre saddens me! You should find out at once whether the power the visitator has is in writing. How these canons weary me; and now they want authorization from the prelate so as to oblige us to pay rent on the land. If mi padre is able to give it, it must be in writing and notarized. He should consider how far his powers extend; and if he can give it, let him send it to me at once, for goodness' sake, if he doesn't want the canons to be annoyed with me. We would now be in the house if it were not for a miserable 3,000 maravedis, and perhaps there would be time left over for me to be sent to your monastery. I would like that, even if it were just to see what this nun of yours is like. Tell María de la Cruz that her letter made me happy and that the gift I now ask of her is that she surround your reverence with care.
5. Don't fail to communicate with the rector, for I assure you he may be a greater friend of yours than anyone else may be;",3,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,2,3,1,11,16,3,2,4,7,8,17,12,6,2,1,0,1,5,1,1
"201",1568,12,"indeed, these fathers are helpful. The rector here made the purchase, and he went to the chapter about it, and took care of everything very well. May God likewise take care of you, my daughter, and do not be angry with me, for I have told you why I am not coming to Valladolid. It would be a lie for me to say I don't want to. If I were to come, all the dealings with the nobility and all the commotion would greatly tire me; but I would put up with it all in order to see you.
6. Last night I wrote you a few lines, and now I've written a lot considering the hurry I am in to finish. All the nuns send their regards. May God make you holy. The replies that you make in the letter from mi padre are very amusing; I don't know whom to believe. Don't tire yourself trying to get him write to me; if you tell me how his health is, I will be very satisfied with that.
7. Tell me where he is from because if it is Medina, he will be doing wrong not to pass by this way. This messenger boy came today, July 16, at ten o'clock. I am sending him back at four. Why don't you tell me about the business affairs of Señora Doña María. Give her my best. May God keep you.
Your servant and still ...
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your lordship. Every day I comprehend better what a favor it is from our Lord to understand the good that lies in suffering. This enables me to bear calmly the lack of satisfaction present in the things of this life, for they are of such short duration.
2. You should know that I was hurrying so that I could have a good summer in Avila or Valladolid. Then, Padre Gracián came here, who is the provincial of Andalusia through a commission given him by the nuncio after the counter-brief. ... He has such good qualities that I would be delighted if he could kiss your hands so that I could find out whether I am fooling myself. He desires very much to do so since I told him about the favor you always show toward the order. It has been a great consolation for me to see so good a man among the order's members.
3. Well, we are leaving for Seville on Monday of next week.",2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,2,11,0,5,22,0,2,1,7,8,15,9,8,2,1,1,1,4,1,0
"202",1568,13,"The distance is 50 leagues. I truly believe that he would not have placed me under any obligation, but his desire for this was so great that if I hadn't complied, I would have been left with a disturbing scruple that I wasn't being obedient, something I always desire. As for me, I have felt weighed down and am not pleased with having to pass the summer in Seville with this scorching heat. Please the Lord, it will be for his service, for the rest is of little importance. I beg you to bless me and not forget to pray to our Lord for me.
4. They say they will have messengers there, for there are none in this isolated place; I will write you from there. May it please our Lord to keep you well, as I always beseech him. Padre Julián de Avila does the same. He is a real help to me. He kisses your hands many times. We keep you very much present and the house of St. Joseph and the quiet I had there. May the Lord be served by everything, and may he watch over you much more than over me. Today is the vigil of the feast of the Ascension.
Your lordship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
My health has been good here, much more than usual, glory to God. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, padre and señor mio. Padre Julián de Avila and also Señor Maestro wrote me about the house of Juan de Avila de la Vega which is for sale. It is just right for us, both the price (which Padre Julián de Avila says will be little more than 1,000 ducats) and the location, which for our purpose is excellent. That it is close to you is sufficient.
2. I really think that it will be so old that there will be immediate need for repairs. That matters little if there is ample space and a well. I beg you to begin at once to confer about buying it, but without looking too eager because then they will raise the price.
3. My brother is going to Madrid and you can notify him there to send you the authorization. May the Lord direct matters, for it would be a great thing to have our own house. Because I have many letters to write I cannot go on at length. May God preserve you for me for many years and give me the opportunity to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,4,14,0,2,18,1,0,1,3,5,8,11,5,2,3,2,1,1,1,1
"204",1569,1,"... is a little song for Fray John of the Cross they sent me from the Incarnation. Tell him that I told you I greatly enjoyed it. I would like Francisco to sing it for you. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, mi padre, amen. For goodness' sake, don't use señora in the title when addressing me, for that's not our way of speaking. What a great pity those stabbings in Andalusia are.
2. Our padre isn't writing anything to me except that he is well, although at times he does suffer some ailments. The waters from the spring at Antequera will cure him. I just don't understand this business of Padre Fray Buenaventura, because I think you wrote to me that they had taken away his authority. If they have taken it away, how, unless they have given it back to him, can he send to have friars arrested? God has granted us a great favor in that our padre has carried out matters with so much peace. And as long as no one stops him short, he will bring everything to a better conclusion, which is what I hope for in the Lord.
3. Padre, don't become distressed over the arrival of Tostado. Leave matters to our Lord, for this is his work and he will draw out much good from it all. It doesn't cause me any grief, because I see that all our affairs seem to be going upstream and they are going better than those that seem to be flowing with the current, because God is showing his power. What seems hardest is that he is coming just when the nuncio is departing, for the commission of our padre will then come to an end.
4. You should know that the nuncio sent for Tostado some days ago, and the friars here, those of the cloth, are surprised because of his delay in coming. I think they will send a messenger if they haven't done so already. They say their mistake lay in not having sent someone whose sole mission would have been to summon him.
5. All right, let him come, and we will see how this venture will end up. If the king remains as steadfast as he was, and the others, too, his coming will have little impact. And should they change their opinion, this will be for the best; don't worry, mi padre. My counsel is that you should remain in the house that they gave you",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,2,1,1,8,1,6,15,2,0,3,9,9,10,13,4,2,3,1,0,0,0,0
"205",1569,2,"there; give up looking for property. I can't bear those negotiations and setting aside the certain for the doubtful, for time is followed by more time.
6. Remain where you are for now. I believe it would have been better to have made a foundation for nuns than to negotiate for something for the friars better than what they would construct for themselves; have no doubt about it. I already saw the truth of this in Madrid during the eight days that I was there. Let's not get overwhelmed, for these are serious matters and, as you say, the best thing about them is the persecution. And since nothing is achieved without it, all is going well for now.
7. I am delighted that our padre is not in Seville and, as you say, it would be better if he came closer to us up here, although there is a house of discalced friars in Granada where he could stay. But still, if his commission ends and Padre Tostado keeps his power, it would be good if they did not meet. Those who are here say only that Tostado must go directly to Madrid; that is the command the nuncio gave. They say that it is true he was given the royal ordinance, but that the royal council has reconsidered the matter and changed their opinion.
8. Yesterday Pedro González told me that he saw in a letter from Rome that another nuncio has been named. I believe, padre, that he will come thoroughly forewarned against us; but if God is with us, etc.
9. Padre Maestro Fray Pedro Fernández is here. He has come to see me. I believe a month will go by before he goes to Madrid. Be sure, padre, he will not go against the acts of the apostolic visitators. As for Padre Tostado, serve and obey him; but not in something contrary to the acts, for that would destroy us. Therefore if he comes, however gentle you may be, you should remain firm on this point. This won't matter to our Father General as long as we are under obedience to him. If the acts are observed -- as they will be -- it would be life-giving to us if Tostado took over the reform. May it do him much good! I am afraid, mi padre, that God will not do us this favor! May it please His Majesty to guide things for His greater service, and may whatever comes come.
10. I am sending a request for",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,0,3,0,6,15,4,1,1,4,7,16,16,7,4,4,0,0,0,0,0
"206",1569,3,"Juan Díaz to do me the favor of attending to a business matter in Caravaca. You will see what it is because I am sending the report and the letters of recommendation for the Bishop of Cartagena. I don't think it would be a bad idea for you to beseech the duchess for me to send a servant to recommend the matter to him also. For it is said that he is very devoted to her ladyship. I don't know how to express in words the affliction those sisters are going through, and they are so far away. Seeing the occupations ... Don't fail to help them for the love of God.
May His Majesty be with you always, amen.
Today is 6 February. My regards to Father Prior.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence. Oh, how I would like to make this a long letter! For your letter brought me great joy. But I was bled yesterday and they've ordered me to be bled again today. This has hindered me from writing. I didn't think the mail carrier was going to leave so soon, and he is rushing me. The bloodletting has restored life to my head. I will soon be well, if God so wills.
2. What made me so happy is that you are going to live with the friars, since you have to stay in Madrid. But be careful, padre, for they will weigh all your words. For love of God, be cautious and not so candid. I truly believe what they say about Tostado, for if he is prudent he will not come until he receives the consent of the one you mention. Thus, he wants to obtain it with your help. I've never seen anything so charming. Now I have received the letters that you told me you had sent, and yesterday that one from our padre.
3. As regards Padre Fray Baltasar, certainly I have written to him, and more than once. As long as you live with the friars, you will be doing very well to stay in Madrid. Continue to please the nuncio as you are now doing, for after all he is our superior, and everyone appreciates obedience.
There's no more time.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus To the Very Magnificent and Reverend Señor Licentiate Villanueva.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Your letters brought me much distress. To think that in one of these houses things are worse than they are in any of the",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,4,0,1,1,11,0,4,20,1,0,1,7,8,5,6,6,3,2,0,1,1,2,1
"207",1569,4,"houses of calced nuns in Andalusia is like a death to me. I have had little luck with that house in Malagón. I don't know what terrible things the presider is doing to them that they should behave in the way you say they do in your letter to Mother Prioress. That which a superior like our padre said to them should have been enough to smooth things over. Their lack of intelligence is clearly evident and I cannot fail to blame you, for I know that you can do so much with them. If you had done what you did when they were tempted to rise up against Madre Brianda, things would be different.
2. What they will gain from all of this is that they will not see her again, even if God restores her to health, and will be left without your assistance, for this is the way God pays those who serve him badly. And you will see where such contentious people end up who are so troublesome a trial to me, and I beg you to tell this to Beatriz. My feelings toward her are such that I wouldn't even want to hear her name mentioned. I ask you to tell her that if she starts to oppose the presider or object to anything that is done in the house and I learn about it, she will pay dearly. Out of love for God, teach the nuns, as you have always done, to embrace the Lord if they want to have peace and not be going about so disturbed. Do you fear that there are others like Ana de Jesús? Indeed, I would rather see them worse than she has been than disobedient. The sight of one of them offending God makes me lose all patience, and the Lord gives me very much patience in everything else.
3. As for the possibility of Ana de Jesús receiving communion, it is certain that she can, for the case has been carefully studied. Now that she is able to, let things stand for a month to see how it goes. In this regard, refer to what Mother Prioress writes to you. Your not having been informed was a great mistake. You did well to give her communion since you had no further knowledge.
4. As for the curate, this is why I was fearful about Fray Francisco's departure, for not even the provincial wants them to confess always with the same confessor; nor does this seem good to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,3,2,10,1,11,14,3,2,2,10,4,15,9,9,5,3,2,0,1,1,0
"208",1569,5,"me. I have already told you this. I regret the long conversations with the confessor. I will inform him of this because it is something to be careful about.
5. The presider told me that in a certain matter you were not in much agreement with her. She led me to think that you do not believe she is dealing openly with you. Her not being open with you seems wrong to me. I am going to write to her about this and other things in such a way that she will not know that you have written anything to me. It would be good if you spoke to her plainly and complain about how she acted with Ana de Jesús. If you do not disentangle what the devil has begun to put together, things will go from bad to worse and you will be unable to bear them with peace of soul. Although it will be distressing to me that you are leaving, I believe you are more obliged to preserve your own tranquility than to do me a favor. May the Lord grant us tranquility, as he can, amen.
I kiss the hands of those lords many times.
They say that even though the nuncio died, our padre's commission has not ceased and that he is still visitator. In certain respects I am very sorry about this.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress in Seville.
1. Jesus be always with your reverence, my daughter. Last month I wrote to you by way of a muleteer from this city, and my brother also wrote. In the letter I mentioned that our business matters had gotten complicated. You will have learned this from Padre Fray Gregorio in a more complete way than I could have then put in writing. Now, God be blessed, they are proceeding very well, better each day. Our padre is well, and he still retains his commission, although I would very much like to see him liberated from those people. They make up so many things that it would be impossible to put them all in writing. But the good part is that everything ends up raining down on their own backs and turns out to our benefit.
2. You will have already learned how Fray Miguel and Fray Baltasar retracted. Fray Miguel swears that he wrote nothing in the memorandum and that they made him sign it, with force and threats. He said this and other things in the presence of witnesses and a notary, and before",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,10,1,9,17,1,1,1,11,7,8,6,6,1,3,1,1,0,1,0
"209",1569,6,"the Blessed Sacrament. The king understood that this is evil and so they do nothing but harm themselves. My head is in a wretched state. Pray for me and for these brothers that God will enlighten them for the salvation of their souls.
3. I tell you that what is going on at the Incarnation is of a kind, I think, never before seen. By orders of Tostado the provincial of the calced friars came here fifteen days ago for the election with threats of great censures and excommunications for anyone who might cast a vote for me. Despite this, they paid no heed, and as though he had said nothing to them at all, fifty-five nuns voted for me. As each vote for me was given to him, he excommunicated the nun, and he cursed and pounded and beat the ballots with his fist and burned them. He has left the nuns excommunicated for fifteen days now without their being allowed to hear Mass or enter the choir, even when the Divine Office is being said. And they cannot speak to anyone, not even their own confessors or parents. And what is most amusing is that the day after this pounding election the provincial returned and called them together for an election, but they answered that there was no need for another election because they had already had one. And seeing this he excommunicated them again and called the remaining nuns, which numbered forty-four, and had them elect another prioress and sent the result to Tostado for confirmation.
4. Now she has been confirmed in office, but the others are holding fast and say they will not obey her except as a vicaress. Learned men say that the nuns are not excommunicated and that the friars are acting contrary to the Council in confirming a prioress who received an insufficient number of votes. The other nuns sent word to Tostado that they want me for prioress. His answer was no; if I wanted, I could go there to live in seclusion but it would be inadmissible for me to go as prioress. I don't know where it will all end up.
5. This, in sum, is what is happening now, for all are stunned to see something like this which offends everyone. I would gladly pardon the nuns if they would leave me in peace, for I have no desire to find myself in that Babylon -- and even less so because of my poor health. And it gets even",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,4,2,0,2,14,0,7,7,1,3,0,9,5,10,9,4,3,7,0,1,3,0,0
"210",1569,7,"worse when I'm in that house. May God do what serves him most and free me from them.
6. Teresa is well and sends you her regards. She is a lovely child and has grown a great deal. Pray for her that God may make her his servant. Let me know whether the widow has entered -- as has been my wish -- and whether her sister has returned to the Indies.
7. I have felt a longing to speak to you about many things, which would be consoling for me. But some day I will have more time and a safer messenger than the one who is going to bring this. Señora Doña Luisa is a great help and favors us in every way. Pray for her and for the Archbishop of Toledo, and don't ever forget the king. 1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. Oh, how long it's been since I've received a letter from you, and how far away it seems that I am up here. Even were I close, it would have been difficult to write you these past days because of all the turmoil going on, about which you will be informed in this letter. I tell you the Lord has not left me idle. Before I forget, with regard to the agnusdei, I would like to see it decorated with pearls. If something pleases you, you don't have to ask me about it, for I am happy if you are. May you enjoy much happiness.
2. I would have wanted that in the midst of those disturbances -- for they tell me the province is getting stirred up again -- the nuns in Paterna be brought back quickly; this is something I strongly desire. Our padre has written me that he wrote telling you to do this, with the consent of the archbishop. Try to obtain it before other hindrances arise.
3. Here they are reminding me to ask you for a little caraña because it's very helpful to me. It must be of pure quality. Don't forget, for goodness' sake. You can send it well wrapped to Toledo, for they will send it on to me. Or it's enough to entrust it to the man from here when he returns.
4. Don't fail to be most diligent regarding the nuns in Paterna, for apart from the nuns themselves, I would like this for your sake. I don't know how you've been able to get along without them. Now my companion will tell you the story",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,9,0,6,17,2,0,2,5,7,11,12,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
"211",1569,8,"of our trials.
5. Write and tell me whether you have paid for that house or have any money left and why you are in a hurry to move. Tell me about it all, for the prior of Las Cuevas is writing me about it.
6. You should know that the nuns at the Incarnation have been absolved after almost two months of excommunication in which they underwent much anguish. The king commanded that the nuncio give orders to absolve them. Tostado and his councilors sent a prior from Toledo for this purpose, and he absolved them with so many constrictions that it would take a long time to list them all, and he left them more disturbed and dejected than before. And all of this happened because they did not want the prioress the superiors wanted, but me. And the two discalced friars that had been placed there by the apostolic commissary and the previous nuncio were taken away and imprisoned as though they were criminals. I am terribly distressed and will be so until I see them freed from the power of those people. I would rather see them in the land of the Moors.
7. It is said that on the day they were captured, they were flogged twice. They are receiving the worst treatment possible. Maldonado -- the prior of Toledo -- took Padre Fray John of the Cross to present him to Tostado. The prior here took Fray Germán to San Pablo de la Moraleja. And when he returned he told the nuns that were on his side that he left that traitor in good hands. They said that blood was coming from his mouth as he was taken away.
8. The nuns are suffering over this, more so than from all their other trials, which are heavy. For goodness' sake pray for them and for those saintly captives, for tomorrow it will be eight days since they were seized. The nuns say they are saints and that in all the years the friars were there they behaved in every way like apostles. I don't know where the crazy ideas of those people are going to end up. May God in his mercy provide the remedy he sees as necessary.
9. Give my best regards to Padre Fray Gregorio. Tell him to have prayers said to God concerning all these trials, for it is a great pity to see what these nuns are suffering; they are martyrs. I am not writing to him, because I did so a",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,12,0,9,7,4,0,3,3,5,6,5,8,4,4,2,3,0,0,0
"212",1569,9,"short time ago. The letter for him went along with the one I sent you. My best regards to my Gabriela and to all the nuns. May God be with you all.
Today is 10 December.
10. I can't figure out how you are going to get the money to buy another house, for I don't even remember if the one you are in is paid for. It seems to me you told me the interest has been paid off. But if this postulant doesn't want to become a nun, she will clearly want her money back, especially if her sister gets married. Keep me fully informed about everything, for goodness' sake, for through Padre Padilla the letters arrive safely as long as they are sent to the archbishop. Or send them through our padre, and then they arrive sooner than when sent by way of Toledo.
11. If you have so much money, don't forget what you owe my brother. He is paying five hundred ducats interest on a property he bought. It would be a great help to him even if you sent only two hundred ducats, for he has received nothing from the Indies.
12. Let me know also how the uprising in the province is going and whom they made vicar, and give my regards to Padre Evangelista and tell him that God is giving him good opportunities for becoming a saint. Tell me all about your health and give me news about the nuns. And if you don't have time, let my Gabriela write me about it.
13. Many greetings to Beatriz and to Señor Garciálvarez; I was very sorry about his illness. My greetings to all the nuns and to Padre Nicolao. May God watch over you for me.
Your servant,
Teresa of Jesus
14. Be careful to take good care of your health, for now you see how important that is. Perhaps you will move to a house where you will roast alive. Consider the great comfort you have in the one you now occupy; and it is new. It could be that you will become so stubborn that I will let you buy one. I surely want you to be at peace. But you saw all the boasting about how good the first one was. 1. May the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. I received two of your letters a short time ago, the one that you wrote on the last day of carnival, and the other which contained a letter for the sisters from",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,10,12,1,2,18,0,1,0,9,5,11,13,8,3,0,0,0,4,0,0
"213",1569,10,"their pastor. Please God we will clothe him as well as you describe, but I believe he will give us much more than we will give to him. The little notebook is also very good.
2. I don't know how Paul can say that he doesn't know anything about the prayer of union, for that luminous darkness and the loving impulses lead one to the opposite conclusion. But afterward, since the experience goes away and is different, he does not completely understand it. I greatly envy the souls who will make progress through his help and am sorry to see myself here without doing anything else but eat, sleep, and talk about these fathers, our brothers. The occasion to do this is ever present as you will see from the enclosed page, for I asked Sister Catalina to write to you about what is happening so as not to tire myself, for it is late and we are going to have a sermon this evening by Maestro Daza who is a very good preacher. The Dominicans are very charitable toward us; they preach two sermons a week for us, and those of the Society one.
3. I often remember your sermons, and I don't know what it is that prompts you to go from place to place, for the latest calumnies against you really distressed me. May God watch over you, mi padre. The times have become so dangerous that it is temerarious to travel about from place to place, for there are souls everywhere. Please God that what appears to be much zeal may not turn out to be a temptation that will cost us dearly. In that place where you are, one cat would be enough, besides the other Franciscans and Dominicans that I think are there, although I cannot imagine that blessed man as preaching well. Give him my regards and let me know if they listen to him. But notice my curiosity! Don't tell me and tear this up lest because of my sins it fall into his hands. About your eating in the hospital and those miserable codfish pies, how you made us laugh! But the things they said about you make me hope you will be more careful in the future.
4. Carillo, in his response to my first letter to him in which I told him the devil was tempting him and many other things as well, is right in saying that I have little courage. He says my letter made him laugh and",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,13,0,7,16,2,2,1,13,10,4,8,2,3,5,1,2,2,0,2
"214",1569,11,"that it did neither little nor much to induce him to change his mind. He says I'm like a mouse afraid of the cats and that he made his promise while holding the Blessed Sacrament in his hands and that the whole world would not suffice to make him renounce it. I tell you this frightens me, for his brothers say that he and whoever clothes him in that habit will be excommunicated. He says he already has the permission from his provincial and that you wrote him a letter and that although, like a man, you are afraid, you write like an angel. And he is right, for your letter is like that.
5. His brothers are being difficult in asking that we not accept him. This must be because they don't think we can do so. Judging by their concern, I believe they may have already written you that you should inform the monasteries. They have pressed me so much that I told them I had written to you about the matter.
6. Really, if it must be done and it can be, as he says, it would be much better to have the deed done before informing the monasteries and all the resulting commotion. I don't know what you are going to do, but if the transfer is something possible, in conscience we would have to accept him. I truly believe from the way in which he describes his situation that no one will block him, and so it would be better to delay if nothing has been done yet. May the Lord direct matters, for the more that obstacles are placed before him, the more it seems to me that God will be served and that the devil wants to prevent this from happening. They must be afraid that he will not be the only one. But they are so numerous that the loss of some will not matter, even if it be of those you mention.
7. In what you write about Paul's scruples, whether or not he can use his power, it seems to me that he was the prey of a little melancholy when he wrote that letter and is so whenever he has scruples. The reasons he gives for using his power are clear, and so I do not want to inquire again about the matter. From what Ardapilla says, these doubts will not last long, for the memorandum from the great angel has been sent by Gilbert and is expected any day.

"215",1569,12,"I was pleased about Elías's fears over your absence. There is everything to fear over one who takes these risks. May it please the Lord to free Paul from them, for their blindness is so great that nothing they might do would surprise me. What worries me more is the one who does not fear and goes from place to place without necessity.
9. Returning to what I was saying, I already wrote to Paul some time ago that a very learned Dominican whom I told about all that happened with Methuselah, informed me, I believe, that it had no binding force. He told me that Methuselah was obliged to show his authorization for doing what he did. For the present there is no need to be talking about it any further.
10. I would like to send you a letter from the prioress of Valladolid in which she speaks of the commotion stirred up by the Carillo matter. Well, she thinks the Jesuit Fathers are very content with me and the discalced nuns. I think that all the threats will come to naught. What worries me and makes me fear and what I wish you would examine carefully and clarify is whether he can do what he wants without offending God or incurring excommunication. For if what the Jesuits say is true, you can in no way accept him. If the Count of Tendilla goes to Rome -- and even if he doesn't go personally -- I believe that the permission will certainly be granted, judging by the report he is writing.
11. I was delighted with our good luck that he is going to Rome, for our friars can go along with him. May the Lord direct it all and protect you for me. I don't know if I answered everything, for I don't have any more time. But see how brief I am when I don't have time!
12. All the nuns ask for your prayers and have been delighted with the tasks you are giving them. I have not seen Doña Guiomar; only rarely does she come here, for she is very sick.
Today is the second of March.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and true daughter -- especially the latter, for I am hardly this with the other fathers.
Teresa of Jesus
13. I am very sorry that Padre Mariano feels so weak. Make him eat well and don't let him think at all about going to Rome, for his health is more important. Oh, how long it is taking your sister",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,9,0,11,19,7,2,0,13,5,10,13,10,3,3,1,0,4,0,1
"216",1569,13,"to come and how much she is desired!
My Isabelita is doing very well, they tell me. 1. Right after I received Communion, on the second day of Lent, in St. Joseph's at Malagón, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared to me in an imaginative vision, as He usually does. While I was gazing upon Him, I saw in place of the crown of thorns a crown of great brilliance on His head, there where the wounds must have been made.
Since I am devoted to this episode of the Passion, I was very much consoled and began to think how great the torment must have been since there were so many wounds; and I became afflicted. The Lord told me that I shouldn't grieve over those wounds, but over the many that were now inflicted upon Him. I asked Him what I could do as a remedy for this because I was determined to do everything I could. He told me that now was not the time for rest, but that I should hurry to establish these houses; that He found his rest with the souls living in them; that I should accept as many houses as given me since there were many persons who did not serve Him because they had no place for it; that those houses I founded in small towns should be like this one, for, by desire, as much could be merited as in the other houses; that I should strive to put all the houses under the government of a superior; that I should insist that the interior peace not be lost through a concern for bodily sustenance; that He would help us so nothing would be lacking; that the sick especially should be cared for; that a prioress who did not provide for and favor the sick was like Job's friends; that He made use of the scourge for the good of souls, and that in such an event they should practice patience; and that I should write about the foundation of these houses. I thought of how in regard to the house at Medina I never understood anything in a way that I could write of its foundation. He told me that that was all the more reason to write of it since He wanted it to be seen that the Medina foundation had been miraculous. He meant that He alone founded that house, since it had seemed absolutely impossible to found. And as a result I decided to write about the",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,8,0,6,1,3,17,0,0,3,13,20,22,4,7,3,0,0,2,6,1,0
"218",1570,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. God reward you for favoring me with your letter and the news of your plan to come here with Señora Doña María. You will be most welcome.
2. You are right to be happy, for I don't know what greater fortune God could give you than to call your daughter to a state where in serving His Majesty a person can live with more peace than anyone can imagine. I hope in the Lord that this will be for his great service.
3. On the one hand, I long for you to come, like someone who for a long while has had no cause for any great joy. On the other hand, I don't like to think of you having to undertake such a long trip when you could be excused, for I desire your health more than my satisfaction. I am writing to our Father Visitator about this and about his coming with you, for there are many drawbacks to it. What he decides will be the best thing to do.
4. May it please the Lord to deliver us from these times in which we have to fear even what is very good, for eyes full of suspicion are watching. The letter you said you wrote me, I never got.
5. All these sisters and the prioress kiss your hands. They very much look forward to your coming and that of Señora Doña María. May the Lord direct everything according to what best serves him. In Valladolid they are already getting the material for her habit.
6. May His Majesty watch over you and the Lord Secretary. I kiss your hands and the hands of all those ladies, especially of Señora Doña Adriana, although she has very much forgotten me.
Today is April 17.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
7. My Isabel de Jesús is already writing to me; there is no end to the nuns' happiness with her, and rightly so. I already know what is taking place there and that Christ our Lord and his most Blessed Mother have ordered you to subsidize two feasts, one in honor of the Blessed Sacrament and the other in honor of the Nativity of Our Lady. Do so, for this is pleasing to God and I take special pleasure in it. For mi padre, Maestro Fray Padre Jerónimo Gracián.
1. Jesus be with your paternity, mi padre. I had a strong desire to write you a long letter in response to the",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,17,0,2,31,2,0,0,6,2,5,9,5,4,1,5,6,1,2,0
"219",1570,2,"one you sent me so filled with pessimism and melancholy, but since I had these others to write, which I am enclosing, my head can no longer function. Please have the address put on the enclosed letter to the nuncio, for I'm not doing so lest I make a mistake. One of the ladies there could do it, one whose handwriting may be more like mine.
2. Regarding what I said in the beginning, my Paul is very foolish to have so many scruples. You ought to tell him this. There is nothing to say regarding you. All the learned men say that until he receives notification of the brief your conscience is clear. It would be folly to submit to the nuncio before the president has smoothed the way for you. And the first time you speak to the nuncio you should do so if possible in the presence of the president.
3. Don't go about prophesying, for goodness' sake, for God will do all things well. Now I understand all that Joseph said to me during the absence of Ardapilla, that this was more fitting for our business matters. I don't doubt it since he is so disliked. As for those other hermits, there's no need to pay any attention, for just as God wants evil to be discovered so does he reveal what is good. Mass is not obligatory for you. I inquired about this, but you know the answer yourself. Try to stay there, in great secrecy however. This is what worries me. If while having so good a life you become this pessimistic, what would you have done had you had to suffer what Fray John did?
4. The money will be paid to Antonio Ruiz. If he has not gone, tell him that I already have a hundred bushels and that it is necessary to send the money from Malagón at once; and that is where his bushels will be sent. I haven't the head for writing any more, my good padre. Remain with God, and since you serve as great a lady as is the Blessed Virgin, who prays for you, don't be troubled about anything, although I see you clearly have reason to be troubled.
Warm regards to Señora Juana.
Teresa of Jesus
Tell the president that we are diligently praying to God for his health. 1. ... the truth of all the letters she writes to him, whereas at first he wrote to her quite frequently and treated her favorably. Nor does he write to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1,5,9,0,12,13,2,1,4,10,5,11,10,8,1,5,2,2,2,1,0
"220",1570,3,"or deal with the other monasteries, but acts as though he were not their superior. Obviously they must have said things to him that drove him to such an extreme.
2. What is requested from his most reverend paternity are three things very important for those monasteries. First, if possible, that he become persuaded not to accept as true what they have told him about Teresa of Jesus, for truly she has done nothing but be a very obedient daughter. This is the whole truth and nothing else can be said against her. And since he knows that she would not tell a lie for anything on earth and he has seen for himself what prejudiced persons are likely to do and that they do not communicate with her, he must try to be correctly informed. And since he is the shepherd, he must not condemn unjustly without hearing all sides. If, nonetheless, only what they have said carries weight, may it lead him to apply the penalty and punish her and give her a penance so that she no longer remain in his disfavor. For any punishment would be easier for her than to see him angered. Parents are wont to forgive their children for even serious faults, all the more when there aren't any. But she has instead suffered many great trials in founding these monasteries, meaning to please him. For apart from his being her superior she has the greatest love for him. Let him not allow so many servants of God to remain in his disfavor since nobody places any blame on them. Let him consider them to be his daughters as he always has and recognize them as such, for their works deserve this.
3. Second, since the office of apostolic visitator has now terminated and these monasteries of discalced nuns are immediately under his lordship's jurisdiction that he assign superiors to whom they may have recourse whether for visitations or for the other many things that surface; and that these superiors be from among the discalced friars of the primitive rule, and that he not order them to be governed by the friars of the mitigated rule, because their way of life in many respects is very different from that of these latter friars, and it is impossible for anyone not living as they do to be able to understand and offer a remedy for any faults that exist. He knows how poorly they did under these friars. And whenever he pleases, he may",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,9,0,9,15,0,5,1,10,9,8,16,11,2,4,1,0,2,1,1
"221",1570,4,"inquire about how badly the task has been carried out by the friar he has ultimately appointed and whom the nuns themselves chose as the best. And this perhaps is not the fault of that friar but due to the fact that he has no experience of the life, as I said, which causes much harm. Furthermore, setting this aside, both apostolic visitators have issued statutes prescribing that the discalced nuns be subject to his lordship and to the one appointed as his representative, who should be a friar living under the primitive rule -- I mean a discalced friar -- in view of the harm that resulted from the opposite procedure.
4. If he does not agree to this, it should be explained to his most reverend paternity -- not as something coming from the discalced nuns, but as a surmise -- that, since his lordship is so far away, they would rather be subject to their bishop than agree to be governed and visited by the calced friars. These latter could cause much harm before any remedy comes, as he already knows has happened. And this in part has been the reason why our houses have not resisted the visitators, which as reformed they could have done; they did not want to find themselves subject to the calced friars, having learned their lesson.
5. You must not even speak of this unless, after having insisted strongly on the preceding point, you find that his lordship still does not want to heed the nuns. For indeed it would be an indescribable torment for them to have to cease being subject to our Father General, unless they would otherwise end up lost and without protection. Apart from the fact that they are highly esteemed both by the king and by people of high rank, there are women of quality among them, and they are not lacking the money for their needs. All of these monasteries are now established and they are not in need, and some of them were founded by illustrious persons. May God not allow them to be drawn into a situation in which they would be required to withdraw from so good a shepherd. God forgive the one who has sown such a weed. This is a most important point, which, for love of our Lord, you must highly stress.
6. Once a province for the discalced friars is established, the monasteries of nuns will always be entrusted to the provincial. Even though their conversation in these monasteries",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,15,0,6,8,1,0,1,10,9,17,8,7,1,2,0,0,3,1,0
"222",1570,5,"is with God alone, it would be opportune if, in matters pertaining to mortification and perfection, they were placed, if possible, under the authority of Padre Maestro Fray Jerónimo de la Madre de Dios Gracián. He has been a visitator these past years; and with his spirit and discretion and gentleness, so perfect and upright that it seems the Blessed Virgin has chosen him, these nuns will make great progress. In every visitation they say they experience a renewal of their desires and many benefits.
7. If this could be done, it would be what is most fitting, and none of them would say anything else. But it seems to be impossible, for the most reverend general is very displeased with him also, as he is with Teresa of Jesus, and even much more so for reasons that will be mentioned when the rest of the facts are stated. He is the one who has been apostolic visitator by order of the previous nuncio and the king. And considering the calumnies they raise against him, it is no wonder that the general is so aloof.
8. It would be of great service to God if this could be brought about, but it seems impossible. So it is necessary to name other friars, either Padre Presentado Fray Antonio de Jesús or Padre Fray John of the Cross, for these two fathers were the first discalced friars, and they are very great servants of God. And if he should not want either of them, let it be anyone his lordship might appoint, as long as he not be a calced friar or an Andalusian. Do as much as possible, for as time passes, another course of action, with the help of the Lord, may present itself. It will be great at first just to be free from the calced friars.
9. Any of these visitators, whoever he may be, in recognition of the most reverend general, must take care when making the visitation each year to send the ordinary taxes to the general; and if he does not do so -- but he will because he is obliged to -- the monasteries will send it. If the monasteries are given Padre Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián as visitator, they will double the amount, and if they even gave much more, they would gain because of how important this is to them. It goes without saying that what was just said should not be mentioned except to a companion of the most reverend general after",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,11,0,1,14,0,0,1,7,6,22,26,6,0,4,0,0,0,1,0
"223",1570,6,"finding out who is closest to him. And it would be well to speak first with him about all that was said. It would be most important to win by words and deeds the favor of those close to him so that the effort will bear fruit.
10. The third request is that his lordship be pleased not to bind the superior who governs these monasteries more rigidly than are those of all the other religious orders. For if they are given a monastery or a house for the religious life or procure one themselves for nuns, they have the power to bring some nuns there so as to begin the foundation. Without this provision, the order could be poorly planted. And never has a general been opposed to this for his order; rather generals help and rejoice that new foundations are multiplying, as the most reverend general of the Carmelite order used to do before he was so badly informed. One does not understand what could have been said to him about people who are so religious, and give and have given such good example, and went with so much modesty and piety to live in the monasteries, that he should take from them a good that all religious orders enjoy, as was said.
11. In the general chapter, the most reverend general gave orders that, under pain of excommunication, no nun should leave her monastery and that prelates should not consent to her doing so, especially Teresa of Jesus. The latter, when a house was ready, went with some nuns to establish the observance of the order there and take possession of the house in accordance with the patent letters that had been given her by the most reverend general with the greatest zeal. Those who saw these foundations were edified as will be seen if more information is necessary ... To the very magnificent Señor Roque de Huerta, chief forest guard of His Majesty.
Jesus be always with your honor, amen. I received your letter and because I am sending you a reply by another route, I will not be long. I only beg you to let me know through this carrier if you have received my letters and how many. I wouldn't want them to get lost as they are very important. I worry until I know that they have been delivered into your hands. So, through the first messenger let me know and do me the favor of giving the enclosed from my brother to Captain",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,1,17,0,4,15,2,0,1,7,6,13,12,6,2,4,1,1,2,0,1

May our Lord grant you his holy grace. Give my regards to Señora Inés and t1. My lady, you should know that for a long time in all his prayer and with great desires he was asking for trials from our Lord. I saw in this that His Majesty was disposing him for those that he had to give him. And what trials they have been! Blessed be God's name. Now he must find that his soul has so benefited that he doesn't recognize himself. He has enabled us all to receive benefit greatly. I have had very much in mind the pain you both have suffered; but you, too, will have drawn gain from this.
2. When I see that the ones still detained have also been released -- and we will certainly see them free because they will not have so many accusers -- my happiness will be complete. For I am sure, as I said, that our Lord will take care of the negotiations that matter most. There are so many good souls begging this of him, and he will do what contributes best to his glory and service.
3. May His Majesty guide and keep you and the lord secretary as well, whose hands I kiss along with the hands of all those ladies. The sisters here kiss your hands. They are very happy with what has been done. I also am because of what I mentioned. Nonetheless, all of us have to do some penance, for the letters from our padre were always good for our souls and we read them together as though they were sermons. Even this the devil wants to take from us. God is over all.
Today is the feast of the Holy Innocents.

Today is Sunday, 28 December.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. ... All the nuns in this house send you their best regards. I am not surprised by the holiness they attribute to your paternity, but I would be surprised by the contrary considering all the prayers that have been said by such good people, and I believe these daughters of yours are indeed so. But how many changes of superiors our Lord has delivered us up to, and how many fears for me! I tell ...

"225",1570,8,"God who is pleased that we so pass our lives! What you are going through adds greatly to my pain. God forgive you for the days you made me go through with your fevers and blood spitting. And they tell me you have been suffering like this for some time. I don't know why it is that you did not let me know. I tell you, mi padre, that I feel so provoked that I don't know how I will manage to say a good word to you, for although I ... For Madre María de San José, in the monastery of the discalced Carmelite nuns in Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. I don't know how you can be silent for so long a time when at every moment I am wanting to hear how you are doing. I tell you I am not being silent here in what regards your house.
2. You should know that Padre Nicolao is here, for he is prior of Pastrana and came to see me. His visit was a wonderful consolation and I praised our Lord for having given our order a person like this, who is so virtuous. It seems His Majesty chose him as the means to set things right in your house, judging from the effort he has made and the cost to him. Pray much to our Lord for him, because you all owe this to him.
3. And, my daughter, set aside those foolish notions about perfection that lead you to refuse to be prioress again. We are all working and hoping to bring this about, and you come along with this childishness -- and there is no other name for it. This is a matter that pertains not just to you but to the whole order. It is so fitting for the service of God that I wish it were already done -- also for the honor of your house and that of our Padre Gracián. And even if you had no capacity for this office, no other solution would be suitable; even more so, since ""for want of good men ..."" as they say.
4. If God grants us this favor, just be silent and obey. Do not speak a word; think of how angry you will make me. What you have said is enough for letting us know that you do not want the office. And truly anyone who has such experience doesn't need to be told",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,6,0,3,2,13,0,4,16,0,1,1,12,14,10,6,5,1,8,1,2,2,0,0
"226",1570,9,"anything in order to understand that it is a heavy cross. God will help you; the storm has passed for now.
5. I very much want to know whether those nuns are aware of what they have done (or are they denying it in some way -- for I am worried about the state of their souls), and how they are getting along. For goodness' sake give me a long report about everything. If you send the letters to Roque de Huerta through the archbishop, they will be sent to where I am. Sister Isabel de San Pablo will write now about what is happening here, for I don't have time.
6. Give my regards to my daughter Blanca, with whom I am very pleased; I feel obliged to her father and mother for all they have done for you. Thank them for me. I assure you that what happened in your house is a story that frightens me, and I desire that you write telling me everything about it clearly and truthfully. Tell me now especially about how those two sisters are behaving; as I have said, I am very worried about them.
7. Give my regards to all the sisters and to Mother Vicaress. She can read this letter as though addressed to her. And I also send best wishes to my Gabriela. I haven't found out how Sister San Francisco behaved in all this business.
8. They are calling me now for Padre Nicolao, and tomorrow I am leaving for Valladolid; our Father Vicar General has sent me orders that I go there at once, and from there to Salamanca. There was little need for me in Valladolid, but this was requested by Doña María and the bishop. In Salamanca the need is great, for they are in that house which is very unhealthy, and they are undergoing much difficulty from the one who sold it to them. The trouble, the daily confrontations, and what they have undergone because of him is great, and this still goes on every day. Pray to our Lord that a good house can be bought at a low price. May His Majesty watch over you for me, my daughter, and allow me to see you before I die.
Today is 24 June.
9. I am leaving tomorrow. I am so busy that I cannot write to those daughters of mine. Let me know if they received a letter from me.

"228",1571,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. Angela is still unable to put her suspicions entirely to rest. It is no wonder that she does not find relief in anything, nor does her will allow her any, and, from what she says, has many trials. Nature is weak, and so she feels disturbed when she sees she is being badly repaid. You should tell that gentleman, for goodness' sake, that although he is by nature careless, he should not be so with her. Where love is present, it cannot be asleep for so long a time.
2. This aside, I am sorry about the mental fatigue you are undergoing. For the love of God, cut down on your workload. If you do not attend to this in time, you will see later that you will not be able to find a remedy even though you may want to. Learn to be your own master, avoid extremes, and profit from the experience of others. This is how you serve God, and try to see the need we all have for you to be in good health. I greatly praise His Majesty at seeing the good results of our negotiations, for by his mercy we can consider them concluded. We have so much authority supporting us that it truly seems that it is God who has thus arranged matters. Apart from the essential thing, I am happy that you will see the fruit of your labors. I tell you that through them you certainly paid dearly for it. Your joy will be great when everything has calmed down and those who come after us receive the great benefit.
3. Oh, mi padre, how many trials this house costs me! And after everything was done, the devil so arranged things that we were left without it. And it was the house that was most suited for us in all Salamanca, and the owner profited by our presence. You cannot trust these sons of Adam. He was the one who made us the offer, one of those gentlemen who they say here is most honest, and all agreed that his word is as good as when put in writing. Not only did he give his word, but he signed an agreement before witnesses and brought the notary himself. Later he nullified the contract. Everyone is amazed, except those other gentlemen who urged him to do this for their own or their relatives' profit. And they were able to influence",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,2,5,9,0,9,27,3,1,1,9,8,5,9,9,5,2,1,1,3,2,1
"229",1571,2,"him more than those who tried to reason with him. And a brother of his spoke with us in great charity, and he is very disturbed over the matter. We have recommended all this to our Lord. This must be what is best for us. My regret is that I find nothing else of worth for us in Salamanca.
4. In fact, if these sisters had the house that the sisters in Seville have, they would think they were in heaven. I regret the foolishness of that prioress, and she has lost much credit in my eyes. I fear that the devil has begun to meddle in that house and wants to destroy it completely. I tell you that if this lady, whose letter made me happy (I mean the one you sent me through Señora Doña Juana), meets with your satisfaction -- they told me down there that she is admirable -- I want to please her and receive her there when God wills that someone be there to do so. For I observe in that house a greed that I cannot bear. The prioress is shrewder than her state requires. So I fear that she is deceiving us; and, as I told her, she has never been open with me. She has a lot of the Andalusian in her. I tell you, I had to suffer a lot from her when there. Since she has often written to me with great repentance, I thought she had made amends, which seemed evident. To put it into the poor nuns' heads that the house is unhealthy is sufficient for them to think they are getting sick. I have written terrible letters to her, but I might as well be trying to make a dent in iron. You can see for yourself from this letter that Padre Nicolao has now written me.
5. For the love of God if you think you can influence her, write to her through some other friar. I think it would suit us well if we sent some other nuns there who would carry more weight and deal with such serious business matters in a befitting way. Tell Padre Nicolao to write to the prior at once, so as not to allow her to speak any more of this, for he must bear much of the blame for what is happening. I certainly think it is wrong to allege that the house is the cause for one's being sick. But it will be unhealthy for the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,5,6,7,0,15,14,3,3,4,10,8,13,13,8,2,2,1,2,4,1,1

6. Padre Nicolao gave me your regards, but I would not want you to forget to recommend me to our Lord in your prayers; you have so much to do that you could forget. My health is fairly good. The prioress and sisters here send their best regards. May God watch over you and allow me to see you. It is past three o'clock, and I haven't recited Prime.
Today is the feast of St. Francis.
Your unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus You should know that I am not the same when it comes to governing. Everything is done with love. I don't know whether this is because I have no reason for acting otherwise, or because I have come to understand that things are better dealt with in this way. For Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's in Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. Today, 8 February, I received the last letter that you wrote me, which was the one dated 21 January.
2. I felt the greatest distress over the mishap of our holy prior; and if he dies from this accident, I'll feel it more than if God were to call him because of age or illness, which I don't think would cause me so much grief. Now I know this is silly, for the more he suffers the better this is for him. But when I recall what I owe him and the good that he has always done for us, I can't get over feeling that a saint will be gone from earth while those who do nothing but offend God live on. May His Majesty give him what is most fitting for his soul, for this is what we ought to ask, we who owe him so much, instead of thinking about what the house will be losing. We are all praying fervently for him. I am also distressed that I don't know where you can write me about his health, to La Roda or Villanueva de la Jara (which is nearby). It will be a miracle if God leaves him here on earth for us.
3. You perceive it as diffidence on the part of the monasteries that they did not write to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,18,2,7,9,2,2,3,14,6,9,11,3,4,0,3,0,3,1,1
"231",1571,4,"you. If they had, it would have been a courtesy we ought to avoid. But you should know that they were very diligent about praying for all of you and felt very sorry. When I told them what the Lord had done to correct everything, they were greatly consoled. But the prayers were so many that I believe you will begin to serve God in that house with an entirely new fervor, for prayer is always efficacious.
4. I have been sorry about the illness of the new subprioress, for I thought she was as healthy as usual. And this is also what made me want her to be subprioress, that she relieve you of some work. When one feels like that, it is very beneficial in this region (on the advice of good doctors) to drink four or five sips of rose water. It does me much good, and orange blossom water does me much harm; although the scent of orange water is beneficial for the heart, but it's not good to drink it. Give her my best regards. Despite everything, I hope in God she will carry out the office well. Always give her authority and punish those who in your absence do not obey her as they would you. You have to give her authority, and that is very necessary.
5. I have always been a bit suspicious of that little Leonor. You do well to proceed with caution -- I mean suspicion -- that she will pay heed to her relative. The elderly one seems to me to be very balanced. And it is for her that I have felt most sorry. Give her my best regards.
6. I have written you a long letter through Serrano, for he told me he was going to leave for Seville soon. He cannot get used to it here. Look after him, for the licentiate has told me that he told him he wants to go to the Indies. This has been weighing on me, for it is a foolish idea. I will never finish thanking him for the fidelity that he showed all of you there in a time of so much need. I also wrote through him to Padre Nicolao, and I don't believe he has left yet. I wish I had the letters here. I have already written you at length about this foundation on which I am going.
7. In one of them, I believe, I wrote to Father Prior not to go ahead with buying a",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,4,2,1,2,6,0,9,12,3,1,0,13,4,10,6,11,3,0,3,1,3,0,6
"232",1571,5,"house without your first seeing it and seeing it again and again, for the superior will give permission for this at once. Remember what happened there and how poorly those fathers understand what is necessary for us nuns in such situations. All things take time, and how true is the saying, ""whoever doesn't look ahead ..."" Always keep before your eyes what the devil did to destroy that house, and the trials it cost us, so that you don't move without having consulted many and having thought the matter over well. In business matters, I wouldn't trust much the prior who is there. And don't let it ever cross your mind that there is anyone who would be more delighted if all of you were well situated than myself. And always realize that it is more necessary that the house have nice views than that it be in a good place -- and an orchard if possible.
8. The discalced Franciscan nuns in Valladolid thought that they had done very well by getting a house near the chancery and they moved from their former place. They were left, and still are, very much in debt and are most disturbed, for they feel as though they are in a cave, and they don't know what can be done; they can't make the least sound without being heard. I certainly love you more than you think, that is, tenderly, and so I desire that you do the right thing in all matters, especially in one so serious. The bad thing is that the more I love the less I can bear any mistake. Now I well know that this is foolish and that by making mistakes one gains experience. But if the error is serious, one is left with nothing, and so it is well to proceed cautiously.
9. I feel very sorry that you have to pay interest, for doing this is a wearisome thing and produces nothing. But since it is Father Prior's opinion, it must be the best you can do. May it please the Lord to provide a solution for you soon; this is very disquieting. I greatly wish my brother could wait. Were he to see that you are in need, I know that even though his is great he would wait. Certainly I have never told him that you received something from the Indies. He has a good deal of interest that he has to pay, and in Valladolid he has sold a part of what",3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,4,7,4,0,10,22,1,1,0,12,7,13,10,13,6,3,2,1,1,2,0
"233",1571,6,"you are giving him, which is worth a thousand ducats in Seville, and here one hundred ducats less. So he has gone to live in the small place he bought. He spends a great deal, and since he is accustomed to having more than enough and being the type who won't ask anyone for anything, he is worried. He has written me here twice concerning the matter. I am delighted about what you are doing, for he himself didn't ask you to give any more than a half of what you owe, if possible. Recommend this matter urgently to Father Prior.
10. You have been generous in what you have given to the order. May God reward you. No house has given so much, save Valladolid, which has given fifty more. And it comes at just the right time, for I didn't know what to do for our friars who are in Rome. From what they say, they deserve great pity. And this is the time now when they are most needed there. May God be praised for everything.
11. I sent the letters to Padre Gracián. He is writing to Padre Nicolao about it, according to what he wrote me. I was greatly relieved that we can at least write to him. Since he is going to be down there, my daughter, be careful about what you do. There is in your midst someone who is watching you. Recall the dangers we placed ourselves in because of a carelessness filled with good intentions. And if we have not corrected ourselves after this, I don't know what it would take, since this cost us so dearly. For the love of our Lord I beg you not to act otherwise. Since he is no longer visitator, we don't have to fear what they might give him to eat. There is no need of doing what we did when he was visitator.
12. I don't know how you can say that I guessed about the corporals that you made, for you yourself wrote to me about it in the letter brought by Serrano. Don't send them to me until I see a need for them. May God watch over you -- he who cares for all things -- and make you very holy.
13. Do not oppose or regret Father Prior's leaving, for until what is so important has been concluded, it is not right for us to be looking out for our own benefit. Always keep this in your prayers and me as",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,5,7,0,6,17,2,1,2,5,10,7,14,4,4,2,0,0,0,1,1
"234",1571,7,"well, for I now have more need of them so that this foundation will be successful. Consider greetings from the prioress and sisters as given, for writing tires me out.
Today is 9 February.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
If Padre Nicolao has left, tear up the enclosed letter for him. You may read it if you want, but then tear it up. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. Having been sick for many days, I put off writing this, although I have a great desire to know how your health is. Glory to God, I am now beginning to get better, although I am weak and my head is in a miserable condition. So, this is not written in my own hand. I beg you to write and tell me about the health of both you and Señora Doña María, whose hands I kiss.
2. You should know that the one hundred ducats have already been paid in Madrid. It made me very happy, as did also the knowledge that our two Romans are well and the business negotiations moving along nicely.
3. Let me know if you have heard anything about our friend, Licentiate Padilla.
4. I don't know where your answer to this might reach me, for I don't think I will be here long. You could send it to Segovia.
5. May our Lord preserve you with the holiness I desire, amen.
Toledo, 6 May.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus For my dear daughter Sister Teresa de Jesús.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your charity, my daughter. I was delighted with your letter, and that my letters make you happy is a great joy for me, seeing that we cannot be together.
2. As for the dryness, it seems to me that the Lord is now treating you as one who is strong. He wants to try you in order to know the love you have for him, whether it is present in dryness as well as in spiritual delights. Take it as a very great favor from God. Don't let it cause you any grief, for perfection does not consist in delight but in the virtues. When you least expect, devotion will return.
3. As for what you say about that sister, try not to think of it, but turn away from the thought. And don't think that when a thought comes into your mind, even if it concerns something very bad, you are immediately at fault, for the thought is nothing.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,3,14,1,5,30,1,0,2,15,5,12,12,2,1,2,4,3,5,2,0
"235",1571,8,"I too would like to see that sister experience the same dryness, for I don't know if she understands herself, and for her own good we could desire this. When some bad thought comes to you, bless yourself, or recite an Our Father, or strike your breast and try to think of something else, and you will instead be meriting because you will be resisting.
4. I would like to answer Isabel de San Pablo, but there is not time. Give her my best regards -- for she already knows how you must be the one dearest to me -- and also regards to Romero and María de San Jerónimo. I wish someone would write to me about her health, since she doesn't do so. Don Francisco is like an angel and doing well. Yesterday he received communion, and his servants did so too. Tomorrow we are going to Valladolid. He will write to you from there, for I haven't told him now about this messenger.
May God watch over you, my daughter, and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen. My regards to all.
Today is the feast of San Alberto.
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. After having written a letter, which your reverence will receive, Padre García Manrique sent me this one. Do not delay or be afraid to do what he asks for here, but go ahead and do so. When, surprised by your new decision, I wrote the letter, I thought that Pedro de la Banda had asked you for some documents and that Padre García Manrique had not been informed, and that is why I asked you to inform me if there is anything else. But I don't see any drawback to doing what he asks here; neither does Madre Inés de Jesús see any reason for your not doing so at once, nor does the prioress. So I beg you, for goodness' sake, to do so. And even if there is some drawback, it is enough that the agreement has at last been reached. Because it didn't seem so nice to us when they didn't keep their word -- the gentleman from Salamanca -- we wouldn't want to be imitating them.
2. Because I have gone on at greater length in the letter I mentioned, I'm saying no more than that may God give you a great love for him.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. ... Macario, for I don't think he knows how to conceal his temptation. I believe it is very",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,2,15,1,0,0,15,9,12,17,2,4,1,1,1,1,2,0
"236",1571,9,"important for that house of nuns that Fray Gabriel should remain in La Roda. I have already written to you about this. He has bought another house for them -- they say it is a very good one -- in the middle of the town. I am concerned, for I don't think it has any views or land. Would you inquire about Macario as though on your own initiative, and be kind to him, for he is a good man and has admirable qualities. If he is somewhat unpleasant toward you, I think it is because he is jealous and thinks you have more regard for others than for him.
2. It has also occurred to me that if you should remain as provincial you ought to chose Padre Nicolao as your companion. For it will be very important in these beginnings that you go about together, although I am not going to say this to the commissary. Since Padre Fray Bartolomé is so sick that he has to eat meat, some are already looking askance at him. At least in these beginning stages, Padre Nicolao, I tell you, would be the right one, and he has good advice to give in all matters. After having suffered so much from others you will enjoy not having anything to suffer from him.
3. Give my best regards to Padre Fray Bartolomé, who I believe must be very tired because of the way you live, never allowing yourself to rest. It is enough to kill you and anyone who accompanies you. I remember well the bad color of your face a year ago during Holy Week. For goodness' sake don't be in such a hurry to preach sermons this Lent, nor should you eat fish difficult to digest, for although you don't pay attention, it then makes you sick and the temptations come.
4. You should know that there is still talk about the chapel for Sancho de Avila and that there are learned men who think that despite the gift the right of inheritance remains. I really think there will be a lawsuit. I have said that no action should be taken on the matter until we have a provincial. I am mentioning this to you here -- even though it may seem out of place -- because it will be necessary that you inform whoever will be provincial not to take any action without going there and to be very careful, for it is important for that house. Sancho Dávila is",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,3,4,1,7,12,0,2,2,13,6,11,11,4,3,3,0,1,4,0,3
"237",1571,10,"now giving more, and the nuns are in such need of the chapel that I think it is something that should be done. But the conditions and many other things should be looked into and studied with me.
5. Here things are getting better every day, thanks be to God. We are considering a very good house, for the one next to the shrine of our Lady was not suitable. And it was expensive, so we did not take it. This other one is in a very good location. I am feeling better than usual, and all the nuns are well. San Bartolomé and Inés de Jesús send their best regards. The latter says that however much you flee from the trial, you must believe that the prayers of the discalced nuns will prove efficacious and place you in the midst of it. May the Lord guide you to what will be of the greatest service to him; the rest matters little, even though painful.
6. I wanted to be brief, and look at the result. I don't know how to keep things short with you. I spoke a great deal with Mariano about his temptation to vote for Macario, for he wrote to me about it. I don't understand that man, nor do I want to talk about this matter with anyone other than you. So what I have written about this is for you alone; that's very important. And don't neglect to have recourse to Nicolao and to let them know that you don't want the task for yourself. And truly I don't know how in conscience a vote could be given to anyone of those who will be there other than to either of you two.
7. I have already sent your letter to the monasteries. All of them are elated, and I even more so. I will send you their comments. If you receive messages from other places, accept the suggestions that seem worthwhile to you; otherwise there is no need to act on them.
May God watch over you and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen.
Today is 17 February.
8. If we should think of anything else regarding these houses, I will inform you. Surely the work of the chapter will not be over so quickly as to make this impossible.
Your Reverence's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus For my daughter, María Bautista, Valladolid.
1. ... I am very sorry and feel greatly distressed in seeing that the devil is striving in every way he",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,1,14,0,6,14,1,0,2,14,5,13,9,8,4,2,2,0,1,0,0
"238",1571,11,"can to do us harm. May our Lord set things right and give you good health, which is what matters.
2. I was sorry about the illness of María de la Cruz. God must want you to be a saint since he gives you the cross in so many ways. Those who suffer the illness she thinks she has never have a fever or that nausea, but appear to be strong and in good health.
3. The confessor did her great harm by not understanding her; I saw that. Inform the chaplain about this for me and give him my best. And do not allow Estefanía those times of solitude and fasting, if you don't want to end up with another similar case.
4. Doña Ana Enríquez has just written me, and I have felt very sorry about her trials. Well, this is the path on which those who want to enjoy him must walk, for it is the one he took. May he be with you and watch over you for me, amen. 1. All day yesterday I felt very lonely, for except when I received Communion I benefited little from the fact that it was Easter Sunday. At night when I was with all the Sisters, a little song was sung about how hard it is to endure life without God. Since I was already afflicted, the effect upon me was so great that my hands began to grow numb. My efforts to resist weren't enough; but just as I am carried out of my senses through the joyous raptures, so in the same way through extreme affliction my soul is suspended, for it is left enraptured. And even to the present day, I haven't understood this. Rather, for some days it seemed to me that I hadn't been experiencing impulses as great as I previously had, and now I think the reason is this one I mentioned. I don't know if it could be that previously the affliction wasn't great enough to make me go out of myself. Since it is so intolerable, and I was still in possession of my senses, it caused me to make loud cries without my being able to avoid doing so. Now, since the pain has increased, it has reached this extreme of transpiercing the soul. I have understood better what our Lady experienced, for until today -- as I say -- I did not understand the nature of this transpiercing. The body remains so torn apart that even what I write",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0,10,12,1,0,3,16,11,9,8,6,2,3,4,2,9,0,0
"239",1571,12,"today causes suffering, for my hands are as though disjoined and in pain.
2. Your Reverence can tell me when you see me whether pain can cause suspension and whether I experience it as it is or whether I'm being deceived.
3. Even this morning I felt the pain, for while in prayer I experienced a great rapture. And it seemed that our Lord brought my spirit next to His Father and said to Him; ""This soul You have given to Me, I give to You."" And it seemed the Father took me to Himself. This was not an imaginative vision, but it caused such great certitude and had a delicacy so spiritual that I don't know how to describe it at all. He spoke some words I do not recall; certain of them were about granting me a favor. It was for some time that He kept me near Him.
4. Since your Reverence went away so quickly yesterday (and I realize that your many occupations do not allow you time to be consoling me, even when necessary -- for I see that Your Reverence's duties concern more important things), I remained afflicted and sad for awhile. Perhaps the loneliness I mentioned contributed to this. Since I don't think I'm attached to any creature on earth, I felt some scruple and feared lest I begin to lose this freedom. This sadness happened last night. And today our Lord responded and told me I shouldn't be surprised, that just as human beings desire companionship in order to communicate about the joys of their sensual natures so the soul desires when there is someone who understands it to communicate about its joys and pains; and it becomes sad when there is no one. He told me: ""He is doing well and his deeds are pleasing to Me.""
5. Since our Lord remained some time with me, I recalled I had told your Reverence that these visions pass away quickly. He told me there is a difference between this one and the imaginative ones and that there couldn't be any fixed rule about the favors He grants us because sometimes it was fitting that they take place in one way and at other times in another way.
6. One day after receiving Communion, it seemed most clear to me that our Lord sat beside me; and He began to console me with great favors, and He told me among other things: ""See Me here, daughter, for it is I: give Me your hands."" And it",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,11,14,1,0,6,14,9,4,14,4,3,2,4,2,4,0,0
"240",1571,13,"seemed He took them and placed them on His side and said: ""Behold My wounds. You are not without Me. This short life is passing away.""
From certain things He told me, I understood that after He ascended to heaven He never came down to earth to commune with anyone except in the most Blessed Sacrament.
He told me that immediately after His resurrection He went to see our Lady because she then had great need and that the pain she experienced so absorbed and transpierced her soul that she did not return immediately to herself to rejoice in that joy. By this I understood how different was this other transpiercing, the one of my soul. But what must have been that transpiercing of the Blessed Virgin's soul! He also said that He had remained a long time with her because it was necessary in order to console her. 1. On the Tuesday following Ascension Thursday, having remained a while in prayer after Communion, I was grieved because I was so distracted I couldn't concentrate. So I complained to the Lord about our miserable nature. My soul began to enkindle, and it seemed to me I knew clearly in an intellectual vision that the entire Blessed Trinity was present. In this state my soul understood by a certain kind of representation (like an illustration of the truth), in such a way that my dullness could perceive, how God is three and one. And so it seemed that all three Persons were represented distinctly in my soul and that they spoke to me, telling me that from this day I would see an improvement in myself in respect to three things and that each one of these Persons would grant me a favor: one, the favor of charity; another, the favor of being able to suffer gladly; and the third, the favor of experiencing this charity with an enkindling in the soul. I understood those words the Lord spoke, that the three divine Persons would be with the soul in grace; for I saw them within myself in the way described.
2. While, afterward, thanking the Lord for so great a favor, finding myself unworthy of it, I asked His Majesty with deep feeling, why, since He was going to grant me favors like these, He had allowed me out of His hand to become so wretched? For on the previous day I had felt great suffering on account of my sins since they were in my mind. I saw clearly how",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,19,1,9,27,2,0,5,14,10,7,5,11,4,4,3,1,3,1,0
"241",1571,14,"much the Lord did on His part, from the time I was a little child, to bring me to Himself through very efficacious means, and how I didn't profit by any of them. Hence the excessive love God has in pardoning us for all this failure when we want to return to Him was made clearly manifest to me; and for many reasons this love was greater in my case than in anybody else's.
3. It seems those three Persons, being only one God, were so fixed within my soul that I saw, that were such divine company to continue, it would be impossible not to be recollected.
There is no need here to put in writing some other experiences and words that occurred in this state.
4. Once, a little before this, when I was about to receive Communion, and the host was still in the ciborium -- for it hadn't been given to me yet -- I saw a kind of dove that was noisily fluttering its wings. It so alarmed me and caused suspension of my faculties that much effort was required to receive the host. This all happened at St. Joseph's in Avila. Father Francisco de Salcedo gave me the Blessed Sacrament.
5. On another day, while hearing his Mass, I saw the Lord glorified in the host. He told me that Father Francisco's sacrifice was pleasing to Him. 1. Jesus be with your honor. I have no longer been sending letters with this messenger, yet I am delighted that he is here so that he can bring this letter from my brother which was given to me while I was at Vespers. Glory to God that he is well, and we can be sure now of his coming as you will see. Please God, Señor Juan de Ovalle is well. Since this messenger's coming was so certain, a few lines could have been sent to let me know how he is. I am fine, and everything is going well, glory to God.
2. It's only right that immediate steps be taken to obtain those documents and take possession. I don't know where that city is of which he speaks, whether it is far away. My brother will certainly know. Since as the saying goes, ""Wait no longer than a Creed and a messenger leaves for Madrid,"" try to act as quickly as possible to track down this lord, who must be involved with litigations, so that the documents will be ready. May the Lord intervene in everything and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,14,0,2,20,1,0,1,7,8,6,7,9,4,3,0,0,0,2,0
"242",1571,15,"make you very holy.
3. It seems to me the letter is from a brother-in-law of our uncle Ruy Sánchez's son. I will try to write through this messenger, for he must be reliable; and you, too, write to me.
Today is 9 March.
Regards to my dear children.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. This day, Quasimodo Sunday, 1564, Juan de San Cristóbal and Teresa of Jesus entered into agreement on the sale of a group of dovecotes for 100 ducats free of tithes or duties.
2. The amount will be paid in this manner: 10,000 maravedis now and 10,000 by Pentecost Sunday; the remainder will be paid by St. John's feast of this year.
In confirmation of the above, I place my signature.
Teresa of Jesus 1. One day after the octave of the feast of the Visitation while I was in a hermitage of our Lady of Mt. Carmel praying to God for one of my brothers, I said to the Lord (I don't know, perhaps I may have just thought it): ""Why is my brother in a place where his salvation is in danger? Were I, Lord, to see Your brother in this danger, what wouldn't I do to help him!"" It seemed to me that I would have left nothing undone in order to help.
The Lord answered me: ""Oh, daughter, daughter! These Sisters in the Incarnation are My Sisters, and you delay? Well, take courage; behold I want it, and it isn't as difficult as it seems to you. And whereas you think some harm will come to your houses, both they and the Incarnation will benefit. Do not resist, for My power is great."" 
1. The desires and impulses for death, which were so strong, have left me, especially since the feastday of St. Mary Magdalene; for I resolved to live very willingly in order to render much service to God. There is the exception sometimes when no matter how much I try to reject the desire to see Him, I cannot. 1. Once I heard: ""The time will come when many miracles will be worked in this church; they will call it the holy church."" It was in St. Joseph's at Avila in 1571. 1. O
nce while thinking about the severe penance Doña Catalina de Cordona performed and about how because of the desires for penance the Lord sometimes gives me I could have done more were it not for obedience to my confessors, I thought it might be better not to obey them any longer in this",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,4,19,1,6,10,0,2,1,11,8,8,11,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0
"243",1571,16,"matter. The Lord told me: ""That's not so; you are walking on a good and safe path. Do you see all the penance she does? I value your obedience more."" 1. Once while I was in prayer, the Lord showed me by a strange kind of intellectual vision what a soul is like in the state of grace. I saw this (through an intellectual vision) in the company of the most Blessed Trinity. From this company the soul received a power by which it had dominion over the whole earth. I was given an understanding of those words of the Song of Songs that say: Veniat dilectus meus in hortum suum et comedat. I was also shown how a soul in sin is without any power, but is like a person completely bound, tied, and blindfolded; for although wanting to see, such a person cannot, and cannot walk or hear, and remains in great darkness. Souls in this condition make me feel such compassion that any burden seems light to me if I can free one of them. I thought that by understanding this condition as I did -- for it can be poorly explained -- it wasn't possible for me to desire that anyone lose so much good or remain in so much evil. 1. On the eve of the feast of St. Sebastian, the first year in which I was prioress at the Incarnation, at the beginning of the Salve Regina, I saw the Mother of God descend with a great multitude of angels and sit in the prioress's choir stall where there was a statue of our Lady. In my opinion I didn't then see the statue but our Lady herself. It seemed to me she looked something like she does in the painting the countess gave me; although the power to discern this was quickly taken away, for my faculties were soon held in great suspension. It seemed to me there were angels above the canopies of the stalls in the back and above the front stalls; although they were not in corporeal form, for this was an intellectual vision.
She remained for the whole of the Salve, and she told me: ""You were indeed right in placing me here; I shall be present in the praises they give my Son, and I shall offer these praises to Him.""
2. After this I remained in the kind of prayer I now have, that of keeping my soul present with the Blessed Trinity. And it seemed to",2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,3,18,0,5,21,0,1,1,10,3,3,14,3,7,5,1,0,1,0,0
"244",1571,17,"me that the Person of the Father drew me to Himself and spoke very pleasant words. Among them, while showing me what He wanted, He told me: ""I gave you My Son, and the Holy Spirit, and this Blessed Virgin. What can you give Me?"" 1. On Palm Sunday after Communion, my faculties remained in such deep suspension that I couldn't even swallow the host; and, holding it in my mouth, after I returned a little to myself, it truly seemed to me that my entire mouth was filled with blood. I felt that my face and all the rest of me was also covered with this blood, as though the Lord had just then finished shedding it. It seemed to me warm, and the sweetness I then experienced was extraordinary. The Lord said to me: ""Daughter, I want my blood to be beneficial to you, and don't be afraid that My mercy will fail you. I shed it with many sufferings, and you enjoy it with the great delight you are aware of; I repay you well for the banquet you prepare me this day.""
He said this because for more than thirty years I have received Communion on this day when possible and have striven to prepare my soul to give hospitality to the Lord. For it seemed to me cruel of the Jews, after having given Him such an enthusiastic reception, to have let Him go so far away to eat; and I imagined I invited Him to remain with me, which was very bad lodging for Him, as I now see. Thus I made some foolish reflections. The Lord must have accepted them, because this is one of the visions I hold to be very certain; and so the Communion was beneficial to me.
2. Previous to this, I believe for three days, I underwent that great suffering I bear, sometimes more than at other times, of being separated from God. During these days it had been very great, for it seemed I couldn't endure it. Having been in such anguish, I saw one evening that it was too late to eat supper, and so I was unable to do so. (Because of the vomitings it made me very weak not to have my supper earlier). Thus with great effort I put the bread in front of me so as to force myself to eat it. At once Christ appeared there, and it seemed to me He broke the bread and was about to place it",2,11,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,12,0,9,17,2,1,3,11,8,5,9,5,2,3,2,7,3,1,8
"246",1572,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. I am tired and it is very late at night, so I will say no more than that the bishop came yesterday; and today arrangements were made for the procession, which was no small thing. It will take place in the afternoon with all the solemnity possible. We will go from here to San Lázaro. The canons will not celebrate the feast tomorrow except to take the Blessed Sacrament from there. I believe we will enter St. Clare's which is along the way. Everything would be nice if mi padre were here. So, I don't know what to say.
2. They also came from Soria this morning for us. But I think they will have to wait until Monday. I am well. The bishop was here all afternoon, showing such eagerness to help this order that it is something to praise God for. May His Majesty be with your reverence.
3. Give my regards to Padre Juan Díaz. All the sisters here send you their best. Padre Nicolao is well, and I the same. He preached a good sermon for us today.
4. I was delighted with Fray Juan de Jesús. The more I observe his love for you, the more I like him. Do not show him any dislike, for a good friend nowadays should be highly esteemed.
Your reverence's servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
Sister Isabel de Jesús is bringing this; in your charity show her much kindness. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Your letter consoled me greatly. May our Lord reward you. It didn't strike me as long. I would like to go on at length in this one, but so many letters have arrived together. Messengers so rarely come around here that I think it is better to be where you have ordinary mail delivery. Well, when God desires one to suffer, it doesn't do any good to flee.
2. In the letter I am writing to Catalina de Tolosa, I am telling the prioress, Inés de Jesús, to show it to you so that you learn the public reasons for the change in itinerary -- although I plan to tell you and Mother Prioress the other reasons as well -- for you say you would like to know the reasons for my change of plan, and you are right. If it were a matter of deep concern to the order, as was our becoming a separate province, one",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,15,0,3,25,0,0,2,10,6,7,8,4,0,3,0,0,1,1,0
"247",1572,2,"could surmount all difficulties, however numerous; but because I do not have time I will not expand. And if the journey lasted a day longer, but no more, it could be tolerated. But to go so many leagues on an adventure is something for which I see no reason whatsoever, for this order is not so fallen or in need of such a foundation.
3. Since I have been here, they have written me from two other cities where I am also refusing to go. One is Ciudad Rodrigo, and the other is Orduña.
4. To assume now what the archbishop will do is not wise in my judgment. For without wanting to be suspicious, we have seen clear reasons for being so. In what Canon Juan Alfonso writes me, the archbishop says that he always remembers the tumult that arose in Avila at the time of the first monastery. Despite the great good that came about as a result, he says that because of his experience he is obliged to prevent anything like this from happening again. What can be hoped for from this? Seeing that he fears what may never happen, it is clear that he will not give the permission when the devil stirs up some uproar; and I will appear frivolous for having gotten involved in it.
5. He also said to a member of the Society of Jesus that the consent of the city was wanting and that without it, or without an income, he would in no way give permission. Two persons have already told me that he has a very hesitant nature. If this is so we would be bringing him more trouble and, in the end, obtain nothing, as has been the case so far. But for something that is not an offense against God, after all that the Bishop of Palencia did in this regard, one should be ready to take every risk.
6. I have my reasons, mi padre, for what I say. If this is something to strive for, if we have to negotiate the matter with the city, it will be better to do so from afar and slowly. Since it is something that cannot be done in eight days or perhaps even a month, a miserable foundress would have to stay in the house of a secular, which would be the occasion for much talk. I consider it better to travel many leagues and then return here than to go through all the inconveniences that can arise. If God",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,6,0,9,9,5,1,1,7,9,16,20,8,3,4,0,0,0,0,0
"248",1572,3,"wants it, it will come about more gently, and he will succeed despite the devil, but it won't come by force.
7. Since it seems to me that I have done all that I could about this, I tell you truthfully that not even in its first stirrings did I feel any grief; rather I rejoiced -- I don't know why. Only when I read the letters of that blessed Catalina de Tolosa, who tried so hard, does it seem that I wanted to make her happy.
8. The designs of the Lord we do not understand, and it could be more fitting for me to go elsewhere now. So much resistance on the part of the archbishop contains some mystery, for I certainly think he desires the foundation. I haven't said anything about this to the bishop here, for he is so busy that he hasn't been able to see me these days. Nor do I think it necessary, for I feel so much repugnance toward telling him about these things. Rather I was surprised there were some who still thought it would be good to make the foundation, after what happened to the Bishop of Palencia. I am not going to speak of these things, but only of those about which I'm certain, such as the winter cold and the harm it would do to my health if we went at the beginning of winter. To the archbishop I am saying that I do not want to expose him to all this disturbance until the matter is negotiated with the city, and I thank him for the favor he shows me. May the Lord do what is most for his service.
9. The procurator didn't think it suitable for certain reasons to entrust our response with the same messenger, so we waited for this other one who is certainly going to Valladolid. Write to me truthfully what you think of these reasons that I have given. If they carry but little weight, I have many others. And it is my deep conviction that if I were to speak with you, you would agree.
10. I am very sorry about all the work you have to go through for those alms, but since it is all for the poor, I don't think you mind it. Apart from what you send, God will awaken other people to give, and little by little he will arrange everything. I didn't want you to neglect the collections in the villages, although some preacher from the",2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,0,1,8,1,6,15,1,0,2,14,11,15,13,12,1,4,5,0,1,0,1
"249",1572,4,"order should have gone to preach. For that reason, it could be that not so much will be collected this year.
11. May our Lord repay you for the advice you gave about the rent for this house. Before Padre Nicolao left, he drew up the contracts, and he did so well that while one thought of an income at only fourteen per thousand, as would have been possible, twenty were obtained; the act is already recorded. Padre Nicolao also brought the document to be registered in the name of the monastery.
12. Thank that little saint, the procurator, for what he is doing, for he will be very pleased if I mention this to you. He is a soul who I don't think is well known; so much humility cannot be present without much richness. May you give me permission to finish more willingly than I would you.
13. One thing I beg is that in all openness you let me know what you think of the prioress and how she acts and if there is need to give her some advice and how you get along with her, for she never finishes telling me what she owes you.
May our Lord watch over you and be pleased to permit me to see you again. I am well.
Today is 13 July.
Your honor's unworthy servant and daughter, even though the title bothers you,
Teresa of Jesus
14. I kiss the hands of Señor Don Francisco and anyone else's you wish me to, and my regards to San Miguel, in your charity. It matters little if they delay in changing the door of the sacristy. That they close the church early, I praise our Lord. I would like to see the grate put up. I hope in him that in this house of our Lady, she and her son will now be served with greater purity. More grates will be needed, and they could be brought from Burgos if necessary. And perhaps, if the little chapel of our Lady is built, the smallest grate will be needed there. I will try to find the means to pay for them if they are not available there. Every day I become more attached to that house; I don't know why. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your most illustrious lordship. I received two letters from you, a favor that was for me a great consolation. I kiss your hands many times. I have already obeyed the orders you gave me in them",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,6,15,0,1,18,0,1,0,10,7,17,16,5,3,0,2,2,0,2,0

As you will see from the enclosed letter, I hope in the Lord that she will bring much glory to our Lord and good to this holy order of his glorious Mother and that she will serve you more through her prayers; the more she grows in holiness, the more pleasing they will be to God.
2. I give great thanks to His Majesty in learning that you are in good health. May he be pleased that this continue for many years, a petition that all of these subjects of yours make to him. I have confidence that through these prayers he will grant us this favor, for I know that these are good souls praying for you. Since I am so wretched, I have little trust in my own prayers, although I keep you truly present, especially each day when I am in his presence.
3. Our Father Provincial went to give the habit and wrote to me of the great happiness this brought him.
From this house of St. Joseph's in Avila, 30 October.
Your most illustrious lordship's subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence. Today the nuns left, which was painful for me and leaves me feeling very lonely. The nuns don't feel this way, especially María de Cristo who is the one who wanted to go most. The plan had already been made public, but the other nun was not suited for this, as you will agree. Nonetheless, I felt very scrupulous since you were the one who told me to send her. Doctor Castro freed me of my scruples.
2. Fray John of the Cross was longing to send you some money and did a good deal of calculating to see if he could give something from what he brought with him for the journey, but he wasn't able to. I think he will get something to send to you.
3. Antonio Ruiz came here three or four days ago and was determined to go with me. He greatly desired to see you, and he is writing to you. He gave me two coins to send you that should be worth about four escudos. Of course, I will not send them to you until I have a safe messenger. I am doing all I can not to keep them for myself. The way things are going, it won't be long before I'm tempted to steal them.
4. Inés de Jesús sent me this enclosed letter",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,3,15,0,4,22,0,0,2,7,4,6,9,4,3,0,3,0,3,0,0
"251",1572,6,"with others of hers, but the departure will be too soon if it takes place after Christmas. I have already written her that you have to go down there and that they will have to wait. This blessed prioress has to act in such a way because she sees these ladies so filled with ardor. So don't promise to preach there after Advent, for you will have many occasions to do so here. Doctor Castro wants you to come and spend Christmas at his house, and I too; but few of my desires are fulfilled.
5. Now I believe we cannot fail to bring Teresica, for it seemed a good thing to the learned man I consulted, and she is taking my departure so hard -- especially after that of the other sisters -- that I think it will be necessary. She is going about a little sad and if some temptation were to assail her while in this state, I don't know what she would do. So it seemed to me well to give her some hope, even though I feel reluctant to do so. Glory to God who wants everything to rain down on me.
6. I am trying hard to see who to leave here in my place, and how well known the desire of Ana de San Pedro was to go. I cannot bear to think of leaving her in charge. It's a terrible thing, because otherwise I think she would do well. Mariana would do well, for she has many talents for the task, if Julián were not in the middle, although he is remaining quite apart for now and not interfering in anything. May God give you light; and when you are here, we will speak about everything.
7. The veil was given yesterday. Mother and daughter are as though mad with joy. It has all tired me very much and I didn't get to bed until two. Those I have designated were the three from here, three from Beas with Anne of Jesus, who goes as prioress, another two from Seville, and two lay sisters from Villanueva who are very good. But the prioress wrote me that it was fitting to send them because they have five lay sisters and it is right to want to help that house in Granada about which so many good things are said. This will not satisfy Anne of Jesus, who likes to direct everything. If it seems all right to you, hold to your decision, for no",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,1,9,0,5,15,1,1,2,12,4,13,13,6,2,2,3,0,2,0,0
"252",1572,7,"other better nuns will be found. If not, do as you think best, and remain with God, for I didn't get to bed until two o'clock and then rose early; my head is in bad shape. The rest is going reasonably well.
8. The drawback that now comes to mind is what to do about Teresa if Beatriz needs to be taken with us, for in no way could the two of them come. That would prove a burden, although Teresa would bring me some relief, for she prays well. So, I won't say anything. But Beatriz must be careful not to be a burden. And in my opinion, it would not be fitting for you to come with Tomasina.
Your reverence's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus To my illustrious lord and father Canon Vallejo, my lord.
1. ... Because Padre Fray Pedro de la Purificación, who is delivering this, will give you a long report about everything and since I am not well, I will not say any more than beg you again that in one way or another you arrange matters so that they don't fail to bring the documents, for there is no danger of anything being lost. With the proof that there is an income, we can conclude our business. May the Lord bring this about since it is for his glory, and may he preserve you for many years so that you may always support and favor us.
2. It is very important that you let Señora Doña Beatriz know how much she gains before our Lord and how she loses nothing.
Today is 4 February.
3. My letters and those from our padre that are addressed to Señora Doña Beatriz are left open. Read them (you, Mother Prioress, and Subprioress), and then seal them in order to give them to her. And take great care to keep the secret, for you see how important this is to us ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your most illustrious lordship. The archbishop was so delighted with your letter that he immediately began to hurry along this project, without anyone's asking him, so that it will be finished before Easter. And he wants to say the first Mass and bless the church. For this reason we will have to wait, I believe, until the final day of the Easter celebration, since the other days are taken. The necessary formalities required by the provisor are already being taken care of; almost nothing is lacking. They are",2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,1,2,14,0,7,18,0,1,3,9,10,10,14,6,1,3,0,1,0,0,0
"253",1572,8,"all quite new for me. The priests of the first parish were convoked to see if they had any problem with it. They said that on the contrary they would do all they could for us. It can all now be considered as finished, and so I sent thanks to the archbishop. May God be praised, for it seemed to be an impossible struggle to everyone; although not to me, for I always considered the foundation to be as much as made -- and so I am the one who has suffered the least.
2. All the nuns kiss your hands many times because you have freed them from so great a trial. Their joy and the praises they give to God would be a delight for you to behold. May he be ever praised who gave you so much charity that it was enough to bring you to write the letter to the archbishop. Since the devil saw the benefit that was to come from it, he put up more opposition. But it was all to little avail because our most powerful God will do what he wants.
3. I hope the Lord has given you the health necessary to deal with the great amount of work you have had these days, for I have had this intention very much in mind, and all of us have been praying hard for you. Even though a synod means a lot of work, you do very well to have one, for the Lord will give you the energy for everything. It is of great benefit to the Sisters to have you there, but envious ones are not lacking. And I rejoice in the happy Easter you will have.
4. May our Lord give you happy Easters for many years with as much health, which is something necessary for this whole order, amen.
Today is Good Friday.
The last day of the Easter feast, the first Mass will be said, with God's help. And if the archbishop is able, perhaps before.
Your most illustrious lordship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. I was amused by the loud complaining of all of you about our Father Provincial and your neglect to keep him informed after the first letter in which you told him that you had made the foundation. And you all acted in the same way with me.
2. Father Provincial was here on the day of the Cross, and he didn't know anything more than what",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,20,0,7,21,1,1,2,6,8,10,16,13,2,3,2,1,2,1,0
"254",1572,9,"I told him, which came through a letter that the prioress in Seville sent me, in which she said that you bought a house for 12,000 ducats. Where there was so much prosperity, it is not surprising that the patent letters were strictly worded. But down there you're so crafty at not obeying that this latest fact pained me in no small way because of the bad impression it will make in the whole order and also because of the custom that may result by which prioresses will feel independent and will also think up excuses. And since you esteem your hosts so highly, it has been a great indiscretion to stay there with so many nuns. You sent back those poor nuns as soon as they arrived, making them retrace so many leagues -- I don't know how you had the heart to do this. Those who came from Beas could have returned there and others with them. It was terribly impolite to stay in that house with so many -- especially knowing that you were a bother; and inconsiderate to bring so many from Beas knowing that you did not have your own house. Certainly I am amazed at the patience of your hosts. Mistakes were made from the beginning, and since you have no other solution than the one you mention, it will be good for you to try it before you end up with greater scandal, seeing that you hold that it would be scandalous to allow one more sister to enter the community. For so large a city this seems a trifle to me.
3. I laughed to myself over the fear you wished to create in us that the archbishop will suppress the monastery. He no longer has anything to do with it, I don't know why you give him such a large role to play. He would die before succeeding. And if the monastery should continue, as is now the case, by introducing into the order principles that show little obedience, it would be much better if it didn't last. Our worth will not come from having many monasteries but in having nuns in them who are saints.
4. I don't know when these letters that have now come for our padre can be given to him. I fear that he won't be here for another month and a half, and then I don't know where I can be certain in sending them. He went to Soria from here and from there to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,3,7,1,8,12,2,1,0,10,16,9,5,3,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
"255",1572,10,"many places on visitations. Nothing is known for certain where he will be or when we will have news of him. As I figure it, he will be in Villanueva when the poor nuns arrive. It's very painful for me to think of what he will have to go through when they arrive, and the gossip. The place is so small that nothing is secret, and much harm will be done at the sight of such foolishness. They could have been sent to Beas until informing him. They didn't even have a license to return there for he had already officially made them conventuals in Granada, and they were returning right under his eyes. There must have been some way in which the matter could have been remedied, so the fault is all yours for not having mentioned the number of nuns you were bringing from Beas and whether you included any lay Sister. You paid no more heed to our padre than you would have if he hadn't received the office of superior.
5. From what he has told me and considering what he has to do, it will be impossible for him to go there before winter. Please God, Father Vicar Provincial will be able to do it, for they just gave me some letters from Seville, and the prioress writes me that he is struck down by the plague that's afflicting them there -- although it's being kept secret -- and Fray Bartolomé de Jesús also, which saddened me very much. If you haven't learned of this, pray for them; losing them would mean a great loss for the order. On the envelope of the letter someone wrote that Father Vicar is better, although not out of danger. The nuns are very tired and understandably, since they are martyrs in that house and undergo many more trials than you -- although they don't complain as much. Where the nuns are healthy and there is food to eat, being a little crowded won't kill them, especially where they have the support of many sermons. I don't know what the complaining is about, for everything doesn't have to be in perfect shape.
6. Madre Beatriz de Jesús tells Father Provincial that they are waiting for Father Vicar to send the nuns from Beas and Seville back to their houses. The nuns in Seville do not agree with this idea. Besides, Seville is very far and in no way would this be proper. If the need is so great, our",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,2,8,2,13,9,0,2,3,12,2,12,8,5,2,0,0,1,4,0,2
"256",1572,11,"padre will see to the matter. Regarding those from Beas, it would be indeed the right thing to do. If it were not for my fear of contributing to an offense against God through disobedience, I would send you an explicit order, for in all that regards the discalced nuns I stand in the place of our Father Provincial.
7. In virtue of this authority I tell you and order you that as soon as it can be arranged you send back the nuns that came there from Beas with the exception of Mother Prioress, Anne of Jesus. And this should be done even if you have moved into your own house; at least if you have not a good income that will free you from the straits you're now in. For no reason is it good to have so many nuns living together at the beginning of a foundation, whereas this may be appropriate in other situations.
8. I have prayed to our Lord over this matter during these days -- for I didn't want to answer the letters at once -- and I find that by your doing things this way, His Majesty will be served, and the more you suffer from this the more you will serve him. For any kind of attachment, even to the superior, is very foreign to the spirit of discalced nuns, nor would they ever grow spiritually in this way. God wants his brides to be free, attached only to him; and I don't want them to begin acting in this house as they did in Beas. I never forget the letter they wrote me from there when you left office, for a calced nun would not even have written it. This is how cliques begin and many other unfortunate things, although they may not be recognized at the beginning. And for this time, don't follow any opinion but mine, for heaven's sake. For once things are settled and the sisters more detached, they can return if it is fitting.
9. I truly don't know who they are who went, for you kept it really secret from me and from our padre, nor did I think you would take so many nuns from there, but I imagine they are very attached to you. Oh, true spirit of obedience, how when seeing someone in the place of God no repugnance is felt toward loving her! For the sake of God I beg you to take care to inspire souls to be brides of the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,3,18,0,4,13,1,1,1,10,5,13,10,7,2,0,1,0,1,0,0
"257",1572,12,"Crucified, that they crucify themselves by renouncing their own will and the pursuit of childish trifles. Look, this is the beginning in a new kingdom, and you and the other nuns are more obliged to behave as valiant men and not as worthless little women.
10. What is this, madre mía, that you are paying attention to whether Father Provincial calls you presider, or prioress, or Anne of Jesus? It is clear that if you were not in charge, he wouldn't have reason to give you a title above the others, for they have also been prioresses. You have given him so little news of what is taking place that he doesn't know whether elections have been held or not. Certainly, I am ashamed that in so short a time the discalced nuns are paying attention to these trivialities, and after paying attention to them, making them the topic of their conversations, and that Madre María de Cristo makes such an issue out of it. Either through trials you have all become silly or the devil has introduced hellish notions into this order. And after this she praises you as being very courageous as though acting differently would mean you were not. God desires my discalced nuns to be very humble, obedient, and submissive, for all these other kinds of courage mark the beginning of many imperfections without these virtues.
11. Now I recall that in one of your previous letters you wrote that one of the nuns had relatives there who would be helpful if brought with you from Beas. If this is so, I leave it to the prioress to make the decision, but not the others.
12. I truly believe that you will have many sufferings in the beginning. Do not be surprised, for a work as great as this cannot be done without them since, as they say, the recompense will be great. Please God that the imperfections with which I am doing this do not deserve more punishment than reward, for I always have this fear. I am writing to the prioress of Beas to help with the expenses of the journey. You are so short of means there! I assure you that if Avila were closer, I would be very happy to take back my sisters. That could happen with the passing of time and the help of the Lord. So you can say that once the foundation is made and there is no longer a need there, because nuns will be entering from that",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,13,0,8,15,2,2,1,11,9,11,8,7,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"258",1572,13,"area, they may return to the houses from which they came.
13. A little while ago I wrote at length to you and to those madres, and to Padre Fray John, and gave you an account of what has been taking place here, and so it seems that I need to write nothing further than what is in that letter, which was meant for everyone. Please God, things being as they are, you will not be offended as when our padre called you ""presider."" Until we had an election here, when our padre came, this is the term we used, and not ""prioress,"" and it's all the same.
14. Each time I forget to mention this. They told me that in Beas even after the chapter, the nuns were leaving the enclosure to clean the church. I don't know how they can do that since not even the provincial can give permission for this. The prohibition comes from the pope's motu proprio, with severe threats of excommunication, not to speak of the strict prescription of our constitutions. At the beginning this was difficult for us; now we are delighted with it. The Sisters in Avila know well that they cannot even go out to lock the door that opens onto the street. I don't know why you were not informed of this. You should take care of this matter, for goodness' sake. God will provide someone to clean the church and there is a solution to everything ...
15. Every time I think of the crowded conditions in which you have placed your noble hosts, I cannot help but feel bad. I already wrote the other day that you should get a house even if it is not very good or suitable, for you will not be as crowded as you are now, and even if you are it is better that you suffer than to make those who have been so good to you suffer. I am now writing to Señora Doña Ana,b
 and I would like to have words to thank her for the good she has done us. She will not lose anything with our Lord, which is what matters.
16. If you want something from our padre, remember that you have not written to him. For, as I say, it will be late before I can send him letters. I will try. From Villanueva he will be going to Daimiel to receive that monastery, and to Malagón and Toledo; then to Salamanca and Alba, for the elections of",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,8,0,8,11,0,2,3,10,6,8,9,3,0,2,1,0,1,0,0

17. The Sisters could stay there until you have notified the provincial and he decides what the best thing to do might be, for you haven't kept him abreast of anything or written him to tell him the reason you are not taking those nuns.
May God give us light -- for without that, there is little one can be sure of -- and watch over your reverence, amen.
Today is the thirtieth of May.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
18. I am writing to Mother Prioress in Beas about the departure of those nuns and that this should be done with as much secrecy as possible. When it comes to be known, it won't matter. Let Mother Subprioress, her two companions, and Padre Fray John of the Cross read this letter addressed to you, for I don't have the head to be writing more. 1. Jesus. The Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. I tell you I felt very sorry about the illness of that sister. For, apart from the fact that she is very good, I greatly regret the trial it means for you at this time. Always keep me informed about your health, and be careful about getting too close to her. You can truly cater to and care for her and still follow this counsel. I have already written to you of how necessary it is to have charity for the sick. I know you will have it, but I always give this advice to everyone.
2. Concerning what you say about begging for alms, it disturbed me very much, and I don't know why you are asking me what I want you to do, for I told you so many times when I was there that it wasn't appropriate for us to make known our lack of income, how much less to beg. And even the constitutions say, I think, that only in great need may we beg. You are not in great need, for Señora Catalina de Tolosa told me that little by little she will give you the children's share of the estate. If it were known that you had no income, it would be different. Don't",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,1,4,9,0,4,10,2,0,1,12,6,9,8,7,2,2,2,1,3,0,0
"260",1572,15,"say anything, and God deliver you from begging at this time. You won't gain anything, and what on the one hand you do gain, on the other you will lose in many ways. Rather, speak to those lords for me and tell them about this.
3. I have already written, telling you to give them my regards always. I subscribe in advance to all these good wishes that you extend for me, and so it is not a lie.
4. It's terribly hot here, although this morning it was a little cooler, and I was glad for the sick Sister, for it must also be cooler there. Tell the licentiate Aguiar that even though he enters the monastery every day, he must know how painful it is for me not to see him, for he made me very happy with his letter. But I think he will be happy not to find an occasion to make me write again so soon, and the same goes for Doctor Manso, for it is true, and I always send him my regards and ask him to write and let me know how his health is, and the same with Padre Maestro Mata. They greatly envy a confessor like that here.
5. You should know that the cleric in Arévalo was not the one we thought, and it is he himself who said he would go. I spoke with him yesterday, and we were in agreement.
6. Tell the subprioress and Beatriz, and my little roly-poly, that I was delighted with their letters, but they know they must pardon me from answering when there is no particular reason for doing so; tell the same to Pedro's daughter, and give her my regards. Remain with God, my daughter, and may His Majesty preserve you in the holiness I beg from him for you, amen, amen.
It is Vespers of San Lorenzo.
7. Our padre has written me from Almodóvar. He is well, but it is necessary to pray he not go to Andalusia, for he would be willing to do so. He tells me that he would like me to go to Alba and Salamanca before going to Avila, and I have written to Alba and perhaps I will stay there this winter if possible.
Without any doubt your servant,

May the Lord be with your honor always.
Today is Thursday of Easter Week.
Your honor's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. I read in a book that it was an imperfection to have ornate paintings. So I didn't want to keep one I had in my cell. Even before I read this it seemed to me a practice of poverty not to have any other images than paper ones. And since it was after I had formed this opinion that I read the above, I had no longer kept any other kind. And having forgotten about this, I heard the following: that what I wanted to do was not a good mortification (what was better, poverty or charity?); that since love was the better, I shouldn't renounce anything that awakened my love, nor should I take such a thing away from my nuns; that the book was talking about the many carvings and adornments surrounding the picture and not about the picture itself; that what the devil did among the Lutherans was take away all the means for awakening love, and so they went astray. ""My Christians, daughter, must now more than ever do the opposite of what they do.""
I understood that I had a great obligation to serve our Lady and St. Joseph; for often when I went off the path completely, God gave me salvation again through their prayers. 1. One day, after the feast of St. Matthew, being in the state I'm usually in since I've seen the vision of the Blessed Trinity and how it dwells in a soul in the state of grace, a very clear understanding of this mystery was granted to me so that in certain ways and through comparisons I beheld it in an imaginative vision. Although at other times knowledge of the Blessed Trinity was given me through an intellectual vision, the truth, after a few days, no longer remained with me so that I could think about it and find consolation in it, as I can now. And now I realize that in a similar way I had heard about this truth from learned men but didn't understand it as I do at present, although I always believed it without hesitation because I have never had temptations against the faith.
2. To us ignorant people it appears that all three Persons of the Blessed Trinity are -- as represented in paintings -- in one Person, as when three faces are",4,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,5,0,3,14,0,4,21,2,0,0,12,5,6,13,12,4,2,0,1,0,3,0
"262",1572,17,"painted on one body. And thus we are so scared away that it seems the mystery is impossible and that no one should dare think about it. For the intellect feels hindered and fears lest it might have doubts about this truth, and it thereby loses something very beneficial.
3. What was represented to me were three distinct Persons, for we can behold and speak to each one. Afterward I reflected that only the Son took human flesh, through which this truth of the Trinity was seen. These Persons love, communicate with, and know each other. Well, if each one is by Himself, how is it that we say all three are one essence, and believe it? And this is a very great truth for which I would die a thousand deaths. In all three Persons there is no more than one will, one power, and one dominion, in such a way that one cannot do anything without the others. But no matter how many creatures there are, there is only one Creator. Could the Son create an ant without the Father? No, for it is all one power, and the same goes for the Holy Spirit; thus there is only one all-powerful God and all three Persons are one Majesty. Could one love the Father without loving the Son and the Holy Spirit? No, but anyone who pleases one of these three Persons, please all three, and the same goes for anyone who might offend one. Could the Father exist without the Son or without the Holy Spirit? No, because the essence is one; and where one is, all three are, for they cannot be separated. Well, how do we see that the three Persons are separate, and how did the Son take on human flesh and not the Father or the Holy Spirit? This I haven't understood. The theologians know. I know well that in that work so marvelous all three were present, and I don't get involved in thinking a lot about this. I immediately conclude my reflection with the observation that God is all-powerful and that whatever He wanted to do He did, and thus He will be able to do all he desires. And when I understand less, I believe more; and this belief gives me greater devotion. May He be blessed forever. Amen. 1. If our Lord hadn't granted me the favors He did, it doesn't seem to me I would have had the courage for the works that were done or the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,15,2,5,19,3,1,1,16,10,11,17,13,2,2,1,3,0,2,0
"263",1572,18,"strength to support the trials suffered and the statements and judgments made against me. So after the foundations were begun, the fears I previously had in thinking I was deceived left me. I grew certain the work was God's and so I threw myself into difficult tasks, although always with advice and under obedience. As a result I understand that since our Lord desired to revive the original spirit of this order, and in His mercy He took me as a means, His Majesty had to provide me with what I was lacking, which was everything, in order to get results and better manifest His greatness through so wretched a thing. 1. While at the Incarnation in the second year that I was prioress, on the octave of the feast of St. Martin, when I was receiving Communion, Father John of the Cross who was giving me the Blessed Sacrament broke the host to provide for another Sister. I thought there was no lack of hosts but that he wanted to mortify me because I had told him it pleased me very much when the host were large (not that I didn't understand that the size made no difference with regard to the Lord's being wholly present, even when the particle is very small). His Majesty said to me: ""Don't fear, daughter, for no one will be a party to separating you from Me,"" making me thereby understand that what just happened didn't matter. Then He appeared to me in an imaginative vision, as at other times, very interiorly, and He gave me His right hand and said: ""Behold this nail; it is a sign you will be My bride from today on. Until now you have not merited this; from now on not only will you look after My honor as being the honor of your Creator, King, and God, but you will look after it as My true bride. My honor is yours, and yours Mine."" This favor produced such an effect in me I couldn't contain myself, and I remained as though entranced. I asked the Lord either to raise me from my lowliness or not grant me such a favor; for it didn't seem to me my nature could bear it. Throughout the whole day I remained thus very absorbed. Afterward I felt great pain, and greater confusion and affliction at seeing I don't render any service in exchange for such amazing favors. 1.

"265",1573,1,"CHAPTER 2
 
Treats of how she lost these virtues and of how important it is in childhood to associate with virtuous people.
 
1. What I am going to tell about began, it seems to me, to do me much harm. I sometimes reflect on the great damage parents do by not striving that their children might always see virtuous deeds of every kind. For even though my mother, as I said, was so virtuous, I did not, in reaching the age of reason, imitate her good qualities; in fact hardly at all. And the bad ones did me much harm. She loved books of chivalry. But this pastime didn't hurt her the way it did me, for she did not fail to do her duties; and we used to read them together in our free time. Perhaps she did this reading to escape thinking of the great trials she had to bear and to busy her children with something so that they would not turn to other things dangerous to them. Our reading such books was a matter that weighed so much upon my father that we had to be cautioned lest he see us. I began to get the habit of reading these books. And by that little fault, which I saw in my mother, I started to grow cold in my desires and to fail in everything else. I didn't think it was wrong to waste many hours of the day and night in such a useless practice, even though hidden from my father. I was so completely taken up with this reading that I didn't think I could be happy if I didn't have a new book.
2. I began to dress in finery and to desire to please and look pretty, taking great care of my hands and hair and about perfumes and all the empty things in which one can indulge, and which were many, for I was very vain. I had no bad intentions since I would not have wanted anyone to offend God on my account. For many years I took excessive pains about cleanliness and other things that did not seem in any way sinful. Now I see how wrong it must have been.
I had some first cousins who often came to our house, though my father was very cautious and would not allow others to do so; please God he had been inspired to do likewise with my cousins. For now I realize what a danger it is at an",5,1,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,11,9,2,2,2,0,19,17,0,3,7,9,8,9,13,8,5,1,3,2,1,1,1
"266",1573,2,"age when one should begin to cultivate the virtues to associate with people who do not know the vanity of the world but rather are just getting ready to throw themselves into it. They were about my age -- a little older than I -- and we always went about together. They liked me very much, and I engaged in conversation with them about all the things that pleased them. I listened to accounts of their affections and of childish things not the least bit edifying; and, what was worse, I exposed my soul to that which caused all its harm.
3. If I should have to give advice, I would tell parents that when their children are this age they ought to be very careful about whom their children associate with. For here lies the root of great evil since our natural bent is toward the worst rather than toward the best.
So it happened to me. For I had a sister much older than I whose modesty and goodness (of which she had a great deal) I did not imitate at all; and I imitated all that was harmful in a relative who spent a lot of time at our house. She was so frivolous that my mother tried very hard to keep her from coming to our home. It seems my mother foresaw the harm that would be done to me on account of her, but there were so many occasions for her to come to the house that my mother could not prevent it. This relative was the one I liked to associate with. My talks and conversations were with her, for she encouraged me in all the pastimes I desired and even immersed me in them by sharing with me her conversations and vanities. Until I began to associate with her when I was fourteen, or I think older (I mean when she took me for her friend and confidante), I don't think I would have abandoned God by a mortal sin or lost the fear of God, although the fear of losing my honor was stronger in me. This sense of honor gave me the strength not to completely lose my reputation. Nor do I think anything in the world could have made me change my mind in that regard. Neither do I think the love of anyone could have made me give in. Would that I had had the fortitude not to do anything against the honor of God just as my natural",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,3,5,1,15,21,2,2,4,8,6,14,8,7,0,1,1,0,0,1,0
"267",1573,3,"bent gave me fortitude not to lose anything of what I thought belonged to the honor of the world. And I did not see that I was losing it in many other ways.
4. I was extreme in my vain desire for my reputation, but the means necessary to preserve it I didn't take; although I was very circumspect so as not to lose it entirely.
This friendship pained my father and sister. They often reproached me for it. Since they couldn't do away with the occasion for her coming to our home, their careful efforts were useless, for I was strikingly shrewd when it came to mischief. It frightens me sometimes to think of the harm a bad companion can do, and if I hadn't experienced it I wouldn't believe it. Especially during adolescence the harm done must be greater. I should like parents to learn from my experience to be very watchful in this matter. And indeed this conversation so changed me that hardly any virtue remained to my naturally virtuous soul. And I think she and another girl friend of the same type impressed their own traits upon me.
5. From such experience I understand the great profit that comes from good companionship. And I am certain that if at that age I had gone around with virtuous persons, I would have remained whole in virtue. For should I have had when that age someone to teach me to fear God, my soul would have gained strength not to fall. Afterward, having lost this fear of God completely, I only had the fear of losing my reputation, and such fear brought me torment in everything I did. With the thought that my deeds would not be known, I dared to do many things truly against my honor and against God.
6. These things did me harm, I think, at the beginning, and it wasn't her fault but mine. For afterward my malice was sufficient, together with having the maids around, for in them I found a helping hand for every kind of wrong. If there had been one of them to give me good counsel, I perhaps would have benefited by it; but self-interest blinded them as my vanity did me. I was never inclined to great evil -- for I naturally abhorred indecent things -- but to the pastime of pleasant conversation; yet, placed in the occasion, the danger was at hand, and my father's and brothers' reputation was in jeopardy as well. From all these occasions and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,1,5,0,22,22,5,2,6,11,2,13,10,11,3,0,2,2,2,0,0
"268",1573,4,"dangers God delivered me in such a way that it seems clear He strove, against my will, to keep me from being completely lost, although this deliverance could not be achieved so secretly as to prevent me from suffering much loss of reputation and my father from being without suspicion. For it doesn't seem to me that three months during which I engaged in these vanities had gone by when my father brought me to a convent in that place where they educated persons like myself, although not with habits as bad as mine. This was done so cautiously that only I and some relatives knew about it because they waited for an opportunity when it would not seem surprising for me to go to the convent school; that is, once my sister was married it seemed no longer good for me to stay at home without a mother.
7. So excessive was the love my father bore me and so great my dissimulation that he was unable to believe there was much wrong with me, and so he was not angered with me. Since this period of time had been brief, and though he knew something, nothing could be said with certainty. For since I feared so much for my honor, I used every effort to keep my actions secret, and I never considered that one can never do this with Him who sees all things. O my God! What harm is done in the world by considering our actions of only little importance and by thinking something can be done against You in secret! I am certain that great evils would be avoided if we were to understand that the whole matter lies not in our guarding ourselves against men but in our guarding ourselves against displeasing You.
8. The first eight days I felt very unhappy because of my being in the convent school, and more than that because of my suspicion that they knew about my vanity. For already I was wearied and did not fail to have great fear of God when I offended Him, trying to go to confession at once. Although at the beginning I was very unhappy, within eight days -- and I think even less -- I was much more content than when in my father's house. All were very pleased with me, for the Lord gave me the grace to be pleasing wherever I went, and so I was much loved. And although at that time I was strongly against",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,0,8,0,21,18,5,5,6,19,6,5,8,9,1,1,1,0,0,2,0
"269",1573,5,"my becoming a nun, it made me happy to see such good nuns, for there were many good ones in that house, very modest, religious and circumspect. Nonetheless, in spite of all, the devil didn't let up tempting me, through some outsiders who continued to send me messages. But since the opportunities were few, these persons stopped sending them. My soul began to return to the good habits of early childhood, and I saw the great favor God accords to anyone placed with good companions. It seems to me that His Majesty was considering and reconsidering in what way He could bring me back to Himself. May You be blessed, Lord, who put up with me so long! Amen.
9. One thing, it seems, that could have amounted to some excuse for me, should I not have had so many faults, was that the friendship with one of my cousins was in view of a possible marriage; and having inquired of my confessor and other persons about many things, I was told I was doing nothing against God.
10. There was a nun there in care of the dormitory for all of us who were lay persons. It was by means of her it seems that the Lord wished to begin to give me light, as I shall now tell. CHAPTER 27
 
Treats of another way in which the Lord instructs the soul and, without speaking to it, makes His will known in a wonderful manner. Explains also a non-imaginative vision and great favor the Lord granted her. This chapter is very noteworthy.
 
1. Well, to return to the account of my life. I was enduring this difficult affliction, and, as I have said, many prayers were being offered up that the Lord might lead me by another safer path since this one, they told me, was so suspect. The truth of the matter is that even though I was beseeching God and however much I wanted to desire another path, it wasn't in my power to desire it, even though I always prayed for it, because I saw my soul so improved -- except sometimes when I was very worn out from the things they told me and the fears they caused. I saw that I was a completely different person. I could not desire another path, but I placed myself in the hands of God that He would carry out His will completely in me; He knew what suited me. I saw that on this road I was",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,2,1,22,0,5,18,1,1,0,13,7,10,10,6,6,2,1,1,1,0,0
"270",1573,6,"being led to heaven, that previously I had been going to hell, and that I should want to follow this road and not believe that it had the devil as cause. Nor was I able to force myself, even though I did all I could, to believe and desire another road; it wasn't in my power to do so. I offered up what I did, if there was some good deed, for this intention. I invoked my favorite saints that they might free me from the devil. I made novenas. I recommended myself to St. Hilarion and to St. Michael the Archangel, of whom again I became a devotee for this purpose, and I begged many other saints that the Lord might show the truth -- I mean that they might obtain this for me from His Majesty.
2. After two years of all these prayers of mine and those of others offered for the said intention (that the Lord would either lead me by another way or make known the truth, for the locutions I mentioned that the Lord granted me were experienced very repeatedly), the following happened to me. Being in prayer on the feastday of the glorious St. Peter, I saw or, to put it better, I felt Christ beside me; I saw nothing with my bodily eyes or with my soul, but it seemed to me that Christ was at my side -- I saw that it was He, in my opinion, who was speaking to me. Since I was completely unaware that there could be a vision like this one, it greatly frightened me in the beginning; I did nothing but weep. However, by speaking one word alone to assure me, the Lord left me feeling as I usually did: quiet, favored, and without any fear. It seemed to me that Jesus Christ was always present at my side; but since this wasn't an imaginative vision, I didn't see any form. Yet I felt very clearly that He was always present at my right side and that He was the witness of everything I did. At no time in which I was a little recollected, or not greatly distracted, was I able to ignore that He was present at my side.
3. I immediately went very anxiously to my confessor to tell him. He asked me in what form I saw Him. I answered that I didn't see Him. He asked how I knew that it was Christ. I answered that I didn't know how,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,19,0,10,12,4,1,2,18,13,7,15,10,7,4,3,2,0,0,0
"271",1573,7,"but that I couldn't help knowing that He was beside me, that I saw and felt Him clearly, that my recollection of soul was greater, and that I was very continuously in the prayer of quiet, that the effects were much different from those I usually experienced, and that it was very clear.
I could do nothing but draw comparisons in order to explain myself. And, indeed, there is no comparison that fits this kind of vision very well. Since this vision is among the most sublime (as I was afterward told by a very holy and spiritual man, whose name is Friar Peter of Alcántara and of whom I shall speak later, and by other men of great learning) and the kind in which the devil can interfere the least of all, there are no means by which those of us who know little here below can explain it. Learned men will explain it better. For if I say that I see it with the eyes neither of the body nor of the soul, because it is not an imaginative vision, how do I know and affirm that He is more certainly at my side than if I saw Him? It is incorrect to think that the vision is like that experience of those who are blind or in the dark who don't see the other at their side. There is some likeness in this comparison but not a great deal, because in such a case these people experience with their senses; either they hear the other person speak or stir, or they touch them. In the vision there is nothing of this, nor do you see darkness; but the vision is represented through knowledge given to the soul that is clearer than sunlight. I don't mean that you see the sun or brightness, but that a light, without your seeing light, illumines the intellect so that the soul may enjoy such a great good. The vision bears with it wonderful blessings.
4. This vision is not like the presence of God that is often felt, especially by those who experience the prayer of union or quiet, in which it seems that in desiring to begin to practice prayer we find Him to speak to, and it seems we know that He hears us through the effects and spiritual feelings of great love and faith that we tenderly experience, and through other resolutions. This presence is a great favor from God and should be highly esteemed by the one",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,15,0,1,20,0,0,0,25,6,6,14,5,11,8,4,2,2,1,0
"272",1573,8,"He gives it to, for it is a very sublime prayer, but it is not a vision; in this prayer of union or quiet one understands that God is present by the effects that, as I say, He grants to the soul -- that is the way His Majesty wants to give the experience of Himself. In this vision it is seen clearly that Jesus Christ, son of the Virgin, is present. In the prayer of union or quiet some impressions of the Divinity are bestowed; in this vision, along with the impressions, you see that also the most sacred humanity accompanies us and desires to grant us favors.
5. Then the confessor asked me, ""Who said it was Jesus Christ?"" ""He told me many times,"" I answered. But before He told me He impressed upon my intellect that it was He, and before doing this latter He told me He was present -- but I didn't see Him. If a person whom I had never seen but only heard of should come to speak to me while I was blind or in the pitch dark and tell me who he was, I would believe it; but I wouldn't be able to assert as strongly that it was that person as I would if I saw him. In the case of this vision, I would; for, without being seen, it is impressed with such clear knowledge that I don't think it can be doubted. The Lord desires to be so engraved upon the intellect that this vision can no more be doubted than can what is seen; and even less, because when we see we sometimes suspect we may have fancied what we saw. In this vision, even though a suspicion may at first arise, there remains on the other hand such great certitude that the doubt has no force.
6. Hence, there is also another way in which God teaches the soul and speaks to it, different from the manner of speaking described previously. It is a language that belongs so to heaven that here on earth it is poorly understood, no matter how much we may desire to tell about it, if the Lord does not teach us through experience. The Lord puts what He wants the soul to know very deeply within it, and there He makes this known without image or explicit words, but in the manner of this vision we mentioned. And this manner in which God gives the soul understanding of His desires and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,21,0,4,11,4,0,0,13,6,14,16,4,11,8,1,1,1,1,0
"273",1573,9,"great truths and mysteries is worthy of close attention. Often this is the way I understand when His Majesty explains some vision He wishes to represent to me. It seems to me that for the following reasons the devil can interfere least in this experience. If these reasons aren't good ones, I must be wrong.
7. This kind of vision and language is something so spiritual that there is no restlessness in the faculties or in the senses, in my opinion, by which the devil can deduce anything. Sometimes -- briefly -- this suspension takes place; but at other times it seems to me that the faculties are not suspended, nor are the senses withdrawn but very much present. This vision and locution doesn't always come during contemplation; it very seldom does. Yet, when it comes, I say that we neither act nor do anything; all seems to be the work of the Lord. It's as though the food were already placed in the stomach without our eating it or knowing how it got there. It is clearly known to be there, although the stomach doesn't know what food it is or who put it there. But in the case of these locutions, the intellect does know, yet it doesn't know how the locution got there; nothing is seen or understood, nor was the soul ever moved to desire it -- nor had I ever been informed that this was possible.
8. In the locution we spoke of previously, God makes the intellect become aware -- even though it may not wish to do so -- and understand what is said; in that experience the soul seemingly has other ears with which it hears, and God makes it listen, and it is not distracted. It's like this: if people have good hearing and don't block their ears and are spoken to in a loud voice, they hear, even though they may not want to; and, in fact, they do something, since they are attentive in order to understand what is spoken to them.
In the locution we are now speaking of, there is none of the above; even this little thing of only listening, which the soul did in the previous locution, is taken away. It finds everything prepared and eaten. There is nothing more to do than to enjoy, as in the example of someone who without having learned or done any work to know how to read, and without having studied anything, would find that all knowledge was possessed",2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,9,0,5,8,2,0,0,30,9,8,26,10,1,15,0,4,0,0,4
"274",1573,10,"inwardly, without knowing how or where it was gotten since no studying had been done, nor even had the abc's been learned.
9. This last comparison seems to me to explain something about this heavenly gift, for the soul sees that in an instant it is wise; the mystery of the Blessed Trinity and other sublime things are so explained that there is no theologian with whom it would not dispute in favor of the truth of these grandeurs. It is left full of amazement; one of these favors is enough to change a soul completely, free it from the love of things, and make it love Him who it sees makes it capable, without any effort of its own, of blessings so great, who communicates secrets to it and treats it with such friendship and love that one cannot describe this in writing. He grants some favors that would be suspect, since they are so admirable and granted to someone who has so little merited them. Those who don't have a very living faith will be unable to believe in them. So I am thinking of speaking but little of the favors the Lord granted me -- unless I'm ordered to do otherwise -- except for certain visions that can do some good for others; or so that the one to whom the Lord may grant them doesn't become frightened, as I did, in thinking the experience is impossible; or that I might explain the manner and path by which the Lord led me, which is what they commanded me to write about.
10. Returning then to the discussion of this kind of understanding, it seems to me that the Lord in every way wants this soul to have some knowledge of what goes on in heaven. I think that just as in heaven you understand without speaking (which I certainly never knew until the Lord in His goodness desired that I should see and showed Himself to me in a rapture), so it is in this vision. For God and the soul understand each other only through the desire His Majesty has that it understand Him, without the use of any other means devised to manifest the love these two friends have for each other. It's like the experience of two persons here on earth who love each other deeply and understand each other well; even without signs, just by a glance, it seems, they understand each other. This must be similar to what happens in the vision;",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,17,0,1,31,1,0,0,24,8,8,16,7,4,2,0,0,1,5,0
"275",1573,11,"without our knowing how, these two lovers gaze directly at each other, as the Bridegroom says to the Bride in the Song of Songs -- I think I heard that it is there.
11. O admirable kindness of God, You allow me to gaze upon You with eyes that have so badly gazed as have those of my soul. May they, Lord, become accustomed through this vision not to look at base things, so that nothing outside of You might satisfy them! O ingratitude of mortals! To what extremes will you go? For I know through experience that what I say is true and that what can be said is the least of what You do, Lord, for a soul You bring to such frontiers. O souls that have begun to practice prayer and have true faith, what good things can you still seek in this life -- leaving aside what is gained for eternity -- that could compare with the least of these favors?
12. Reflect that it is indeed certain that God gives Himself in this way to those who give up all for Him. He shows no partiality, He loves everyone. Nobody has any excuse, no matter how miserable they may be, since the Lord so acts with me in bringing me to such a state. Note that what I say is not even a compendium of what could be said. I only say what is necessary to explain this kind of vision and favor the Lord grants the soul. But I can't describe what is felt when the Lord gives it an understanding of His secrets and grandeurs, the delight that so surpasses all those knowable here on earth; indeed, it rightly makes you abhor the delights of this life, which together are all rubbish. I would find it revolting to have to try to make a comparison between the two delights, even if those of earth were to last forever and those given by the Lord were only a drop of water from the vast overflowing river that is prepared for us.
13. It is a shame, and I certainly am ashamed of myself; if one were able to be embarrassed in heaven, I would be more embarrassed there than anyone! Why must we want so many blessings and delights and so much endless glory all at the cost of the good Jesus? Shall we not at least weep with the daughters of Jerusalem since we do not, with the Cyrenian, help Him carry His cross?",2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,1,17,1,6,22,5,0,2,11,8,8,7,14,5,9,1,1,2,2,1
"276",1573,12,"How can we enjoy along with pleasures and pastimes what He won for us at the cost of so much blood? It's impossible! And do we think that with vain honors we can imitate Him in the contempt He suffered so that we might reign forever? Such a road leads nowhere; it's the wrong, wrong road; we will never arrive by it.
Your Reverence ought to cry out these truths since God has taken from me freedom to do so. I should like them to be proclaimed to me always; yet I've been so slow myself to hear and understand God, as will be seen in what is written here, that it is very embarrassing to speak about this; as a result I desire to be silent. I shall only say what sometimes comes to mind. May it please the Lord to bring me to the goal that I might enjoy this blessing.
14. What accidental glory and what happiness will be the lot of the blessed when they see that, even though late, nothing possible remained for them to do for God and that in conformity with their strength and state they left nothing undone for Him, and in having more, gave more! How rich they will find that they are, they who have left all riches for Christ! How honored will they be, they who have not sought honor from Him but have enjoyed seeing themselves humbled! How wise will they be, they who rejoiced to be considered mad because that is what Wisdom Himself was called! How few madmen there are now -- on account of our sins! Truly it seems that now there are no more of those whom people considered mad for doing the heroic deeds of true lovers of Christ. O world, world, how you go on gaining in honor by having few who know you!
15. But do we think that God is now served more if we are considered wise and discreet! That really must be the reason so much discretion is used. We are quick to believe that not much edification is given if each one doesn't proceed, according to one's state, with composure and authority. Even a friar, cleric, or nun would think that to wear something old and patched would be a kind of novelty and would give scandal to the weak; and that even recollection and the practice of prayer would do this. The world has such a mentality and has so forgotten the great perfection and lofty impulses",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,4,12,0,11,29,1,3,2,13,12,11,11,9,3,4,0,2,1,1,0
"277",1573,13,"of love the saints experienced that I think this mentality causes more harm and misfortune in these troubled times we live in than the scandals caused by religious when they back up with deeds what they say with words about how little the world should be esteemed; from such scandals the Lord draws forth great blessings. If some are scandalized, others come to their senses. At least there would be offered an image of what Christ and His Apostles suffered since now more than ever such an image is needed.
16. And what a good image of Christ God took from us now in the blessed Friar Peter of Alcántara! The world cannot at this time endure so much perfection. They say that our health is weaker and that these times are not like those of the past. Yet this holy man belonged to the present age. His spirit is large, as in times past; so he trampled the world under foot. Although others may not be detached or perform such harsh penance as he, there are many ways, as I've said at other times, of trampling on the world; the Lord teaches them when He sees the courage. And what marvelous courage His Majesty gave this great saint of whom I'm speaking in order that he perform such rough penance, as everyone knows, for forty-seven years! I want to say something about this penance, for I know the facts are all true.
17. He told me of it, and also another person from whom he hid nothing. (The reason he told me was his love for me, for the Lord desired this so that he would return and encourage me at a time of great need, as I said and will say.) I think he told me that for forty years he slept only an hour and a half during the night and that in the beginning this was his greatest penitential trial, to conquer sleep, and that to do this he was always either on his knees or standing. When he did sleep, he did so sitting up, with his head resting on a little log nailed to the wall. He could not have stretched out even if he wanted to, because his cell -- as is known -- was no larger than four and a half feet. However hot or rainy the weather was in all those years, he never put up his cowl; he wore nothing on his feet, nor did he wear any clothes other",3,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,16,0,4,14,0,0,1,7,6,11,9,8,4,7,2,10,2,2,0
"278",1573,14,"than a coarse serge habit with nothing else to cover the body -- that was as tight as could be, and a short mantle over it made of the same material. He told me that when it was terribly cold he took the mantle off and left the door and little window of his cell opened so that afterward by putting the mantle on again and closing the door he was able to appease the body by the warmth that came from more covering. Eating every third day was a very common practice for him, and he told me when I showed surprise that it was easily possible for anyone who got used to doing so. One of his companions told me that once Friar Peter went eight days without eating. It must have happened while he was in prayer, for he experienced great raptures and impulses of love of God, of which I was once a witness.
18. His practice of poverty and mortification during his youth was extreme. He told me that he had lived in a house of his order for three years and, because he had never raised his eyes, had not known any of the friars save by their voice, and that he hadn't known how to get to the places where he had go, but followed the other friars. This he did on his journeys. He never looked at women for many years. He told me that it no longer made any difference whether he saw or did not see. But he was very old when I came to know him, and so extremely weak that it seemed he was made of nothing but tree roots.
Yet with all this sanctity he was very affable, although his words were few unless he was questioned. He was very pleasant in his speech because he had a bright mind. There are many other things I should like to say, but I am afraid your Reverence will ask why I'm getting into all this -- and I've written it with this fear. Hence, I will conclude by saying that his ending was like his life, preaching to his friars and admonishing them. When he saw that he was dying, he recited the psalm, Laetatus sum in his quae dicta sunt mihi, and casting himself on his knees, he died.
19. Afterward the Lord was pleased that I receive more help from him -- through the counsel he gave me about many matters -- than I did during his",4,3,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,1,5,2,4,11,2,0,0,6,11,3,7,7,6,4,3,4,2,1,2
"279",1573,15,"life. I have often seen him in the greatest glory. He told me the first time he appeared to me that the penance that merited such a reward was a blessed penance, and many other things. One year before he died, though being some leagues away from here, he appeared to me; since I knew he was going to die, I told him so. When he died, he appeared to me and told me that he was going to his rest. I didn't believe it, but did tell some persons; after eight days the news came that he was dead, or, better, that he had begun to live forever.
20. Behold how this harsh life ended with such great glory. I think he consoles me much more than when he was here on earth. The Lord once told me that nothing would be sought in Friar Peter's name that He would not bestow. Many of the things I've recommended to his prayers I've seen fulfilled. May the Lord be blessed forever, amen.
21. But what a discourse I've got into! May it awaken your Reverence so that you will not esteem anything pertaining to this life -- as though you didn't know and weren't already determined to abandon all, and hadn't already put this renunciation into practice!
I see so much perdition in the world that even though my writing about it brings me no more benefit than to tire me out, I find rest in doing so; for everything I have written is against myself. May the Lord pardon me for my offenses against Him in this matter, and may your Reverence do so too, for I tire you unintentionally. It appears that I want you to do penance for my sins in this matter.

CHAPTER 28
 
Deals with the great favors the Lord granted her and how He appeared to her the first time. Explains what an imaginative vision is. Tells about the remarkable effects and signs this vision leaves behind when it is from God. This is a very instructive chapter and well worth nothing.
 
1. To return to our topic, I passed some days -- a few -- in which I experienced this vision continually; it did me so much good that I never left prayer. No matter how much I did, I strove that it be done in such a way that it would not displease the One who I clearly saw was witnessing it. And although sometimes I was afraid on account of all the warnings",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,14,4,4,14,1,1,1,9,5,4,16,7,4,0,0,0,5,0,0
"280",1573,16,"they were giving, this fear didn't last long, because the Lord was giving me assurance.
One day, while I was in prayer, the Lord desired to show me only His hands which were so very beautiful that I would be unable to exaggerate the beauty. This vision caused me great fear; any supernatural favor the Lord grants me frightens me at first, when it is new. After a few days I saw also that divine face which it seems left me completely absorbed. Since afterward He granted me the favor of seeing Him entirely, I couldn't understand why the Lord showed Himself to me in this way, little by little, until later I understood that His Majesty was leading me in accordance with my natural weakness. May He be blessed forever! So much glory would have been unbearable next to so lowly and wretched a subject as I; and as one who knew this, the merciful Lord was preparing me.
2. It will seem to your Reverence that strength like this wasn't necessary to see some hands and so beautiful a face. Glorified bodies have such beauty that the sight of so supernatural a beauty deriving from glory causes confusion. Thus the vision caused me a fear so great that I was completely agitated and disturbed, although afterward I remained so certain and secure and felt such other effects that I immediately lost the fear.
3. One feastday of St. Paul, while I was at Mass, this most sacred humanity in its risen form was represented to me completely, as it is in paintings, with such wonderful beauty and majesty; I have written about it in particular to your Reverence when you insistently ordered me to do so. And writing about it was very difficult for me to do because one cannot describe this vision without ruining it. But as best I could I have already told you about it, and so there is no reason to speak of it here again. I only say that if there were nothing else to provide delight for one's vision in heaven than the exalted beauty of glorified bodies, this vision would be very great glory, especially the vision of the humanity of Jesus Christ, our Lord. And if even here on earth His Majesty shows Himself according to what our wretchedness can bear, what will be the glory when such a blessing is enjoyed completely?
4. I never saw this vision -- nor any other -- with my bodily eyes, even though it is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,15,0,13,33,7,1,3,8,11,8,10,10,13,2,3,8,1,0,0
"281",1573,17,"an imaginative one.
Those who know more about these matters than I say that the intellectual vision is more perfect than this one and that this one is much more perfect than visions seen with the bodily eyes. These latter, corporeal visions, they say, are the lowest and the kind in which the devil can cause more illusions; although at that time I couldn't understand this. But since an imaginative vision was being granted to me, I desired that I might see it with my bodily eyes so that my confessor wouldn't tell me that I had imagined it. And after the vision passed away, it also happened to me -- and this was at once -- that I thought that I had imagined it; thinking I had deceived my confessor, I was bothered about having told it to him. This was another cause for tears, and I went and explained to him. He asked me whether it just seemed to me that I had deceived him or whether I had desired to deceive him. I told him the truth, for, in my opinion, I had not lied, nor had I intended to; nor for anything in the world would I say one thing for another. He well knew this, and so he tried to calm me. I felt so sorry for having gone to him with these things, for I don't know how the devil got me to torment myself with the thought that I had made up the vision.
But so quickly did the Lord grant me this favor and declare this truth that very soon the doubt about my imagining it left me, and afterward I saw clearly my foolishness. If I should have spent many years trying to imagine how to depict something so beautiful, I couldn't have, nor would I have known how to; it surpasses everything imaginable here on earth, even in just its whiteness and splendor.
5. The splendor is not one that dazzles; it has a soft whiteness, is infused, gives the most intense delight to the sight, and doesn't tire it; neither does the brilliance, in which is seen the vision of so divine a beauty, tire it. It is a light so different from earthly light that the sun's brightness that we see appears very tarnished in comparison with that brightness and light represented to the sight, and so different that afterward you wouldn't want to open your eyes. It's like the difference between a sparkling, clear water that flows over",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,9,18,1,2,2,20,8,11,10,7,16,3,2,5,2,0,1
"282",1573,18,"crystal and on which the sun is reflecting and a very cloudy, muddy water flowing along the ground. This doesn't mean that the sun is represented or that the light resembles sunlight. It seems in fact like natural light, and the sunlight seems artificial. It is a light that has no night; nothing troubles it. In sum, it is of such a kind that a person couldn't imagine what it is like in all of life's days no matter how powerful the intellect. God gives it so suddenly that there wouldn't even be time to open your eyes, if it were necessary to open them. For when the Lord desires to give the vision, it makes no more difference if they are opened than if they are closed; even if we do not desire to see the vision, it is seen. No distraction is enough to resist it, nor is there power or diligence or care enough to do so. I have clearly experienced this, as I shall say.
6. What I should now like to speak of is the way in which the Lord reveals Himself by means of these visions. I don't mean that I shall explain how such a strong light can be put in the interior faculty and so clear an image put in the intellect -- for it seems truly that that's where it is -- because this is something for men of learning to explain. The Lord has not given me understanding of how this is done, and I am so ignorant and my intellect so dull that to no matter what extent these men of learning have desired to explain to me how this vision comes about, I have still not been able to understand. It is certain that even though it seems to your Reverence that I have a lively intellect, I do not. In many things I've experienced that I don't know any more than what is given me to eat, as the saying goes. Sometimes my confessors have been amazed at my ignorance. And I have never understood, nor have I desired to understand, how God causes this vision or how it could come about, nor did I ask, even though, as I have said, for many years now I've had contact with competent men of learning. Whether something was a sin or not -- yes, this I did discuss with them. As for the rest, it wasn't necessary for me to think anything but that God did it",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,8,0,6,13,1,0,1,23,9,12,18,9,6,4,0,1,0,0,2
"283",1573,19,"all. I saw there was no reason for me to be startled but to praise Him. Indeed the difficult things He does cause more devotion in me; and the more difficult, the more devotion they cause.
7. I shall then say what I have come to see through experience. How the Lord does it, your Reverence will speak of better than I, and will explain what remains obscure and what I may not have known how to say. It seemed clear to me in some cases that what I saw was an image, but in many other instances, no; rather, it was Christ Himself by reason of the clarity with which He was pleased to reveal Himself to me. Sometimes the vision was so obscure that it seemed to me an image, not like an earthly drawing no matter how perfect it may be -- for I have seen many good ones. It is foolish to think that an earthly drawing can look anything like a vision; it does so no more nor less than living persons resemble their portraits. No matter how good the portrait may have turned out, it can't look so natural that in the end it isn't recognized as a dead thing. But let us leave this example aside; it applies well here and is very exact.
8. I don't say this example is a comparison -- for comparisons are never so exact -- but the truth. The difference lies in that which there is between living persons and paintings of them -- no more nor less. For if what is seen is an image, it is a living image -- not a dead man, but the living Christ. And He makes it known that He is both man and God, not as He was in the tomb but as He was when He came out of the tomb after His resurrection. Sometimes He comes with such great majesty that no one could doubt but that it is the Lord Himself. Especially after receiving Communion -- for we know that He is present, since our faith tells us this -- He reveals Himself as so much the lord of this dwelling that it seems the soul is completely dissolved; and it sees itself consumed in Christ. O my Jesus! Who could make known the majesty with which You reveal Yourself! And, Lord of all the world and of the heavens, of a thousand other worlds and of numberless worlds, and of the heavens that You might",2,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,14,4,8,16,3,1,0,15,11,4,15,10,12,4,0,0,5,0,0
"284",1573,20,"create, how the soul understands by the majesty with which You reveal Yourself that it is nothing for You to be Lord of the world!
9. In this vision the powerlessness of all the devils in comparison with Your power is clearly seen, my Jesus; and it is seen how whoever is pleasing to You can trample all hell under foot. In this vision the reason is seen why the devils feared when You descended into limbo and why they would have preferred to be in another thousand lower hells in order to flee from such great majesty. I see that You want the soul to know how tremendous this majesty is and the power that this most sacred humanity joined with the Divinity has. In this vision there is a clear representation of what it will be like on Judgment Day to see the majesty of this King and to see its severity toward those who are evil. This vision is the source of the true humility left in the soul when it sees its misery, which it cannot ignore. This vision is the source of confusion and true repentance for sins; although the soul sees that He shows love, it doesn't know where to hide, and so it is completely consumed.
I say that this vision has such tremendous power when the Lord desires to show the soul a great part of His grandeur and majesty that it would be impossible for any subject to endure it -- unless the Lord should want to help it very supernaturally by placing it in rapture and ecstasy since in the enjoyment of that divine presence the vision of it is lost.
Is it true that it is forgotten afterward? That majesty and beauty remain so impressed that they are unforgettable, except when the Lord wishes the soul to suffer a great dryness and solitude of which I shall speak further on; for then it seems it even forgets God. The soul undergoes a change; it is always absorbed; it seems that a new, living, high degree of love is beginning. For although the intellectual vision, of which I spoke, that represents God in an imageless way is more perfect, a wonderful thing happens when so divine a presence is represented in the imagination so that in conformity with our weakness this presence can last in the memory and keep the thought well occupied. These two kinds of vision almost always come together. This is the way they occur: with the eyes",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,23,0,13,23,3,2,4,11,11,9,6,11,11,3,1,2,2,2,0
"285",1573,21,"of the soul we see the excellence, beauty, and glory of the most holy humanity; and through the intellectual vision, which was mentioned, we are given an understanding of how God is powerful, that He can do all things, that He commands all and governs all, and that His love permeates all things.
10. This vision is very worthy of esteem and, in my opinion, there is no danger in it, because by its effects it is known that the devil has no power here. It seems to me he has wanted to represent the Lord Himself in this way three or four times by a false representation. He takes the form of flesh, but he can't counterfeit the image by giving it the glory that it has when it comes from God. He makes representations so as to destroy the true vision the soul has seen; but the soul of itself resists and is agitated, displeased, and disturbed since it loses the devotion and delight it had before and remains without prayer. In the beginning this happened, as I said, three or four times. It is something so very different that even if one has experienced only the prayer of quiet, I believe that one will understand by the effects which were mentioned in speaking of locutions. This false representation is something very obvious; if the soul does not want to be deceived, and it walks in humility and simplicity, I don't think it will be deceived. Anyone who has had a true vision from God can tell the false almost immediately, for, although this false vision begins with pleasure and delight, the soul hurls it from itself; and even the delight, I think, must be different -- it doesn't have the appearance of pure and chaste love. The devil very quickly shows who he is. So where there is experience, the devil, in my opinion, can do no harm.
11. That this vision from God could be the work of the imagination is the most impossible of impossible things; it is utter nonsense to think so, for the beauty and the whiteness of one hand alone is completely beyond our imagination. It's impossible to see in a moment, without thinking or ever having thought about them, things represented that in a long time could not have been put together by the imagination, because they go far beyond, as I said, what we can comprehend here on earth. And if we could imagine something of the vision, the difference",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,16,0,10,16,1,3,2,17,7,12,16,11,7,4,1,2,0,2,0
"286",1573,22,"could still be seen clearly by this other factor that I shall now mention. For if the vision were represented by means of the intellect, apart from the fact that it wouldn't produce any of the great effects that a true one produces, the soul would be left exhausted. Doing this would be like wanting to make oneself go to sleep and yet remaining awake because the sleep doesn't come. When people need sleep or feel a weakness in the head and desire sleep, they do what they can and at times it seems they are achieving something. But if it isn't true sleep that comes to them, they will not be sustained nor will they experience in their head a renewed feeling of strength; rather, they will feel more exhausted. Something similar would happen here; for if the intellect were to produce the vision, the soul would be left exhausted -- not sustained and strong, but tired and displeased. One cannot exaggerate the richness that the true vision leaves; it even gives health to the body and leaves it comforted.
12. I gave this reason along with others when they told me that the devil was the cause or that I had fancied the vision -- and this was often -- and I made comparisons as I could, and the Lord gave me understanding. But all of this proved to be of little avail. Since there were very holy persons in this place -- and compared to them I was a wretched person -- and God was not leading them by this path, they immediately became fearful. For it seems that because of my sins, my secrets and confidences, which they came to know of, were spread around, although I spoke to no one about them except to my confessor or anyone he told me to tell.
13. I told them once that if they were to tell me that a person whom I knew very well and with whom I had just finished speaking were not that person, but that I had imagined it, I would without doubt, as they knew, believe what they said rather than what I had seen. But if this person were to leave me some jewels, and they were left in my hands as tokens of great love, I would not believe what they said, even though I desired, because I hadn't had any jewels before and was poor, whereas now I found that I was rich. I was able to show them",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,3,8,0,8,15,2,0,0,20,13,20,18,7,2,4,4,9,6,1,0
"287",1573,23,"these jewels because all who knew me saw clearly that my soul was changed, and my confessor told me so. The difference in all things was very great; it was not feigned, but all could see it very clearly. I said that since I was previously so wretched I couldn't believe that if the devil did this to deceive me and bring me to hell he would have taken a means as contrary as was that of removing vices and bestowing virtues and fortitude. For I saw clearly that by these experiences I was at once changed.
14. Insofar as I know, my confessor, as I say -- who was a truly holy Father from the Society of Jesus -- gave this same reply. He was very discreet and deeply humble; and this humility that was so great brought upon me many trials. For since he was a learned and very prayerful man, and the Lord didn't lead him by this path, he didn't trust in himself. He suffered many great trials in many ways on my account. I knew that they told him to be careful of me, that he shouldn't let the devil deceive him by anything I told him; they brought up examples to him of other persons. All of this made me anxious. I feared that I would have no one who would hear my confession, but that all would run from me. I did nothing but weep.
15. By God's providence he wanted to continue to hear my confession, for he was such a great servant of God that he would have put up with anything for God; so he advised me that I shouldn't turn aside from what he told me or fear that he would fail me, and that I shouldn't offend God. He always encouraged and comforted me. He always ordered me not to hold anything from him. I never did. He told me that if I followed this advice the devil wouldn't be able to harm me even if the vision did come from him, but that rather the Lord would draw good out of the evil the devil desired to do my soul. This Father strove for my soul's perfection in every way he could. Since I had so much fear, I obeyed him in everything, although imperfectly; for on account of these trials he suffered a great deal during the three years or more that he was my confessor. In the great persecutions I suffered and in the many",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,21,0,17,14,4,3,5,11,9,20,8,15,3,4,0,0,0,0,0
"288",1573,24,"bad judgments the Lord allowed others to make of me -- and often without their being at fault -- everyone came to him, and he was blamed without any fault on his part.
16. It would have been impossible for him to suffer so much if he hadn't been so holy and the Lord hadn't encouraged him. He had to respond to those who thought I was going astray; and they didn't believe him. On the other hand he had to calm me and heal the fear I had by putting greater stress on the fear of offending God. He also had to assure me; for since in each vision there was something new, God permitted that I afterward be left with great fears. Everything happened to me because I was and had been such a sinner. This Father comforted me with great pity. If he would have trusted in himself more, I wouldn't have suffered so much; God gave him understanding of the truth in all things -- the very Sacrament itself enlightened him, I believe.
17. Those servants of God who were not so sure about me conversed with me often. Since I spoke carelessly about some things, they interpreted my intention differently and thought that what I said, without my being careful, as I say, showed little humility. (I loved one of them very much because my soul owed him an infinite debt and he was very holy; I felt it infinitely when I saw that he didn't understand me; he strongly desired that I might advance and that the Lord might give me light). Upon seeing some little fault in me -- for they saw many -- everything else was immediately condemned. They asked me some things; I answered plainly and carelessly. At once they supposed that I wanted to teach them and that I thought I was wise. It would all get back to my confessor, for certainly they desired my good; and he would again scold me.
18. This lasted for a long time, in which I was afflicted on all sides, although I was able to bear those trials by means of the favors the Lord was granting me. I say this so that it might be known what a great trial it is not to have someone who has experience of this spiritual path; if the Lord hadn't favored me so much, I don't know what would have happened to me. There were enough things to drive me insane, and sometimes I found",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,15,0,15,18,4,2,3,16,8,13,16,9,3,4,2,1,1,1,0
"289",1573,25,"myself in such straits that I didn't know what to do other than raise my eyes to the Lord. For the opposition of good men to a little woman, wretched, weak, and fearful like myself, seems to be nothing when described in so few words; yet among the very severe trials I suffered in my life, this was one of the most severe. Please the Lord that I may have served His Majesty somewhat through this trial. For I am very certain that those who accused and condemned me were serving Him, and that it was all for my greater good.

CHAPTER 29
 
Continues the topic begun and tells of some great favors the Lord granted her and of some things His Majesty told her for her own assurance and so that she could answer those who contradicted her.
 
1. I've wandered far from my topic because I was about to speak of the signs for discerning that the vision is not produced by the imagination. How could we represent in detail the humanity of Christ and imagine His great beauty? No little time would be required if the image were to look somewhat like Him. You could indeed represent Him in your imagination and gaze upon Him for some time, and upon His form and whiteness, and gradually perfect that image and commit it to memory. Who could take away such a image, since the intellect was able to fashion it? In the vision we are dealing with there is no possibility of fashioning it ourselves, but we must look at what the Lord desires to show us, when He desires, and as He desires. There is no taking it away or inducing it, nor, however much we try, is there any way of doing either; nor when we desire is there a way to see it or to stop seeing it. If we want to look at some particular thing, the vision of Christ ceases.
2. For two and a half years God frequently granted me this favor. It must be for over three years now that He has continually replaced this favor with another more sublime -- as I shall perhaps afterward explain. And in being aware that He was speaking to me and that I was beholding that great beauty and the gentleness with which He spoke those words with His most beautiful and divine mouth -- and at other times beholding His severity -- and strongly desiring to know the color of His eyes, or",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,8,0,6,20,1,1,1,12,5,15,18,8,16,3,0,3,2,0,0
"290",1573,26,"how tall he was, so that I could be able to describe these things, I never merited to see them. Nor was I able to obtain this knowledge; rather, by trying to do so, I would lose the vision entirely. Indeed I sometimes see Him looking at me with pity, but this kind of vision is so powerful that the soul cannot suffer it, and it remains in such a sublime rapture that in order to enjoy the beautiful vision more completely it loses it. Hence with respect to this vision there is nothing to desire or not to desire. It is clearly seen that the Lord desires nothing else than humility and confusion, and that we accept what is given and praise the one who gives it.
3. This is the case in all visions without exception; our effort can neither do nor undo anything when it comes to seeing more or seeing less. So that we may be made less capable of pride, the Lord desires us to be very clearly aware that this is not our work but His Majesty's work. Rather, it makes us humble and fearful when we observe that since the Lord takes away our power of seeing what we desire to see, He can take from us these favors and gifts -- and we shall be left with nothing. We should always walk in fear as long as we live in this exile.
4. The Lord almost always showed Himself to me as risen, also when He appeared in the Host -- except at times when He showed me His wounds in order to encourage me when I was suffering tribulation. Sometimes He appeared on the cross or in the garden, and a few times with the crown of thorns; sometimes He also appeared carrying the cross on account, as I say, of my needs and those of others. But His body was always glorified.
I suffered numerous affronts and trials in speaking about these visions, and very many persecutions. It seemed so certain to them that I had a devil that some persons wanted to exorcise me. This didn't matter much to me; but I grieved when I saw that my confessors were afraid to hear my confession or when I learned that others said something to them. Nonetheless, I was never able to regret having seen these heavenly visions, and I would not exchange even one for all the goods and delights of the world. I have always considered a vision a",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,2,10,1,13,13,4,0,8,8,5,15,17,14,11,4,0,1,1,0,0
"291",1573,27,"great favor from the Lord. It seems to me to be a most rich treasure, and the Lord Himself assured me of this many times. I saw that I was increasing very much in His love. I went to Him to complain about all these trials, and I always came away from prayer consoled and with new strength. I didn't dare contradict those who were judging my spirit, because I saw that everything would then become worse since my doing so would appear to them as a lack of humility. I talked with my confessor; he always consoled me greatly when he saw that I was troubled.
5. Since the visions were increasing, one from the group who previously helped me -- for he sometimes heard my confession when the ordinary confessor wasn't able to do so -- began to say that it was clearly the devil. He ordered that, since I didn't have the means to resist the visions, I should always bless myself when I saw one and make the gesture of scorn called the fig; he was certain the devil was the cause and that by my doing this the vision wouldn't return. He told me that I shouldn't be afraid, that God would protect me and take it away from me. Following this advice was very painful for me. Since I couldn't believe but that the vision was from God, it was a terrible thing for me to have to do what I was commanded; and neither could I desire, as I said, that the vision be taken away. But, finally, I did all they ordered me to do. I begged God persistently and with many tears that He would free me from deception. And I begged St. Peter and St. Paul; for since the first time the Lord appeared to me was on their feastday, He told me that they would protect me from being deceived. Thus I often saw them very clearly at my left, although not by an imaginative vision. These glorious saints were very much lords of mine.
6. Making the fig at this vision of the Lord caused me the greatest pain. When I saw Him present, I couldn't have believed it was the devil if they broke me in pieces; thus it was a kind of severe penance for me. So that I would not be forever blessing myself, I held a cross in my hand. I did this almost all the time; I didn't make the fig so continually,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,20,0,14,12,1,1,2,9,13,15,8,12,6,3,1,1,2,1,0
"292",1573,28,"because it grieved me deeply to do so. I recalled the injuries the Jews caused Him and begged Him to pardon me since I was doing it in order to obey the one who stood in His place, and not to blame me, since they were the ministers that He had placed in His Church. He told me not to worry and that I did well in obeying, but that He would make the truth known. When they forbade me to practice prayer, it seemed to me He was annoyed. He told me to tell them that now what they were doing was tyranny. He gave me signs for knowing that the vision was not from the devil. I shall mention some afterward.
7. Once while I was holding the cross in my hand, for I had it on a rosary, He took it from me with His own hands; when He gave it back to me, it was made of four large stones incomparably more precious than diamonds -- there is no appropriate comparison for supernatural things. A diamond seems to be something counterfeit and imperfect when compared with the precious stones that are seen there. The representation of the five wounds was of very delicate workmanship. He told me that from then on I would see the cross in that way; and so it happened, for I didn't see the wood from which it was made but these stones. No one, however, saw this except me.
When I began to try to obey the command to reject and resist these favors, there was a much greater increase in them. In seeking to distract myself, I never got free from prayer. It even seemed to me that I was in prayer while sleeping. There was an increase of love and of the loving complaints I was addressing to the Lord; the pain became unbearable, nor was it in my power to stop thinking of Him no matter how much I tried and even though I wanted to. Nonetheless, I obeyed when I could; but in this matter I was able to do little or nothing at all, and the Lord never took prayer from me. But even though He told me to do what they said, He assured me on the other hand and taught me what I should say to them -- and so He does now. He gave me so many adequate reasons that these reasons made me feel completely secure.
8. After a short time His Majesty",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,1,11,1,9,11,2,2,2,11,15,5,6,6,4,2,4,4,3,1,0
"293",1573,29,"began as He had promised me to give further indication that it was He by increasing the love of God in me to such a degree that I didn't know where it came from (for it was very supernatural); nor did I procure it. I saw that I was dying with desire to see God, and I didn't know where to seek this life except in death. Some great impulses of this love came upon me in such a way that, even though they were not as unbearable as those I already mentioned before or of such value, I didn't know what to do with myself. For nothing satisfied me, nor could I put up with myself; it truly seemed as if my soul were being wrested from me. O superb contrivance of my Lord! What delicate skill You use with Your miserable slave! You hide Yourself from me and afflict me with Your love through a death so delightful that the soul would never want to escape from it.
9. It's impossible for anyone who has not experienced them to be able to understand these impulses, which are so vehement. For they are not a disquiet of the heart. Neither are they the certain devotional feelings that often occur and seem to suffocate the spirit because they can't be contained. These devotional feelings belong to a lower form of prayer and their impetuous stirrings should be avoided by trying gently to gather them within oneself and by quieting the soul. This condition is like that of children crying so furiously that it seems they are about to be suffocated; their excessive feelings cease when they are given something to drink. So it is here. Reason should bridle these feelings because they could be caused by our own natural weakness. We should consider with fear that they are not totally perfect but can pertain in great part to the sensory portion of the soul. And let this child become quiet by a loving caress which moves it to love, by gentle means and not by blows, as they say. Let this love be held within and not resemble the pot that heats up too fast and boils over because too much wood was put on the fire. They should moderate the causes of the increase of this fire and strive to put it out with gentle and not arduous tears; for such are the tears that come from these feelings, and these tears do much harm. I myself sometimes",3,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,9,3,11,22,3,1,6,16,7,11,10,5,2,3,8,1,2,5,2
"294",1573,30,"experienced them in the beginning, and they left my head so exhausted and my spirit so tired that for another day or more I was unfit to return to prayer. Hence great discretion is necessary in the beginning so that everything may proceed gently and the spirit may be shown how to work interiorly. One should strive earnestly to avoid exterior feelings.
10. These other impulses are far different. We ourselves don't put the wood on the fire, but it seems that once the fire is going we are suddenly thrown into it so as to be burned up. The soul doesn't strive for the pain of this wound caused by the Lord's absence, but at times an arrow is thrust into the deepest and most living recesses of the heart in such a way that the soul doesn't know what has happened or what it wants. It well understands that it wants God and that the arrow seems to have been dipped in a poisonous herb so that for the love of this Lord it might despise itself; and it would gladly lose its life for Him. You can't exaggerate or describe the way in which God wounds the soul and the extreme pain this wound produces, for it causes the soul to forget itself. Yet this pain is so delightful that there is no other pleasure in life that gives greater happiness. The soul would always want, as I said, to be dying of this sickness.
11. This pain and glory joined together left me confused; I couldn't understand how such a combination was possible. Oh, what it is to see a wounded soul! I say that this reality should be understood in such a way that the soul is said to be wounded for a very sublime reason and there be clear awareness that the soul did not cause this love, but that seemingly a spark from the very great love the Lord has for it suddenly fell upon it, making it burn all over. Oh, how many times when I am in this state do I recall that verse of David: Quemadmodum desiderat cervus ad fontes aquarum; for it seems to me that I experience it literally within myself.
12. When this thirst is not too severe, it seems it can be appeased somewhat; at least the soul seeks some remedy -- for it doesn't know what to do -- through certain penances, but they are no more felt and cause no more pain than would the",0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,3,0,0,0,17,1,12,13,2,2,1,15,11,9,16,7,1,3,4,3,17,3,1
"295",1573,31,"shedding of blood from a dead body. It seeks ways and means of doing something about the love of God it feels. But this pain of love is so great that I don't know what bodily torment would take it away. Since the remedy doesn't lie in bodily penances, these penances make very poor medicine for so sublime a sickness. They can relieve it somewhat, and the soul can get along in this way while at the same time begging God to provide a cure for its sickness. But it sees no remedy other than death, for it thinks that by means of death it can enjoy its Good completely. At other times the pain becomes so severe that the soul can do neither penance nor anything else, for the whole body is paralyzed. One is unable to stir with either the feet or the arms. Rather, if one is standing, one sits down, like a person being carried from one place to another, unable even to breathe. The soul lets out some sighs -- not great ones -- because it can do no more; they are felt within.
13. The Lord wanted me while in this state to see sometimes the following vision: I saw close to me toward my left side an angel in bodily form. I don't usually see angels in bodily form except on rare occasions; although many times angels appear to me, but without my seeing them, as in the intellectual vision I spoke about before. This time, though, the Lord desired that I see the vision in the following way: the angel was not large but small; he was very beautiful, and his face was so aflame that he seemed to be one of those very sublime angels that appear to be all afire. They must belong to those they call the cherubim, for they didn't tell me their names. But I see clearly that in heaven there is so much difference between some angels and others and between these latter and still others that I wouldn't know how to explain it. I saw in his hands a large golden dart and at the end of the iron tip there appeared to be a little fire. It seemed to me this angel plunged the dart several times into my heart and that it reached deep within me. When he drew it out, I thought he was carrying off with him the deepest part of me; and he left me all on fire with",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,16,3,3,11,0,0,0,12,4,7,14,5,9,1,5,13,6,2,0
"296",1573,32,"great love of God. The pain was so great that it made me moan, and the sweetness this greatest pain caused me was so superabundant that there is no desire capable of taking it away; nor is the soul content with less then God. The pain is not bodily but spiritual, although the body doesn't fail to share in some of it, and even a great deal. The loving exchange that takes place between the soul and God is so sweet that I beg Him in goodness to give a taste of this love to anyone who thinks I am lying.
14. On the days this lasted I went about as though stupefied. I desired neither to see nor to speak, but to clasp my suffering close to me, for to me it was greater glory than all creation.
Sometimes it happened -- when the Lord desired -- that these raptures were so great that even though I was among people I couldn't resist them; to my deep affliction they began to be made public. After I experience them I don't feel this suffering so strongly; rather I experience what I mentioned before in that other part -- I don't recall which chapter -- which is very different in many respects and more valuable. But when this pain I'm now speaking of begins, it seems the Lord carries the soul away and places it in ecstasy; thus there is no room for pain or suffering, because joy soon enters in.
May He be blessed forever who grants so many favors to one who responds so poorly to gifts as great as these. 1. While I was at the monastery in Toledo, some were advising me that I shouldn't give a burying-place to anyone who had not belonged to the nobility. The Lord said to me: ""You will grow very foolish, daughter, if you look at the world's laws. Fix your eyes on me, poor and despised by the world. Will the great ones of the world, perhaps, be great before me? Or, are you to be esteemed for lineage or for virtue?""
(This concerned the advice they gave me not to grant a burying-place in Toledo to one who did not belong to the nobility). 1. A few days after the experiences mentioned above, while thinking about whether they who thought it was wrong for me to go out to found monasteries might be right, and thinking that I would do better to be always occupied in prayer, I heard the words:",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,14,0,13,24,0,2,4,8,6,8,13,3,3,4,1,3,5,2,1
"297",1573,33,"""While one is alive, progress doesn't come from trying to enjoy Me more but by trying to do My will.""
I thought that their recommendation would be God's will because of what St. Paul said about the enclosure of women, of which I was recently told and had even heard before. The Lord said to me: ""Tell them they shouldn't follow just one part of Scripture but that they should look at other parts, and ask them if they can by chance tie my hands."" In explaining the nature of union to me, He said:
1. ""Don't think, daughter, that union lies in being very close to me. For those, too, who offend me are close, although they may not want to be. Neither does it consist in favors and consolations in prayer, even though these may reach a very sublime degree. Though these favors may come from Me, they are often a means for winning souls, even souls that are not in the state of grace.""
I was experiencing a lofty elevation of the spirit when I heard those words. The Lord gave me understanding of what spirit was and in what state my soul then was and how to understand the words of the Magnificat, Exultavit spiritus meus. I wouldn't know how to describe this experience. It seems to me I was given an understanding that the spirit is the higher part of the will.
2. Getting back to union, I understood that it consists in the spirit being pure and raised above all earthly things so that there is nothing in the soul that wants to turn aside from God's will; but there is such conformity with God in spirit and will, and detachment from everything, and involvement with Him, that there is no thought of love of self or of any creature.
3. I have thought: if this is union, then we can say of a soul that invariably has determination like this that it is always in the prayer of union. It is true that this prayer of union lasts only a short while. It occurred to me that with respect to walking in uprightness, meriting, and making progress, union does last; but it cannot be said that the soul is in union as it is when in contemplation. It seems to me I understood, although not by words, that the dust of our misery, faults, and impediments, in which we again immerse ourselves, is so great that it would be impossible to have the purity the spirit",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22,1,4,13,1,2,1,16,4,10,11,6,1,7,1,1,1,1,0
"298",1573,34,"has when it is joined to God; for the spirit then leaves and rises above our wretched misery. And it seems to me that if this experience is union, that is, our will and spirit being thus made one with God's, it is impossible for anyone who is not in the state of grace to have it; for I have been told it is. So it would seem to me very difficult, unless by a special grace from God, to understand when there is union since we cannot know when we are in the state of grace.
4. Will your Reverence write me your opinion and let me know where I am mistaken, and send this paper back to me. 1. On the second day after Pentecost, while at Ecija, a person was recalling a great favor she had received from our Lord on the vigil of this feast. Desiring to do something very special in His service, she thought it would be good to promise from that time on not to hide any fault or sin she had committed in her whole life from the one who stood in God's place. Even though she had made a vow of obedience, this promise seemed to involve something more, because there's no obligation like this toward one's superiors. And she also promised to do all that this confessor might tell her -- with regard to serious matters, of course -- providing it would not go against her vow of obedience. And even though keeping this promise was hard for her in the beginning, she made it.
2. The first reason why she decided to do so was the thought that she was rendering some service to the Holy Spirit; the second was that she chose a person who was a great servant of God and a learned man, who would help her serve the Lord more.
This learned man knew nothing about the above until some days after she had made the promise. He was Friar Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios. 1. I was once thinking about whether they were going to send me to reform a certain monastery, and this troubled me. I heard: ""What do you fear? What can you lose but the lives you have so often offered me? I shall help you."" It happened on a certain occasion in such a way that my soul was much satisfied. 1. On the day the brief was presented, while I was anxiously waiting, I was all troubled and",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,16,0,11,20,3,0,2,16,11,8,14,5,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
"299",1573,35,"couldn't even pray vocally. For they had come to tell me our Father's life was in danger. It wasn't allowed for him to leave the monastery and there were so many rumors. I heard these words: ""O woman of little faith! Be calm, for things are going very well.""
2. It was the feast of the Presentation of our Lady, in the year 1575. I resolved within myself that if the Virgin would obtain from her Son that we see both our Father and ourselves freed from these friars, I would ask our Father for an indult that in all of our monasteries of the discalced nuns this feast could be celebrated with solemnity.
3. When I made this resolve I didn't recall what I had heard in the vision I'd seen, that the Father would establish a feast. Now in turning back to read this little notebook, I have wondered if the feast could be this one of the Presentation. 1. Oh, who would be able to explain to your Excellency the quiet and calm my soul experiences! It is so certain it will enjoy God that it thinks it already enjoys the possession of Him, although not the fruition. It's as though one had given another, with heavily warranted deeds, the promise of a large revenue that that other will be able to enjoy at a certain time. But until then, this latter person enjoys only the promise that he shall have the fruition of this revenue. Despite the gratitude the soul feels, it would rather not rejoice. For it thinks it hasn't deserved anything other than to serve, even if this service be through much suffering. And sometimes it even seems to it that the period from now until the end of the world would be a short time to serve the one who gave it this possession. Because, to put it truthfully, this soul is no longer in part subject to the miseries of the world as it used to be. For although it suffers more, this is only on the surface. The soul is like a lord in his castle, and so it doesn't lose its peace; although this security doesn't remove a great fear of offending God and of not getting rid of all that would be a hindrance to serving Him. The soul rather proceeds more cautiously, but it goes about so forgetful of self that it thinks it has partly lost its being. In this state everything is directed to the honor",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,2,13,0,9,23,2,2,6,10,4,15,8,6,2,3,1,0,1,1,2
"300",1573,36,"of God, to the greater fulfillment of His will, and to His glory.
2. Since this is so, it seems to me that in what pertains to the soul's body and health there is less mortification and more carefulness in eating; and in doing penance, the soul doesn't have the desires it did. But everything is, it seems, directed toward having the power to serve God more in other things. For as a great sacrifice it offers Him the care it takes of its body, and this care wearies it very much. At times it tests itself in something; but in its honest opinion it cannot do this without harm to its health, and it keeps in mind what its superiors order it to do. In this respect and in the desire it has for its health, a lot of self-love must also enter in. But, in my opinion, I think it would make me much happier, and it did make me happier, to perform a lot of penance. When I did so, it as least seemed that I was doing something; and I gave good example, and I didn't have this trial that comes from not serving God in anything. May your Excellency discern what might be the best thing to do in this regard.
3. The imaginative visions have ceased, but it seems this intellectual vision of these three Persons and of the humanity of Christ always continues. This intellectual vision, in my opinion, is something much more sublime. Now I understand, as it seems, that those imaginative visions I experienced were from God, for they disposed the soul for its present state. Since it was so miserable and had so little fortitude, God led it as He saw was necessary. In my opinion, when visions are from God they should be greatly prized.
4. The interior locutions haven't gone away, because when it's necessary our Lord gives me some advice; and even now in Palencia I would have made a big blunder, although not one involving sin, if it were not for this.
5. The acts and desires don't seem to bear the force they used to. Although they are great, much greater is the strength the soul has for doing the will of God and what is for His greater glory. Since it has well understood that His Majesty knows what is fitting for the accomplishment of this, and it is so withdrawn from self-interest, these desires and acts come to an end quickly, and in my opinion",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,16,0,3,20,1,0,1,13,10,9,21,5,1,0,0,2,3,0,1
"301",1573,37,"they don't have any force. Hence I sometimes feel fear, although not with pain and disturbance as before, that my soul is in a stupor and that I'm doing nothing because I cannot do penance. Acts of desire for suffering and martyrdom and to see God have no force, and I'm usually not able to make them. It seems I live only to eat and sleep and not suffer in anything; and even this doesn't bother me, although sometimes, as I say, I fear lest I be deceived. But I'm not able to believe that I am, because from all that I discern there doesn't reign in me any strong attachment to any creature or to all the glory of heaven, but rather to loving this God of ours. This attachment to loving God doesn't diminish; instead, in my opinion, it increases along with the desire that all serve Him.
6. But besides this love, one thing amazes me: that those interior feelings that were so extreme and used to torment me when I saw souls being lost and I thought about whether some offense was committed against God, cannot be felt by me any longer; although I don't think the desire that He not be offended is any less.
7. Your Excellency should take note that in all these experiences, present or past, I have not had the power to do anything more, nor do I now; I could serve more if I were not so wretched. But I say that if I were now to strive with great care to desire to die, I wouldn't be able to. Nor would I be able to make the acts I used to, or feel the suffering over offenses against God, or feel the fears that were so great and that I bore for so many years because it seemed to me I was being deceived. And as a result I no longer have any need to seek out learned men or tell any one anything. I only need the satisfaction of knowing whether I am going along all right or whether I can do something. I have spoken of this to some with whom I discussed the other things, that is, with Friar Domingo and Master Medina and some from the Society of Jesus. With what your Excellency might now tell me, I shall put an end to my consultations because of the great esteem I have for you. Consider it carefully for the love of God.
Neither has the knowledge",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,11,1,14,18,4,4,4,15,12,14,29,6,2,3,5,1,1,2,1
"302",1573,38,"been taken away that some souls whom I'm interested in and that die are in heaven; in the case of others, it has.
8. The solitude that makes one think cannot give that understanding to him who nursed at my mother's breast. The flight into Egypt...
9. The interior peace, and the lack of strength that pleasures or displeasures have for taking this peace away in any lasting manner,...
The presence of the three Persons is so impossible to doubt that it seems one experiences what St. John says, that they will make their abode in the soul. God does this not only by grace but also by His presence, because He wants to give the experience of this presence. It brings with it an abundance of indescribable blessings, especially the blessing that there is no need to go in search of reflections in order to know that God is there.
This presence is almost continual, except when a lot of sickness weighs down on me. For it sometimes seems God wants one to suffer without interior consolation; but, never, not even in its first stirrings, does the will turn from its desire that God's will be done in it.
This surrender to the will of God is so powerful that the soul wants neither death nor life, unless for a short time when it longs to die to see God. But soon the presence of the three Persons is represented to it so forcefully that this presence provides a remedy for the pain caused by His absence, and there remains the desire to live, if He wills, in order to serve Him more. And if through my intercession I could play a part in getting a soul to love and praise God more, even if it be for just a short time, I think that would matter more to me than being in glory. 1. O God of my soul, how we hasten to offend You and how You hasten even more to pardon us! What reason is there, Lord, for such deranged boldness? Could it be that we have already understood Your great mercy and have forgotten that Your justice is just?
The sorrows of death surround me. Oh, oh, oh, what a serious thing sin is, for it was enough to kill God with so many sorrows! And how surrounded You are by them, my God! Where can You go that they do not torment You? Everywhere mortals wound You.

"303",1573,39,"Him in such great solitude. Few are the vassals remaining with Him, and great the multitude accompanying Lucifer. And what's worse is that these latter appear as His friends in public and sell Him in secret. He finds almost no one in whom to trust. O true Friend, how badly they pay You back who betray You! O true Christians, help your God weep, for those compassionate tears are not only for Lazarus but for those who were not going to want to rise, even though His Majesty call them. O my God, how You bear in mind the faults I have committed against You! May they now come to an end, Lord, may they come to an end, and those of everyone. Raise up these dead; may Your cries be so powerful that even though they do not beg life of You, You give it to them so that afterward, my God, they might come forth from the depth of their own delights.
3. Lazarus did not ask You to raise him up. You did it for a woman sinner; behold one here, my God, and a much greater one; let Your mercy shine. I, although miserable, ask life for those who do not want to ask it of You. You already know, my King, what torment it is for me to see them so forgetful of the great endless torments they will suffer, if they don't return to You.
O you who are accustomed to delights, satisfactions, and consolations, and to always doing your own will, take pity on yourselves! Recall that you will have to be subject forever and ever, without end, to the infernal furies. Behold, behold that the Judge who will condemn you now asks you; and that your lives are not safe for one moment. Why don't you want to live forever? Oh, hardness of human hearts! May Your boundless compassion, my God, soften these hearts. CHAPTER 1
 
The reason I founded this monastery with such strict observance.
 
1. When I began to take the first steps toward founding this monastery (for the reasons given in the book I mentioned that I wrote and also because of some great favors from the Lord through which I learned that He would be greatly served in this house), it was not my intention that there be so much external austerity or that the house have no income; on the contrary, I would have desired the possibility that nothing be lacking. In sum, my intention was the",2,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,2,3,12,1,8,16,1,0,6,7,9,8,11,7,2,0,1,2,2,0,0
"304",1573,40,"intention of the weak and wretched person that I am -- although I did have some good motives besides those involving my own comfort.
2. At that time news reached me of the harm being done in France and of the havoc the Lutherans had caused and how much this miserable sect was growing. The news distressed me greatly, and, as though I could do something or were something, I cried to the Lord and begged Him that I might remedy so much evil. It seemed to me that I would have given a thousand lives to save one soul out of the many that were being lost there. I realized I was a woman and wretched and incapable of doing any of the useful things I desired to do in the service of the Lord. All my longing was and still is that since He has so many enemies and so few friends that these few friends be good ones. As a result I resolved to do the little that was in my power; that is, to follow the evangelical counsels as perfectly as I could and strive that these few persons who live here do the same. I did this trusting in the great goodness of God, who never fails to help anyone who is determined to give up everything for Him. My trust was that if these Sisters matched the ideal my desires had set for them, my faults would not have much strength in the midst of so many virtues; and I could thereby please the Lord in some way. Since we would all be occupied in prayer for those who are the defenders of the Church and for preachers and for learned men who protect her from attack, we could help as much as possible this Lord of mine who is so roughly treated by those for whom He has done so much good; it seems these traitors would want Him to be crucified again and that He have no place to lay His head.
3. O my Redeemer, my heart cannot bear these thoughts without becoming terribly grieved. What is the matter with Christians nowadays? Must it always be those who owe You the most who afflict You? Those for whom You performed the greatest works, those You have chosen for Your friends, with whom You walk and commune by means of Your sacraments? Aren't they satisfied with the torments You have suffered for them?
4. Indeed, my Lord, one who withdraws from the world",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,15,1,15,21,2,3,7,10,7,15,13,8,0,0,1,2,1,0,0
"305",1573,41,"nowadays is not doing anything. Since the world so little appreciates You, what do we expect? Do we perhaps deserve to be treated better? Have we perhaps done better toward those in the world that they would keep us in their friendship? What is this? What do we now expect, those of us who through the goodness of the Lord are freed of that contagious, scabby sore, that sect whose followers already belong to the devil? Indeed, they have won punishment with their own hands and have easily earned eternal fire with their pleasures. That's their worry! Still, my heart breaks to see how many souls are lost. Though I can't grieve so much over the evil already done -- that is irreparable -- I would not want to see more of them lost each day.
5. O my Sisters in Christ, help me beg these things of the Lord. This is why He has gathered you together here. This is your vocation. These must be the business matters you're engaged in. These must be the things you desire, the things you weep about; these must be the objects of your petitions -- not, my Sisters, the business matters of the world. For I laugh at and am even distressed about the things they come here to ask us to pray for: to ask His Majesty for wealth and money -- and this is done by persons who I wish would ask Him for the grace to trample everything underfoot. They are well intentioned, and in the end we pray for their intentions because of their devotion -- although for myself I don't think the Lord ever hears me when I pray for these things. The world is all in flames; they want to sentence Christ again, so to speak, since they raise a thousand false witnesses against Him; they want to ravage His Church -- and are we to waste time asking for things that if God were to give them we'd have one soul less in heaven? No, my Sisters, this is not the time to be discussing with God matters that have little importance.
6. Indeed, were I not to consider the human weakness that is consoled by receiving help in time of need (and it is good that we help insofar as we can), I'd be happy only if people understood that these are not the things they should be begging God for with so much care.

"306",1573,42,"bodily needs and of the blessing there is in poverty.
 
1. Don't think, my Sisters, that because you do not strive to please those who are in the world you will lack food. I assure you that such will not be the case. Never seek sustenance through human schemes, for you will die of hunger -- and rightly so. Your eyes on your Spouse! He will sustain you. Once He is pleased, those least devoted to you will give you food even though they may not want to, as you have seen through experience. If in following this advice you should die of hunger, blessed be the nuns of St. Joseph's! For the love of the Lord, do not forget this. Since you have given up an income, give up worry about food. If you don't, everything will be lost. God wants some to have an income, and in their case it's all right for them to worry about their income since that goes with their vocation; but for us to worry, Sisters, would be absurd.
2. Worry about financial resources of others, it seems to me, would amount to thinking about what others are enjoying. Indeed, your worry won't make the other change his thinking, nor will it inspire him with the idea to give alms. Leave this worrying to the One who can move all, for He is the Lord of money and of those who earn money. By His command we came here. His words are true; they cannot fail; rather, heaven and earth will fail. Let us not fail Him; do not fear that He will fail you. And if some time He should fail you, it will be for a greater good. The lives of the saints failed when they were killed because of the Lord, but this happened so that through martyrdom their glory would be increased. It would be a good exchange to give up everything for the enjoyment of everlasting abundance.
3. Sisters, what I am saying is so important that I want you to remember it after my death -- and that's why I'm leaving it for you in writing -- for while I live I will remind you of it. I have seen by experience the great gain that comes from not worrying about such things. The less there is the more carefree I become. The Lord knows that, in my opinion, it distresses me more when we have a large surplus than when we are in need. I don't",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13,0,0,8,10,4,17,18,9,1,7,9,7,16,8,8,3,1,0,2,0,1,5
"307",1573,43,"know if this is because I've experienced that the Lord immediately gives what we need. For us to worry about money would amount to deceiving the world, making ourselves poor in an exterior way but not being poor in spirit. I would feel scrupulous, so to speak, and it would seem to me as though a rich person were begging alms. Please God such may not be the case, for where there are too many cares about whether others will give us alms, sooner or later these cares will become habitual; or it could happen that we would go asking for what we have no need of, perhaps from someone more needy than we ourselves. Although those who give to us cannot lose anything but only gain, we would be losing. No, please God, my daughters! If you should start worrying like this, I would prefer that you have an income.
4. I beg you for the love of God and as an alms to me, in no way let your thoughts be taken up with these cares. If at any time such cares should be present in this house, let the youngest Sister cry out to His Majesty and bring the matter to the attention of the prioress. She may humbly tell the prioress that the latter is mistaken, and so mistaken that little by little true poverty will be lost. I hope in the Lord that this will never happen and that He will not abandon His servants. May this book you have asked me to write, even if it does no more, serve to awaken you in these matters.
5. Believe me, my daughters, that for your good the Lord has given me a little understanding of the blessings that lie in holy poverty. Those who experience them will understand, though perhaps not as much as I. For not only had I failed to be poor in spirit, even though I professed it, but I was foolish in spirit. Poverty of spirit is a good that includes within itself all the good things of the world. [And I believe it has many of the good things contained in all the virtues. I am not saying this for certain, because I don't know the worth of each virtue. I will not speak about what in my opinion I do not understand well. But, for myself, I hold that poverty of spirit embraces many of the virtues.] In it lies great dominion. I say that it gives once again",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,12,13,0,13,22,2,1,6,13,3,19,17,5,0,4,1,0,0,1,0
"308",1573,44,"to one who doesn't care about the world's good things dominion over them all. What do kings and lords matter to me if I don't want their riches, or don't care to please them if in order to do so I would have to displease God in even the smallest thing? Nor what do I care about their honors if I have understood that the greatest honor of a poor person lies in the fact of his being truly poor?
6. In my opinion honor and money almost always go together; anyone who wants honor doesn't despise money, and anyone who despises money doesn't care much about honor. Let this be clearly understood, for it seems to me that the desire for honor always brings with it some interest in money or income. It would be a wonder if any poor person were honored in the world; on the contrary, even though he may be worthy of honor, he is little esteemed. True poverty brings with it overwhelming honor. Poverty that is chosen for God alone has no need of pleasing anyone but Him. It is certain that in having need of no one a person has many friends. I have become clearly aware of this through experience.
7. So much is written about this virtue that I wouldn't know how to understand it all or still less speak of it. And so in order not to do an injustice to this virtue by trying to praise it, I will say no more. I have only spoken of what I have seen through experience, and I confess that until now I have been so absorbed in speaking of these things that I did not realize I was doing so. But since I have written this, for the love of the Lord, keep in mind that holy poverty is our insignia and a virtue which at the beginning, when our order was founded, was so esteemed and well kept by our holy fathers. For I have been told, by someone who knows, that they did not keep anything for the next day. If exteriorly we do not carry out this practice so perfectly, let us strive to do so interiorly. Life lasts but a couple of hours; exceedingly great will be the reward. If we should do nothing else but what the Lord counseled us to do, the pay of just being able in some way to imitate Him would be great.
8. These are the insignia that must be on our",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,13,9,0,5,32,1,3,2,11,3,17,22,12,1,4,0,0,1,1,0
"309",1573,45,"coat of arms, for we must desire to observe poverty in every way: in houses, clothing, words, and most of all in thought. As long as you do this, have no fear that the religious life in this house will fail; God will help. As St. Clare said, great walls are those of poverty. She said that it was with walls like these, and those of humility, that she wanted to enclose her monasteries. Surely, if poverty is truly observed, recollection and all the other virtues will be much better fortified than with very sumptuous buildings. Be careful of buildings like these; I beg you for the love of God and by His precious blood. And if I can say this in good conscience, may such a building fall to the ground the day you construct one.
9. It looks very bad, my daughters, if large houses are built with money from the poor. May God not allow it. The houses must be poor and small in every way. Let us in some manner resemble our King, who had no house but the stable in Bethlehem where He was born and the cross where He died. These were houses where there was little room for recreation. Those who build large ones know what they are doing; they have other holy intentions. But for thirteen poor little women, any corner should be enough. If it is necessary because of the extremely secluded life you live to have a stretch of land (and this even helps prayer and devotion) with some hermitages where you can withdraw to pray, well and good. But no buildings, or large and ornate house. God deliver us from them! Always remember that everything will come tumbling down on the day of judgment. Who knows whether this will come soon?
10. Now it would not be right for the house of thirteen poor little women to make a loud crash when it falls; the truly poor must make no noise. They must be noiseless people so that others will take pity on them. And how they will rejoice when they see someone who was freed from hell because of the alms he gave them! That's all possible because they are much obliged to pray continually for the souls of their benefactors, since their food comes from them. The Lord also desires that, even though it comes from Him, we show gratitude to those persons through whose means He gives this food to us. Do not be negligent about",4,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,2,9,9,13,1,5,18,1,1,2,6,9,13,13,16,2,5,0,2,2,1,2
"310",1573,46,"showing gratitude.
11. I don't know what I began to say, for I have wandered off the subject. I believe the Lord wanted me to do so, for I never thought about saying what I have said here. May His Majesty always help us so that we never fail in the practice of poverty, amen.

CHAPTER 3
 
Continues the subject she began to discuss in the first chapter; she urges her Sisters always to busy themselves begging God to help those who labor for the Church. The chapter ends with an earnest plea.
 
1. To return to the main reason the Lord brought us together in this house and why I have greatly desired that we live so as to please His Majesty, I want to speak of helping to remedy the great evils I have seen. Human forces are not sufficient to stop the spread of this fire caused by these heretics, even though people have tried to see if with the force of arms they could remedy all the evil that is making such progress. It has seemed to me that what is necessary is a different approach, the approach of a lord when in time of war his land is overrun with enemies and he finds himself restricted on all sides. He withdraws to a city that he has well fortified and from there sometimes strikes his foe. Those who are in the city, being chosen people, are such that they can do more by themselves than many cowardly soldiers can. And often victory is won in this way. At least, even though victory is not won, these chosen people are not conquered. For since they have no traitor, they cannot be conquered -- unless through starvation. In this example the starvation cannot be such as to force them to surrender -- to die, yes; but not to surrender.
2. But why have I said this? So that you understand, my Sisters, that what we must ask God is that in this little castle where there are already good Christians not one of us will go over to the enemy and that God will make the captains of this castle or city, who are the preachers and theologians, very advanced in the way of the Lord. Since most of them belong to religious orders, ask God that they advance very far in the perfection of religious life and their vocation; this is most necessary. For as I have said, it is the ecclesiastical, not the secular arm that",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1,2,15,2,7,9,0,6,1,7,11,6,8,10,2,6,1,2,1,0,0
"311",1573,47,"will save us. Since in neither the ecclesiastical nor the secular arm can we be of any help to our King, let us strive to be the kind of persons whose prayers can be useful in helping those servants of God who through much toil have strengthened themselves with learning and a good life and have labored so as now to help the Lord.
3. You may perhaps ask why I am stressing this so much, and saying that we must help those who are better than we ourselves are. I will tell you why: it is because I don't think that as yet you understand well how much you owe the Lord for bringing you here where you are so removed from business affairs, occasions of sin, and worldly occupations. Indeed, it is a very great mercy. As for those persons I mentioned, who are not free in this way, it is good that they are not free; more so in these times than in the past. They are the persons who must strengthen people who are weak, and encourage the little ones. A fine state things would be in -- soldiers without captains! These persons must live among men, deal with men, live in palaces, and even sometimes outwardly behave as such men do. Do you think, my daughters, that little is required for them to deal with the world, live in the world, engage in its business, and, as I said, resemble it in its conversation, while interiorly remaining its strangers, its enemies; in sum, not being men but angels? For if they do not live in this way, they do not deserve to be called captains; nor may the Lord allow them to leave their cells, for they will do more harm than good. This is not the time for seeing imperfections in those who must teach.
4. And if they are not interiorly fortified through an understanding of the importance of trampling everything underfoot, of detachment from things that come to an end, and of attachment to eternal things, they will show some sign of this lack no matter how much they try to conceal it. Is it not the world they have to deal with? Have no fear that the world will forgive this deficiency; nor is there any imperfection it fails to recognize. It will overlook many good things and perhaps not even consider them good; but have no fear that it will overlook any evil or imperfect things. Now I wonder who",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,5,8,0,9,21,3,2,1,9,7,8,13,6,1,2,0,1,2,0,0
"312",1573,48,"it is that teaches people in the world about perfection, not so much that these people might seek perfection (for it doesn't seem to them they have any obligation to do this, but they think they are doing enough if they keep the commandments reasonably well), but that they might condemn others. And at times what is virtuous seems to them luxury. So, then, do not think that little help from God is necessary for this great battle these preachers and theologians are fighting; a very great deal is necessary.
5. I beg you to strive to be such that we might merit from God two things: First, that among the numerous learned men and religious there be many who will meet these requirements I mentioned that are necessary for this battle, and that the Lord may prepare those who do not meet them; one who is perfect will do much more than many who are not. Second, that after being placed in this combat, which, as I say, is not easy, they may receive protection from the Lord so as to remain free of the many perils there are in the world, and stop their ears in order not to hear the siren's song on this dangerous sea. If we can obtain some answers from God to these requests, we shall be fighting for Him even though we are very cloistered. And if some of our requests are answered, I would consider well worthwhile the trials I have suffered in order to found this little corner, where I have also sought that this rule of our Lady and Empress be observed with the perfection with which it was observed when initiated.
6. Do not think it is useless to have these petitions continually in your heart, for with some persons it seems a difficult thing for them not to be praying a great deal for their own soul. But what better prayer is there than these petitions I mentioned? If you are uneasy because you think your sufferings in purgatory will not be shortened, know that by this prayer they will be; and if you must still pay some debts, so be it. What would it matter were I to remain in purgatory until judgment day if through my prayer I could save even one soul? How much less would it matter if my prayer is to the advantage of many and for the honor of the Lord. Pay no attention to sufferings that come to an end if",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,4,18,0,9,18,1,5,2,15,3,13,21,8,0,4,0,2,0,0,0
"313",1573,49,"through them some greater service is rendered to Him who endured so many for us. Always try to be informed about what is more perfect [for as I will ask you later, and will give my reasons, you must always communicate with learned men].
So, then, I beg you for the love of the Lord to ask His Majesty to hear us in this matter. Miserable though I am, I ask His Majesty this since it is for His glory and the good of the Church; this glory and good is the object of my desires.
7. It seems bold that I think I could play some role in obtaining an answer to these petitions. I trust, my Lord, in these Your servants who live here, and I know they desire and strive for nothing else than to please You. For You they renounced the little they had -- and would have wanted to have more so as to serve You with it. Since You, my Creator, are not ungrateful, I think You will not fail to do what they beg of You. Nor did You, Lord, when You walked in the world, despise women; rather, You always, with great compassion, helped them. [And You found as much love and more faith in them than You did in men. Among them was Your most blessed Mother, and through her merits -- and because we wear her habit -- we merit what, because of our offenses, we do not deserve. Is it not enough, Lord, that the world has intimidated us ... so that we may not do anything worthwhile for You in public or dare speak some truths that we lament over in secret, without Your also failing to hear so just a petition? I do not believe, Lord, that this could be true of Your goodness and justice, for You are a just judge and not like those of the world. Since the world's judges are sons of Adam and all of them men, there is no virtue in women that they do not hold suspect. Yes, indeed, the day will come, my King, when everyone will be known for what he is. I do not speak for myself, because the world already knows my wickedness -- and I have rejoiced that this wickedness is known publicly -- but because I see that these are times in which it would be wrong to undervalue virtuous and strong souls, even though they are women.] When we ask You for honors,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,9,0,11,26,1,5,4,15,8,9,8,9,1,4,0,1,0,2,0
"314",1573,50,"income, money, or worldly things, do not hear us. But when we ask You for the honor of Your Son, why wouldn't You hear us, eternal Father, for the sake of Him who lost a thousand honors and a thousand lives for You? Not for us, Lord, for we don't deserve it, but for the blood of Your son and His merits.
8. O eternal Father, see to it that so many lashes and injuries and such heavy torments are not forgotten! How then, my Creator, can a heart as loving as Yours allow that the deeds done by Your Son with such ardent love and so as to make us more pleasing to You (for You commanded that He love us) be esteemed so little? For nowadays these heretics have so little regard for the Blessed Sacrament that they take away its dwelling places by destroying churches. Was something still to be done to please You? But He did everything. Wasn't it enough eternal Father, that while He lived He did not have a place to lay His head -- and always in the midst of so many trials? But now they take away the places He has at present for inviting His friends, for he realizes that we are weak and knows that the laborers must be nourished with such food. Hasn't He already paid far more than enough for the sin of Adam? Whenever we sin again must this loving Lamb pay? Don't allow this, my Emperor! Let Your Majesty be at once appeased! Do not look at our sins but behold that Your most blessed Son redeemed us, and behold His merits and those of His glorious Mother and of so many saints and martyrs who died for You!
9. Ay, what a pity, Lord, and who has dared to make this petition on behalf of all of us? What a bad intermediary, my daughters, is she who seeks to be heard and to make such a petition for you! Indeed, this sovereign Judge should become more indignant -- and rightly and justly so -- at seeing me so bold! But behold, my Lord, that You are a God of mercy; have mercy on this little sinner, this little worm that is so bold with You. Behold, my God, my desires and the tears with which I beg this of You; forget my deeds because of who You are; have pity on so many souls that are being lost, and help Your Church. Don't allow any",1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,4,17,1,12,16,1,1,5,3,9,5,4,6,3,3,1,3,2,2,1
"316",1574,1,"Sometimes they feel a frenzy for doing penance without rhyme or reason, a frenzy that lasts only a couple of days, so to speak. Subsequently, the devil makes them imagine that the penances did them harm. No more penance! Not even, after some attempts, what the order commands. You don't know when the captain will call you and give you more work, disguised in delight. If he doesn't, you should understand that you are not suited for it and that such a situation is what is fitting for you.  grow accustomed to recalling that the Lord is present within you and to speaking with Him often It is a wonderful comfort to see an image of our Lady or of some saint to whom we are devoted -- how much more of Christ -- and something that greatly awakens devotion and that I would like to see at every turn of my head and glance of my eyes. As I say, then, this love is recognized when it is present, just as the love between a man and woman cannot be concealed; the more it is hidden the more it seems to reveal itself. However, since the love is for nothing but a worm, it doesn't even deserve the name 'love'; for it is founded on nothing -- it's disgusting to make this comparison. And could one conceal a love so strong as is love of God, founded on such cement, having so much to love and so many reasons for loving? In sum, it is love and merits the name 'love,' for where it is present the vanities of the world must be shunned. CHAPTER 7

From what I have known, sometimes the delight is so excessive that it seems to dissolve the soul in such a way that there is no longer any desire to live. And do you ask for flowers?

"317",1574,2,"soul arrives here. But this interpretation doesn't fit well because the bride says: sustain me with flowers. Asking to be sustained doesn't seem to me to involve a request for death but for life and the desire to serve in some way the One to whom she sees she owes so much.
2. Don't think, daughters, there is any exaggeration in saying that she dies. As I have said, it indeed happens that love sometimes operates with such force that it rules over all the powers of the natural subject. Thus, I know a person who while in this kind of prayer heard someone, with a beautiful voice, singing; and she certifies that, in her opinion, if the singing had not stopped the soul would have gone out of itself on account of the great delight and sweetness the Lord gave it to enjoy. His Majesty provided that the singing stop, for the one who was in this suspension could easily have died. But because she was powerless to stir or make any exterior movement, she couldn't tell the one singing to stop. And she was clearly aware of the danger she was in, but her state resembled that of some one in a deep sleep who is unable to come out of it and speak even though he may want to.
3. In this suspension the soul would not want to come out of this sleep, nor would death be painful to it but great happiness, for this is what it desires. And how happy a death it would be, at the hands of this love! But sometimes His Majesty gives it light to see that living is good for it. However, the soul sees that its natural weakness will not be able to suffer that good for long if the delight lasts, and begs Him for another good so as to escape from that one that is so extraordinary, and thus it says: sustain me with flowers.
The fragrance of these flowers is different from the fragrance of flowers we smell here below. I understand by these words that the soul is asking to perform great works in the service of our Lord and of its neighbor. For this purpose it is happy to lose that delight and satisfaction. Although a person's life will become more active than contemplative, and one will seemingly lose if the petition is granted, Martha and Mary never fail to work almost together when the soul is in this state. For in the active",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,1,2,9,5,7,22,0,1,4,9,8,13,16,4,4,7,1,3,5,2,0
"318",1574,3,"-- and seemingly exterior -- work the soul is working interiorly. And when the active works rise from this interior root, they become lovely and very fragrant flowers. For they proceed from this tree of God's love and are done for Him alone, without any self-interest. The fragrance from these flowers spreads to the benefit of many. It is a fragrance that lasts, not passing quickly, but having great effect.
4. I want to explain myself further so that you understand. Someone preaches a sermon with the intention of benefitting souls, but he is not so detached from human considerations that he doesn't make some attempt to please, or to gain honor or credit; or he had his mind set on receiving some canonry for having preached well. There are also other things people do for their neighbor's benefit -- many things -- and with a good intention, but with much care not to lose anything through them and not to displease. They fear persecution; they want to be pleasing to kings, lords, and the people; they proceed with the discretion the world so much honors. This discretion is a shelter for many imperfections; they call it ""discretion,"" and please God it will be.
5. These persons will serve His Majesty, and they profit much. But, in my opinion, such are not the works and flowers asked for by the bride; she looks only for the honor and glory of God in everything. Truly, I don't believe that souls brought to this state by the Lord, from what I have understood of some, think of themselves, and of whether they will lose or gain, any more than if they did not exist. They look only at serving and pleasing the Lord. And because they know the love He has for His servants, they like to leave aside their own satisfaction and good so as to please Him and serve and tell souls beneficial truths by the best means they can. Nor do they, as I say, think about whether or not they will themselves lose. They keep before their minds the benefit of their neighbor, nothing else. So as to please God more, they forget themselves for their neighbor's sake, and they lose their lives in the challenge, as did many martyrs. They are not aware of the words they say while enveloped in so sublime a love of God, in their inebriation from that heavenly wine. And if they are aware, they don't care if they displease men. These",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,3,2,15,0,6,35,1,0,5,13,6,5,17,3,2,2,0,0,0,3,1
"319",1574,4,"souls do much good.
6. I recall now what I have often thought concerning that holy Samaritan woman, for she must have been wounded by this herb. How well she must have taken into her heart the words of the Lord, since she left the Lord for the gain and profit of the people of her village. This explains well what I am saying. And in payment for her great charity, she merited to be believed and to see the wonderful good our Lord did in that village.
It seems to me that one of the greatest consolations a person can have on earth must be to see other souls helped through his own efforts. Then, it seems to me, one eats the delicious fruit of these flowers. Happy are those to whom the Lord grants these favors. These souls are indeed obligated to serve Him. This holy woman, in that divine intoxication, went shouting through the streets. What amazes me is to see how the people believed her -- a woman. And she must not have been well-off since she went to draw water. Indeed she was very humble because when the Lord told her faults to her she didn't become offended (as the world does now, for the truth is hard to bear), but she told Him that He must be a prophet. In sum, the people believed her; and a large crowd, on her word alone, went out of the city to meet the Lord.
7. So I say that much good is done by those who, after speaking with His Majesty for several years, when receiving His gifts and delights, want to serve in laborious ways even though these delights and consolations are thereby hindered. I say that the fragrance of these flowers and works produced and flowing from the tree of such fervent love lasts much longer. One of these souls does more good with its words and works than do many others whose works carry the dust of our sensuality and some self-interest.
8. From these flowers comes the fruit, the apples of which the bride then says: Surround me with apples. Give me trials, Lord; give me persecutions. And truly this soul desires them and indeed passes through them well. For since it no longer looks to its own satisfaction but to what pleases God, its pleasure is in somehow imitating the laborious life that Christ lived.
By the ""apple tree,"" I understand the tree of the cross because it is said in another verse in",1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,8,0,0,3,18,0,3,25,0,1,1,10,8,7,5,10,4,7,1,1,3,1,4
"320",1574,5,"the Song of Songs: under the apple tree I raised you up. And a soul that is surrounded by crosses, trials, and persecutions has a powerful remedy against often continuing in the delight of contemplation. It finds great delight in suffering; but suffering doesn't consume it and waste its strength, as would this suspension, if very frequent, of the faculties in contemplation. And the soul also has another reason for making this request, for it must not be always enjoying without serving and working in something. I notice in some persons -- there are not many because of our sins -- that the more they advance in this kind of prayer and the gifts of our Lord the more attention they pay to the needs of their neighbor, especially to the needs to their neighbors' souls. For to draw one soul away from mortal sin it seems such persons would give many lives, as I said at the beginning.
9. Who will make those to whom our Lord begins to give these delights believe this? But perhaps it will seem to them that such persons are not making good use of their lives and that to remain in a corner enjoying this delight is what is important. It belongs to the Lord's providence, in my opinion, that these beginners do not understand where these other souls are because with this initial fervor they would immediately want to leap forward to that stage. But such a quick move ahead does not suit them, for they are still not weaned. It's necessary that they be nourished some days more with the milk I mentioned at the beginning. Let them remain close to those divine breasts, for the Lord will take care, when they are strong, to bring them further. Otherwise, they would not do the good they think; rather they would harm themselves. Since in the book I mentioned you will find very detailed explanations about when a soul may go out to benefit others and about the danger that lies in going out ahead of time, I do not want to mention the matter here or enlarge upon this any more. When I began, my intention was simply to explain how you can find comfort when you hear some words from the Song of Songs, and how, even though they are obscure to your understanding, you can reflect upon the profound mysteries contained in them. It would be bold of me to go on at any greater length.
10. May it",3,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5,2,1,14,1,7,17,0,2,2,17,11,13,17,3,0,6,0,1,0,1,1
"321",1574,6,"please the Lord that what I have said may not have been bold. The work has been done to obey the one who commanded me to do it. May His Majesty be served in everything. If something good is here, you can indeed believe that it does not come from me; the Sisters here with me have seen that because of my many occupations I have written this hastily. Beseech His Majesty that I may understand through experience what has been said. Any Sister who thinks she has some experience of these delights should praise our Lord and ask Him for the latter-mentioned works and trials so that the gain will not be just for herself.
May it please our Lord to keep us in His hands and teach us always how to carry out His will, amen. THE SEVENTH DWELLING PLACES
 
Contains Four Chapters
CHAPTER 1
 
Treats of the great favors God grants souls that have entered the seventh dwelling places. Tells how in her opinion there is a certain difference between the soul and the spirit, although the soul is all one. The chapter contains noteworthy doctrine.
 
1. You will think, Sisters, that since so much has been said about this spiritual path it will be impossible for anything more to be said. Such a thought would be very foolish. Since the greatness of God is without limits, His works are too. Who will finish telling of His mercies and grandeurs? To do so is impossible, and thus do not be surprised at what was said, and will be said, because it is but a naught in comparison to what there is to tell of God. He grants us a great favor in having communicated these things to a person through whom we can know about them. Thus the more we know about His communication to creatures the more we will praise His grandeur and make the effort to have esteem for souls in which the Lord delights so much. Each one of us has a soul, but since we do not prize souls as is deserved by creatures made in the image of God we do not understand the deep secrets that lie in them.
May it please His Majesty, if He may thereby be served to move my pen and give me understanding of how I might say something about the many things to be said and which God reveals to the one whom He places in this dwelling place. I have earnestly begged this of His",2,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,20,0,4,18,3,0,0,11,13,6,15,5,2,8,1,1,0,0,0
"322",1574,7,"Majesty since He knows that my intention is to make known His mercies that His name may be more praised and glorified.
2. I hope, not for myself but for you, Sisters, that He may grant me this favor. Thus you will understand how important it is for you not to impede your Spouses celebration of this spiritual marriage with your souls, since this marriage brings so many blessings, as you will see. O great God! It seems that a creature as miserable as I should tremble to deal with a thing so foreign to what I deserve to understand. And, indeed, I have been covered with confusion wondering if it might not be better to conclude my discussion of this dwelling place with just a few words. For it seems to me that others will think I know about it through experience. This makes me extremely ashamed; for, knowing what I am, such a thought is a terrible thing. On the other hand, the thought of neglecting to explain this dwelling place seemed to me to be a temptation and weakness on my part, no matter how many of the above judgments you make about me. May God be praised and understood a little more, and let all the world cry out against me; how much more so in that I will perhaps be dead when what I write is seen. May He be blessed who lives, and will live, forever, amen.
3. When our Lord is pleased to have pity on this soul that He has already taken spiritually as His spouse because of what it suffers and has suffered through its desires, He brings it, before the spiritual marriage is consummated, into His dwelling place which is this seventh. For just as in heaven so in the soul His Majesty must have a room where He dwells alone. Let us call it another heaven. Its very important for us, Sisters, not to think the soul is something dark. Since we do not see the soul, it usually seems that there is no such thing as interior light but only the exterior light which we all see, and that a certain darkness is in our soul. As for the soul that is not in grace, I confess this is so, but not through any fault of the Sun of Justice who dwells within it giving it being but because such a soul is incapable of receiving the light, as I believe I have said in the first dwelling",2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,22,1,19,17,10,0,7,20,14,5,17,7,4,1,1,1,1,0,0
"323",1574,8,"place, according to what a certain person understood. For these unfortunate souls are as though in a dark prison, bound hands and feet, in regard to doing anything good that would enable them to merit, and blind and deaf. We can rightly take pity on them and reflect that at one time we were ourselves in this condition and that the Lord can also have mercy on them.
4. Let us take special care, Sisters, to beg this mercy of Him and not be careless, for it is a most generous alms to pray for those who are in mortal sin. Suppose we were to see a Christian with his hands fastened behind his back by a strong chain, bound to a post, and dying of hunger, not because of lack of food, for there are very choice dishes beside him, but because he cannot take hold of the food and eat, and even has great loathing for it; and suppose he sees that he is about to breathe his last and die, not just an earthly death but an eternal one. Wouldn't it be a terrible cruelty to stand looking at him and not feed him? Well, then, what if through your prayer the chains could be loosed? The answer is obvious. For the love of God I ask you always to remember in your prayers souls in mortal sin.
5. We are not speaking about them now but about those who already by the mercy of God have done penance for their sins and are in the state of grace. Thus we are not reflecting on something restricted to a corner but on an interior world where there is room for so many and such attractive dwelling places, as you have seen; and indeed it is right that the soul be like this since within it there is a dwelling place for God.
Now then, when His Majesty is pleased to grant the soul this divine marriage that was mentioned, He first brings it into His own dwelling place. He desires that the favor be different from what it was at other times when He gave the soul raptures. I really believe that in rapture he unites it with Himself, as well as in the prayer of union that was mentioned. But it doesn't seem to the soul that it is called to enter into its center, as it is here in this dwelling place, but called to the superior part. These things matter little; whether the experience comes",4,2,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,23,5,12,18,4,1,1,8,4,6,7,4,5,2,3,4,2,1,6
"324",1574,9,"in one way or another, the Lord joins the soul to Himself. But He does so by making it blind and deaf, as was St. Paul in his conversion, and by taking away perception of the nature and kind of favor enjoyed, for the great delight the soul then feels is to see itself near God. Yet when He joins it to Himself, it doesn't understand anything; for all the faculties are lost.
6. In this seventh dwelling place the union comes about in a different way: our good God now desires to remove the scales from the soul's eyes and let it see and understand, although in a strange way, something of the favor He grants it. When the soul is brought into that dwelling place, the Most Blessed Trinity, all three Persons, through an intellectual vision, is revealed to it through a certain representation of the truth. First there comes an enkindling in the spirit in the manner of a cloud of magnificent splendor; and these Persons are distinct, and through an admirable knowledge the soul understands as a most profound truth that all three Persons are one substance and one power and one knowledge and one God alone. It knows in such a way that what we hold by faith, it understands, we can say, through sight -- although the sight is not with the bodily eyes nor with the eyes of the soul, because we are not dealing with an imaginative vision. Here all three Persons communicate themselves to it, speak to it, and explain those words of the Lord in the Gospel: that He and the Father and the Holy Spirit will come to dwell with the soul that loves Him and keeps His commandments.
7. Oh, God help me! How different is hearing and believing these words from understanding their truth in this way! Each day this soul becomes more amazed, for these Persons never seem to leave it any more, but it clearly beholds, in the way that was mentioned, that they are within it. In the extreme interior, in some place very deep within itself, the nature of which it doesn't know how to explain, because of a lack of learning, it perceives this divine company.
8. You may think that as a result the soul will be outside itself and so absorbed that it will be unable to be occupied with anything else. On the contrary, the soul is much more occupied than before with everything pertaining to the service of God;",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,23,0,6,19,3,0,2,21,6,2,10,12,8,4,1,4,2,1,0
"325",1574,10,"and once its duties are over it remains with that enjoyable company. If the soul does not fail God, He will never fail, in my opinion, to make His presence clearly known to it. It has strong confidence that since God has granted this favor He will not allow it to lose the favor. Though the soul thinks this, it goes about with greater care than ever not to displease Him in anything.
9. It should be understood that this presence is not felt so fully, I mean so clearly, as when revealed the first time or at other times when God grants the soul this gift. For if the presence were felt so clearly, the soul would find it impossible to be engaged in anything else or even to live among people. But even though the presence is not perceived with this very clear light, the soul finds itself in this company every time it takes notice. Let's say that the experience resembles that of a person who after being in a bright room with others finds himself, once the shutters are closed, in darkness. The light by which he could see them is taken away. Until it returns he doesn't see them, but not for that reason does he stop knowing they are present. It might be asked whether the soul can see them when it so desires and the light returns. To see them does not lie in its power, but depends on when our Lord desires that the window of the intellect be opened. Great is the mercy He shows in never departing from the soul and in desiring that it perceive Him so manifestly.
10. It seems that the divine Majesty desires, through this wonderful company, to prepare the soul for more. Clearly, the soul will be truly helped in every way to advance in perfection and to lose the fear it sometimes had of the other favors He granted it, as was said. Such was the experience of this person, for in everything she found herself improved, and it seemed to her, despite the trials she underwent and the business affairs she had to attend to, that the essential part of her soul never moved from that room. As a result, it seemed to her that there was, in a certain way, a division in her soul. And while suffering some great trials a little after God granted her this favor, she complained of that part of the soul, as Martha complained of Mary,",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,3,1,19,0,8,19,1,0,5,19,6,10,14,17,5,2,2,0,0,0,0
"326",1574,11,"and sometimes pointed out that it was there always enjoying that quietude at its own pleasure while leaving her in the midst of so many trials and occupations that she could not keep it company.
11. This will seem to you, daughters, to be foolishness, but it truly happens in this way. Although we know that the soul is all one, what I say is no mere fancy; the experience is very common. Wherefore I said that interior things are seen in such a way that one understands with certitude that there is some kind of difference, a difference clearly recognized, between the soul and the spirit, even though they are both one. So delicate a division is perceived that sometimes it seems the one functions differently from the other, and so does the savor the Lord desires to give them seem different. It also seems to me that the soul and the faculties are not one but different. There are so many and such delicate things in the interior that it would be boldness on my part to set out to explain them. In heaven we will see all this, if the Lord in His mercy grants us the favor of bringing us there where we shall understand these secrets.

CHAPTER 2
 
Continues on the same subject. Explains the difference between spiritual union and spiritual marriage. Describes this difference through some delicate comparisons.
 
1. Now then Let us deal with the divine and spiritual marriage, although this great favor does not come to its perfect fullness as long as we live; for if we were to withdraw from God, this remarkable blessing would be lost.
The first time the favor is granted, His Majesty desires to show Himself to the soul through an imaginative vision of His most sacred humanity so that the soul will understand and not be ignorant of receiving this sovereign gift. With other persons the favor will be received in another form. With regard to the one of whom we are speaking, the Lord represented Himself to her, just after she had received Communion, in the form of shining splendor, beauty, and majesty, as He was after His resurrection, and told her that now it was time that she consider as her own what belonged to Him and that He would take care of what was hers, and He spoke other words destined more to be heard than to be mentioned.
2. It may seem that this experience was nothing new since at other times the Lord",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,19,0,3,19,0,0,1,16,1,8,13,6,4,6,0,0,0,0,0
"327",1574,12,"had represented Himself to the soul in such a way. The experience was so different that it left her indeed stupefied and frightened: first, because this vision came with great force; second, because of the words the Lord spoke to her; and also because in the interior of her soul, where He represented Himself to her, she had not seen other visions except the former one. You must understand that there is the greatest difference between all the previous visions and those of this dwelling place. Between the spiritual betrothal and the spiritual marriage the difference is as great as that which exists between two who are betrothed and two who can no longer be separated.
3. I have already said that even though these comparisons are used, because there are no others better suited to our purpose, it should be understood that in this state there is no more thought of the body than if the soul were not in it, but one's thought is only of the spirit. In the spiritual marriage, there is still much less remembrance of the body because this secret union takes place in the very interior center of the soul, which must be where God Himself is, and in my opinion there is no need of any door for Him to enter. I say there is no need of any door because everything that has been said up until now seems to take place by means of the senses and faculties, and this appearance of the humanity of the Lord must also. But that which comes to pass in the union of the spiritual marriage is very different. The Lord appears in this center of the soul, not in an imaginative vision but in an intellectual one, although more delicate than those mentioned, as He appeared to the apostles without entering through the door when He said to them pax vobis. What God communicates here to the soul in an instant is a secret so great and a favor so sublime -- and the delight the soul experiences so extreme -- that I don't know what to compare it to. I can say only that the Lord wishes to reveal for that moment, in a more sublime manner than through any spiritual vision or taste, the glory of heaven. One can say no more -- insofar as can be understood -- than that the soul, I mean the spirit, is made one with God. For since His Majesty is also spirit, He",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,24,0,2,10,2,0,0,15,11,8,9,6,1,7,0,2,0,0,1
"328",1574,13,"has wished to show His love for us by giving some persons understanding of the point to which this love reaches so that we might praise His grandeur. For He has desired to be so joined with the creature that, just as those who are married cannot be separated, He doesn't want to be separated from the soul.
4. The spiritual betrothal is different, for the two often separate. And the union is also different because, even though it is the joining of two things into one, in the end the two can be separated and each remains by itself. We observe this ordinarily, for the favor of union with the Lord passes quickly, and afterward the soul remains without that company; I mean, without awareness of it. In this other favor from the Lord, no. The soul always remains with its God in that center. Let us say that the union is like the joining of two wax candles to such an extent that the flame coming from them is but one, or that the wick, the flame, and the wax are all one. But afterward one candle can be easily separated from the other and there are two candles; the same holds for the wick. In the spiritual marriage the union is like what we have when rain falls from the sky into a river or fount; all is water, for the rain that fell from heaven cannot be divided or separated from the water of the river. Or it is like what we have when a little stream enters the sea, there is no means of separating the two. Or, like the bright light entering a room through two different windows; although the streams of light are separate when entering the room, they become one.
5. Perhaps this is what St. Paul means in saying He that is joined or united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him, and is referring to this sovereign marriage, presupposing that His Majesty has brought the soul to it through union. And he also says: For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. The soul as well, I think, can say these words now because this state is the place where the little butterfly we mentioned dies, and with the greatest joy because its life is now Christ.
6. And that its life is Christ is understood better, with the passing of time, by the effects this life has. Through some secret aspirations the soul understands clearly that",4,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,18,2,0,17,0,0,0,13,4,3,11,4,4,4,0,0,3,2,2
"329",1574,14,"it is God who gives life to our soul. These aspirations come very, very often in such a living way that they can in no way be doubted. The soul feels them very clearly even though they are indescribable. But the feeling is so powerful that sometimes the soul cannot avoid the loving expressions they cause, such as: O Life of my life! Sustenance that sustains me! and things of this sort. For from those divine breasts where it seems God is always sustaining the soul there flow streams of milk bringing comfort to all the people of the castle. It seems the Lord desires that in some manner these others in the castle may enjoy the great deal the soul is enjoying and that from that full-flowing river, where this tiny fount is swallowed up, a spurt of that water will sometimes be directed toward the sustenance of those who in corporeal things must serve these two who are wed. Just as a distracted person would feel this water if he were suddenly bathed in it, and would be unable to avoid feeling it, so are these operations recognized, and even with greater certitude. For just as a great gush of water could not reach us if it didn't have a source, as I have said, so it is understood clearly that there is Someone in the interior depths who shoots these arrows and gives life to this life, and that there is a Sun in the interior of the soul from which a brilliant light proceeds and is sent to the faculties. The soul, as I have said, does not move from that center nor is its peace lost; for the very One who gave peace to the apostles when they were together can give it to the soul.
7. It has occurred to me that this greeting of the Lord must have amounted to much more than is apparent from its sound. So, too, with the Lord's words to the glorious Magdalene that she go in peace. Since His words are effected in us as deeds, they must have worked in such a manner in those souls already disposed that everything corporeal in the soul was taken away and it was left in pure spirit. Thus the soul could be joined in this heavenly union with the uncreated Spirit. For it is very certain that in emptying ourselves of all that is creature and detaching ourselves from it for the love of God, the same Lord",4,3,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,2,2,1,0,22,0,6,15,4,0,2,9,5,10,12,12,0,3,4,1,6,2,5
"330",1574,15,"will fill us with Himself. And thus, while Jesus our Lord was once praying for His apostles -- I don't remember where -- He said that they were one with the Father and with Him, just as Jesus Christ our Lord is in the Father and the Father is in Him. I don't know what greater love there can be than this. And all of us are included here, for His Majesty said: I ask not only for them but for all those who also will believe in me; and He says: I am in them.
8. Oh, God help me, how true these words are! And how well they are understood by the soul who is in this prayer and sees for itself. How well we would all understand them if it were not for our own fault, since the words of Jesus Christ, our King and Lord, cannot fail. But since we fail by not disposing ourselves and turning away from all that can hinder this light, we do not see ourselves in this mirror that we contemplate, where our image is engraved.
9. Well, to return to what we were saying. The Lord puts the soul in this dwelling of His, which is the center of the soul itself. They say that the empyreal heaven where the Lord is does not move as do the other heavens; similarly, it seems, in the soul that enters here there are none of those movements that usually take place in the faculties and the imagination and do harm to the soul, nor do these stirrings take away its peace.
It seems I'm saying that when the soul reaches this state in which God grants it this favor, it is sure of its salvation and safe from falling again. I do not say such a thing, and wherever I so speak that it seems the soul is secure, this should be taken to mean as long as the divine Majesty keeps it in His hand and it does not offend Him. At least I know certainly that the soul doesn't consider itself safe even though it sees itself in this state and the state has lasted for some years. But it goes about with much greater fear than before, guarding itself from any small offense against God and with the strongest desires to serve Him, as will be said further on, and with habitual pain and confusion at seeing the little it can do and the great deal to which it is",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,27,0,10,17,3,2,2,13,6,4,8,7,5,9,1,1,1,1,0
"331",1574,16,"obliged. This pain is no small cross but a very great penance. For when this soul does penance, the delight will be greater in the measure that the penance is greater. The true penance comes when God takes away the soul's health and strength for doing penance. Even though I have mentioned elsewhere the great pain this lack causes, the pain is much more intense here. All these things must come to the soul from its roots, from where it is planted. The tree that is beside the running water is fresher and gives more fruit. What is there, then, to marvel at in the desires this soul has since its true spirit has become one with the heavenly water we mentioned?
10. Now then, to return to what I was saying, it should not be thought that the faculties, senses, and passions are always in this peace; the soul is, yes. But in those other dwelling places, times of war, trial, and fatigue are never lacking; however, they are such that they do not take the soul from its place and its peace; that is, as a rule.
This center of our soul, or this spirit, is something so difficult to explain, and even believe in, that I think, Sisters, I'll not give you the temptation to disbelieve what I say, for I do not know how to explain this center. That there are trials and sufferings and that at the same time the soul is in peace is a difficult thing to explain. I want to make one or more comparisons for you. Please God, I may be saying something through them; but if not, I know that I'm speaking the truth in what I say.
11. The King is in His palace and there are many wars in his kingdom and many painful things going on, but not on that account does he fail to be at his post. So here, even though in those other dwelling places there is much tumult and there are many poisonous creatures and the noise is heard, no one enters that center dwelling place and makes the soul leave. Nor do the things the soul hears make it leave; even though they cause it some pain, the suffering is not such as to disturb it and take away its peace. The passions are now conquered and have a fear of entering the center because they would go away from there more subdued.
Our entire body may ache; but if the head is sound,",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,19,1,19,15,5,3,4,10,9,9,9,8,0,9,0,2,9,2,3
"332",1574,17,"the head will not ache just because the body aches.
I am laughing to myself over these comparisons for they do not satisfy me, but I don't know any others. You may think what you want; what I have said is true.

CHAPTER 3
 
Deals with the wonderful effects of this prayer that was mentioned. It is necessary to pay attention and heed to these effects, for the difference between them and the previous ones is remarkable.
 
1. Now, then, we are saying that this little butterfly has already died, with supreme happiness for having found repose and because Christ lives in it. Let us see what life it lives, or how this life differs from the life it was living. For from the effects, we shall see if what was said is true. By what I can understood these effects are the following.
2. The first effect is a forgetfulness of self, for truly the soul, seemingly, no longer is, as was said. Everything is such that this soul doesn't know or recall that there will be heaven or life or honor for it, because it employs all it has in procuring the honor of God. It seems the words His Majesty spoke to her produced the deed in her. They were that she look after what is His and that He would look after what is hers. Thus, the soul doesn't worry about all that can happen. It experiences strange forgetfulness, for, as I say, seemingly the soul no longer is or would want to be anything in anything, except when it understands that there can come from itself something by which the glory and honor of God may increase even one degree. For this purpose the soul would very willingly lay down its life.
3. Don't think by this, daughters, that a person fails to remember to eat and sleep -- doing so is no small torment -- and to do all that he is obliged to in conformity with his state in life. We are speaking of interior matters, for there is little to say about exterior works. Rather, the soul's pain lies in seeing that what it can now do by its own efforts amounts to nothing. For no earthly thing would it fail to do all it can and understands to be for the service of our Lord.
4. The second effect is that the soul has a great desire to suffer, but not the kind of desire that disturbs it as previously. For the desire left",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,1,12,1,10,14,2,1,5,20,13,11,15,9,5,8,0,3,10,0,1
"333",1574,18,"in these souls that the will of God be done in them reaches such an extreme that they think everything His Majesty does it good. If he desires the soul to suffer, well and good; if not, it doesn't kill itself as it used to.
5. These souls also have a deep interior joy when they are persecuted, with much more peace than that mentioned, and without any hostile feelings toward those who do, or desire to do, them evil. On the contrary, such a soul gains a particular love for its persecutors, in such a way that if it sees these latter in some trial it feels compassion and would take on any burden to free them from their trial, and eagerly recommends them to God and would rejoice to lose the favors His Majesty grants it if He would bestow these same gifts on those others so that they wouldn't offend our Lord.
6. You have already seen the trials and afflictions these souls have experienced in order to die so as to enjoy our Lord. What surprises me most of all now is that they have just as great a desire to serve Him and that through them He be praised and that they may benefit some soul if they can. For not only do they not desire to die but they desire to live very many years suffering the greatest trials if through these they can help that the Lord be praised, even though in something very small. If they knew for certain that in leaving the body the soul would enjoy God, they wouldn't pay attention to that; nor do they think of the glory of the saints. They do not desire at that time to be in glory. Their glory lies in being able some way to help the Crucified, especially when they see He is so offended and that few there are who, detached from everything else, really look after His honor.
7. It is true that sometimes these things are forgotten, and the loving desires to enjoy God and leave this exile return, especially when the soul sees how little it serves Him. But soon it turns and looks within itself and at how continually it experiences His presence, and with that it is content and offers His Majesty the desire to live as the most costly offering it can give Him.
It has no more fear of death than it would of a gentle rapture. The fact is that He who gave those",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,19,4,11,26,1,6,3,6,3,22,18,6,6,0,2,1,0,1,0
"334",1574,19,"desires that were so excessive a torment, now gives these others. May He be always blessed and praised.
8. The desires these souls have are no longer for consolations or spiritual delights, since the Lord Himself is present with these souls and it is His Majesty who now lives. Clearly, His life was nothing but a continual torment, and He makes ours the same; at least with the desires, for in other things He leads us as the weak, although souls share much in His fortitude when He sees they have need of it.
There is great detachment from everything and a desire to be always either alone or occupied in something that will benefit some soul. There are no interior trials or feelings of dryness, but the soul lives with a remembrance and tender love of our Lord. It would never want to go without praising Him. When it becomes distracted the Lord Himself awakens it in the manner mentioned, for one sees most clearly that that impulse, or I don't know what to call the feeling, proceeds from the interior depths of the soul, as was said of the impulses in the previous dwelling place. Here, in this dwelling place, these impulses are experienced most gently, but they do not proceed from the mind or the memory, nor do they come from anything that would make one think the soul did something on its own. This experience is an ordinary and frequent one, for it has been observed carefully. Just as a fire does not shoot its flames downward but upward, however great a fire is enkindled, so one experiences here that this interior movement proceeds from the center of the soul and awakens the faculties.
9. Certainly, if there were no other gain in this way of prayer except to understand the particular care God has in communicating with us and beseeching us to remain with Him -- for this experience doesn't seem to be anything else -- it seems to me that all the trials endured for the sake of enjoying these touches of His love, so gentle and penetrating, would be well worthwhile.
This you will have experienced, Sisters. For I think that when one has reached the prayer of union the Lord goes about with this concern if we do not grow negligent in keeping His commandments. When this impulse comes to you, remember that it comes from this interior dwelling place where God is in our soul, and praise Him very much. For certainly that",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,22,0,6,21,4,0,1,12,4,11,17,9,2,1,6,0,3,2,0
"335",1574,20,"note or letter is His, written with intense love and in such a way that He wants you alone to understand it and what He asks of you in it. By no means should you fail to respond to His Majesty, even though you may be externally occupied or in conversation with some persons. For it will often happen that our Lord will want to grant you this secret favor in public, and it is very easy -- since the response is interior -- to do what I'm saying and make an act of love, or say what St. Paul said: Lord, what will You have me do? In many ways He will teach you there what will be pleasing to Him and the acceptable time. I think it is understood that He hears us, and this touch, which is so delicate, almost always disposes the soul to be able to do what was said with a resolute will.
10. The difference in this dwelling place is the one mentioned: There are almost never any experiences of dryness or interior disturbance of the kind that were present at times in all the other dwelling places, but the soul is almost always in quiet. There is no fear that this sublime favor can be counterfeited by the devil, but the soul is wholly sure that the favor comes from God; for, as I have said, the faculties and senses have nothing to do with what goes on in this dwelling place. His Majesty reveals Himself to the soul and brings it to Himself in that place where, in my opinion, the devil will not dare enter, nor will the Lord allow him to enter. Nor does the Lord in all the favors He grants the soul here, as I have said, receive any assistance from the soul itself, except what it has already done in surrendering itself totally to God.
11. Every way in which the Lord helps the soul here, and all He teaches it, takes place with such quiet and so noiselessly that, seemingly to me, the work resembles the building of Solomon's temple where no sound was heard. So in this temple of God, in this His dwelling place, He alone and the soul rejoice together in the deepest silence. There is no reason for the intellect to stir or seek anything, for the Lord who created it wishes to give it repose here and that through a small crevice it might observe what is taking place. At",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,0,21,0,11,14,6,0,3,11,6,4,17,10,0,12,2,0,0,2,0
"336",1574,21,"times this sight is lost and the other faculties do not allow the intellect to look, but this happens for only a very short time. In my opinion, the faculties are not lost here; they do not work, but remain as though in amazement.
12. I am amazed as well to see that when the soul arrives here all raptures are taken away. Only once in a while are they experienced and then without those transports and that flight of the spirit. They happen very rarely and almost never in public as they very often did before. Nor do the great occasions of devotion cause the soul concern as previously. Nor, if souls in this dwelling place see a devout image or hear a sermon -- previously it was almost as though they didn't hear it -- or music, are they worried as was the poor little butterfly that went about so apprehensive that everything frightened it and made it fly. Now the reason could be that in this dwelling place either the soul has found its repose, or has seen so much that nothing frightens it, or that it doesn't feel that solitude it did before since it enjoys such company. In sum, Sisters, I don't know what the cause may be. For when the Lord begins to show what there is in this dwelling place and to bring the soul there, this great weakness is taken away. The weakness was a severe trial for the soul and previously was not taken away. Perhaps the reason is that the Lord has now fortified, enlarged, and made the soul capable. Or it could be that His Majesty wished to make known publicly that which He did with these souls in secret for certain reasons He knows, for His judgments are beyond all that we can imagine here below.
13. These effects along with all the other good ones from the degrees of prayer we mentioned, are given by God when He brings the soul to Himself with this kiss sought by the bride, for I think this petition is here granted. Here an abundance of water is given to this deer that was wounded. Here one delights in God's tabernacle. Here the dove Noah sent out to see if the storm was over finds the olive branch as a sign of firm ground discovered amid the floods and tempests of this world. O Jesus! Who would know the many things there must be in Scripture to explain this peace of",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,2,0,1,18,0,12,13,7,0,2,16,11,7,13,7,7,3,1,0,3,1,1
"337",1574,22,"soul! My God, since You see how important it is for us, grant that Christians will seek it; and in Your mercy do not take it away from those to whom You have given it. For, in the end, people must always live with fear until You give them true peace and bring them there where that peace will be unending. I say ""true peace,"" not because this peace is not true but because the first war could return if we were to withdraw from God.
14. But what will these souls feel on seeing that they could lack so great a blessing? Seeing this makes them proceed more carefully and seek to draw strength from their weakness so as not to abandon through their own fault any opportunity to please God more. The more favored they are by His Majesty the more they are afraid and fearful of themselves. And since through His grandeurs they have come to a greater knowledge of their own miseries, and their sins become more serious to them, they often go about like the publican not daring to raise their eyes. At other times they go about desiring to die so as to be safe; although, with the love they have, soon they again want to live in order to serve Him, as we said. And in everything concerning themselves they trust in His mercy. Sometimes the many favors make them feel more annihilated, for they fear that just as a ship too heavily laden sinks to the bottom they will go down too.
15. I tell you, Sisters, that the cross is not wanting but it doesn't disquiet or make them lose peace. For the storms, like a wave, pass quickly. And the fair weather returns, because the presence of the Lord they experience makes them soon forget everything. May He be ever blessed and praised by all His creatures, amen.

CHAPTER 4
 
Concludes by explaining what she thinks our Lord's purpose is in granting such great favors to the soul and how it is necessary that Martha and Mary join together. This chapter is very beneficial.
 
1. You must not think, Sisters, that the effects I mentioned are always present in these souls. Hence where I remember, I say ""ordinarily."" For sometimes our Lord leaves these individuals in their natural state, and then it seems all the poisonous creatures from the outskirts and other dwelling places of this castle band together to take revenge for the time they were unable to have these",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,18,2,15,29,6,3,3,11,15,9,8,13,4,3,2,1,2,1,0
"338",1574,23,"souls under their control.
2. True, this natural state lasts only a short while, a day at most or a little more. And in this great disturbance, usually occasioned by some event, the soul's gain through the good company it is in becomes manifest. For the Lord gives the soul great stability and good resolutions not to deviate from His service in anything. But it seems this determination increases, and these souls do not deviate through even a very slight first movement. As I say this disturbance is rare, but our Lord does not want the soul to forget its being, so that, for one thing, it might always be humble; for another, that it might better understand the tremendous favor it receives, what it owes His Majesty, and that it might praise Him.
3. Nor should it pass through your minds that, since these souls have such determination and strong desires not to commit any imperfection for anything on earth, they fail to commit many imperfections, and even sins. Advertently, no; for the Lord must give souls such as these very particular help against such a thing. I mean venial sins, for from what these souls can understand they are free from mortal sins, although not immune. That they might have some sins they don't know about is no small torment to them. They also suffer torment in seeing souls go astray. Even though in some way they have great hope that they themselves will not be among these souls, they cannot help but fear when they recall some of those persons Scripture mentions who, it seems, were favored by the Lord, like Solomon, who communed so much with His Majesty, as I have said. The one among you who feels safest should fear more, for blessed is the man who fears the Lord, says David. May His Majesty protect us always. To beseech Him that we not offend Him is the greatest security we can have. May He be praised forever, amen.
4. It will be good, Sisters, to tell you the reason the Lord grants so many favors in this world. Although, if you have paid attention, you will have understood this in learning of their effects, I want to tell you again here lest someone think that the reason is solely for the sake of giving delight to these souls; that thought would be a serious error. His Majesty couldn't grant us a greater favor than to give us a life that would be an imitation of",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,3,25,1,13,25,5,1,2,20,5,11,21,7,1,3,1,0,2,0,0
"339",1574,24,"the life His beloved Son lived. Thus I hold for certain that these favors are meant to fortify our weakness, as I have said here at times, that we may be able to imitate Him in His great sufferings.
5. We have always seen that these who were closer to Christ our Lord were those with the greatest trials. Let us look at what His glorious Mother suffered and the glorious apostles. How do you think St. Paul could have suffered such very great trials? Through him we can see the effects visions and contemplation produce when from our Lord, and not from the imagination or the devil's deceit. Did St. Paul by chance hide himself in the enjoyment of these delights and not engage in anything else? You already see that he didn't have a day of rest, from what we can understand, and neither did he have any rest at night since it was then that he earned his livelihood. I like very much the account about St. Peter fleeing from prison and how our Lord appeared to him and told him ""I am on my way to Rome to be crucified again."" We never recite the office of this feast, where this account is, that I don't find particular consolation. How did this favor from the Lord impress St. Peter or what did he do? He went straight to his death. And it was no small mercy from the Lord that Peter found someone to provide him with death.
6. O my Sisters! How forgetful this soul, in which the Lord dwells in so particular a way, should be of its own rest, how little it should care for its honor, and how far it should be from wanting esteem in anything! For if it is with Him very much, as is right, it should think little about itself. All its concern is taken up with how to please Him more and how or where it will show Him the love it bears Him. This is the reason for prayer, my daughters, the purpose of this spiritual marriage: the birth always of good works, good works.
7. This is the true sign of a thing, or favor, being from God, as I have already told you. It benefits me little to be alone making acts of devotion to our Lord, proposing and promising to do wonders in His service, if I then go away and when the occasion offers itself do everything the opposite. I was wrong in",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,2,15,2,7,25,1,0,3,11,15,8,14,7,4,1,0,0,2,1,0
"340",1574,25,"saying it profits little, for everything having to do with God profits a great deal. And even though we are weak and do not carry out these resolutions afterward, sometimes His Majesty will give us the power to do so, even though, perhaps, doing so is burdensome to us, as is often true. Since He sees that a soul is very fainthearted He gives it a severe trial, truly against its will, and brings this soul out of the trial with profit. Afterward, since the soul understands this, the fear lessens and one can offer oneself more willingly to Him. I meant ""it benefits me little"" in comparison with how much greater the benefit is when our deeds conform with what we say in prayer; what cannot be done all at once can be done little by little. Let the soul bend its will if it wishes that prayer be beneficial to it, for within the corners of these little monasteries there will not be lacking many occasions for you to do so.
8. Keep in mind that I could not exaggerate the importance of this. Fix your eyes on the Crucified and everything will become small for you. If His Majesty showed us His love by means of such works and frightful torments, how is it you want to please Him only with words? Do you know what it means to be truly spiritual? It means becoming the slaves of God. Marked with His brand, which is that of the cross, spiritual persons, because now they have given Him their liberty, can be sold by Him as slaves of everyone, as He was. He doesn't thereby do them any harm or grant them a small favor. And if souls aren't determined about becoming His slaves, let them be convinced that they are not making much progress, for this whole building, as I have said, has humility as its foundation. If humility is not genuinely present, for your own sake the Lord will not construct a high building lest that building fall to the ground. Thus, Sisters, that you might build on good foundations, strive to be the least and the slaves of all, looking at how or where you can please and serve them. What you do in this matter you do more for yourself than for them and lay stones so firmly that the castle will not fall.
9. I repeat, it is necessary that your foundation consist of more than prayer and contemplation. If you do not",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,4,15,0,6,19,2,0,0,12,11,9,12,8,3,3,0,1,2,1,0
"341",1574,26,"strive for the virtues and practice them, you will always be dwarfs. And, please God, it will be only a matter of not growing, for you already know that whoever does not increase decreases. I hold that love, where present, cannot possibly be content with remaining always the same.
10. It will seem to you that I am speaking with those who are beginning and that after this beginner's stage souls can rest. I have already told you that the calm these souls have interiorly is for the sake of their having much less calm exteriorly and much less desire to have exterior calm. What, do you think, is the reason for those inspirations (or to put it better, aspirations) I mentioned, and those messages the soul sends from the interior center to the people at the top of the castle and to the dwelling places outside the center where it is? Is it so that those outside might fall asleep? No, absolutely not! That the faculties, senses, and all the corporeal will not be idle, the soul wages more war from the center than it did when it was outside suffering with them, for then it didn't understand the tremendous gain trials bring. Perhaps they were the means by which God brought it to the center, and the company it has gives it much greater strength then ever. For if here below, as David says, in the company of the saints we will become saints, there is no reason to doubt that, being united with the Strong One through so sovereign a union of spirit with spirit, fortitude will cling to such a soul; and so we shall understand what fortitude the saints had for suffering and dying.
11. It is very certain that from that fortitude which clings to it there the soul assists all those who are in the castle, and even the body itself which often, seemingly, does not feel the strength. But the soul is fortified by the strength it has from drinking wine in this wine cellar, where it Spouse has brought it and from where He doesn't allow it to leave; and strength flows back to the weak body, just as food placed in the stomach strengthens the head and the whole body. Thus the soul has its share of misfortune while it lives. However much it does, the interior strength increases and this, too, the war that it waged; for everything seems like a trifle to it. The great penances that many",3,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,1,15,3,7,19,2,2,2,14,4,2,10,8,0,2,1,6,1,1,4
"342",1574,27,"saints -- especially the glorious Magdalene, who had always been surrounded by so much luxury -- performed must have come from this center. Also that hunger which our Father Elijah had for the honor of his God and which St. Dominic and St. Francis had so as to draw souls to praise God. I tell you, though they were forgetful of themselves, their suffering must have been great.
12. This is what I want us to strive for, my Sisters; and let us desire and be occupied in prayer not for the sake of our enjoyment but so as to have this strength to serve. Let's refuse to take an unfamiliar path, for we shall get lost at the most opportune time. It would indeed be novel to think of having these favors from God through a path other than the one He took and the one followed by all His saints. May the thought never enter our minds. Believe me, Martha and Mary must join together in order to show hospitality to the Lord and have Him always present and not host Him badly by failing to give Him something to eat. How would Mary, always seated at His feet, provide Him with food if her sister did not help her? His food is that in every way possible we draw souls that they may be saved and praise Him always.
13. You will make two objections: one, that He said that Mary had chosen the better part. The answer is that she had already performed the task of Martha, pleasing the Lord by washing His feet and drying them them her hair. Do you think it would be a small mortification for a woman of nobility like her to wander through these streets (and perhaps alone because her fervent love made her unaware of what she was doing) and enter a house she had never entered before and afterward suffer the criticism of the Pharisee and the very many other things she must have suffered? The people saw a woman like her change so much -- and, as we know, she was among such malicious people -- and they saw her friendship with the Lord whom they vehemently abhorred, and that she wanted to become a saint since obviously she would have changed her manner of dress and everything else. All of that was enough to cause them to comment on the life she had formerly lived. If nowadays there is so much gossip against persons who are",1,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,14,0,8,15,0,1,6,8,8,13,8,16,2,1,2,3,2,1,4
"343",1574,28,"not so notorious; what would have been said then? I tell you, Sisters, the better part came after many trials and much mortification, for even if there were no other trial than to see His Majesty abhorred, that would be an intolerable one. Moreover, the many trials that afterward she suffered at the death of the Lord and in the years that she subsequently lived in His absence must have been a terrible torment. You see she wasn't always in the delight of contemplation at the feet of the Lord.
14. The other objection you will make is that you are unable to bring souls to God, that you do not have the means; that you would do it willingly but that not being teachers or preachers, as were the apostles, you do not know how. This objection I have answered at times in writing, but I don't know if I did so in this Castle. Yet since the matter is something I believe is passing through your minds on account of the desires God gives you I will not fail to respond here. I already told you elsewhere that sometimes the devil gives us great desires so that we will avoid setting ourselves to the task at hand, serving our Lord in possible things, and instead be content with having desired the impossible. Apart from the fact that by prayer you will be helping greatly, you need not be desiring to benefit the whole world but must concentrate on those who are in your company, and thus your deed will be greater since you are more obliged toward them. Do you think such deep humility, your mortification, service of all and great charity toward them, and love of the Lord is of little benefit? This fire of love in you enkindles their souls, and with every other virtue you will be always awakening them. Such service will not be small but very great and very pleasing to the Lord. By what you do in deed -- that which you can -- His Majesty will understand that you would do much more. Thus He will give you the reward He would if you had gained many souls for Him.
15. You will say that such service does not convert souls because all the Sisters you deal with are already good. Who has appointed you judge in this matter? The better they are the more pleasing their praises will be to our Lord and the more their prayer will profit their",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,3,17,1,5,19,1,0,2,9,7,16,7,8,2,2,2,2,0,2,0
"344",1574,29,"neighbor.
In sum, Sisters, what I conclude with is that we shouldn't build castles in the air. The Lord doesn't look so much at the greatness of our works as at the love with which they are done. And if we do what we can, His Majesty will enable us each day to do more and more, provided that we do not quickly tire. But during the little while this life lasts -- and perhaps it will last a shorter time than each one thinks -- let us offer the Lord interiorly and exteriorly the sacrifice we can. His Majesty will join it with that which He offered on the cross to the Father for us. Thus even though our works are small they will have the value our love for Him would have merited had they been great.
16. May it please His Majesty, my Sisters and daughters, that we all reach that place where we may ever praise Him. Through the merits of His Son who lives and reigns forever and ever, may He give me the grace to carry out something of what I tell you, amen. For I tell you that my confusion is great, and thus I ask you through the same Lord that in your prayers you do not forget this poor wretch. CHAPTER 20
 
Treats of the foundation of the monastery, Our Lady of the Annunciation, in Alba de Tormes. It was made in the year 1571.
 
1. Two months had not yet passed since the feast of All Saints (the day on which possession was taken of the house in Salamanca) when I received an urgent request from the administrator for the Duke of Alba and his wife that a monastery be founded in the town of Alba. I was not too keen about the idea because the town was a small one, which would make it necessary for us to have an income, and my inclination was not to have one. Father Master Fray Domingo Báñez (who had been my confessor, whom I consulted when beginning these foundations) happened to be in Salamanca, and he reprimanded me and told me that since the Council had given permission it would not be right to forego the foundation of a monastery because of a need for an income. He said further that I failed to understand that whether the monaster y had an income or not made little difference in regard to nuns being poor and very perfect.
Before I say more, I shall",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,2,6,14,0,2,12,1,0,1,5,14,6,8,7,1,2,0,0,2,2,0
"345",1574,30,"mention who the foundress was and how the Lord moved her to make the foundation.
2. The foundress of the monastery, Our Lady of the Annunciation, was Teresa de Layz, a daughter of noble parents, hidalgos of pure blood. Since her parents were not as rich as would be expected considering the nobility of their lineage, they had their house in a place called Tordillos, which is two leagues from the said town of Alba. It is a great pity that the world is so influenced by vanity that people would prefer to remain in these little villages where there is a lack of Christian doctrine and of many other things that are means to the enlightenment of souls, than to fail even one iota in those punctilios that accompany what they call honor. Since the parents already had four daughters when Teresa de Layz was born, they were much distressed to see that she also was a daughter.
3. Certainly, it is something to be much wept over that human beings do not know what is best for them and are totally ignorant of the judgments of God and of the great blessings that can come to them through daughters or of the great sufferings that can come from sons. It doesn't seem they want to leave this matter to the One who creates their children and understands everything, but they kill themselves over what should be making them happy. As people whose faith is asleep, they do not reflect or recall that it is God who thus ordains, and so they do not leave everything in His hands. And being so blind that they do not do this, they suffer great ignorance in not understanding how little these afflictions help them. Oh, God help me! How differently will we understand these ignorances on the day when the truth about all things shall be understood. And how many fathers and mothers will be seen going to hell because they had sons and also how many will be seen in heaven because of their daughters.
4. Well, to return to what I was saying, things came to the point that on the third day after her birth they left their baby girl alone and forgot about her for the entire day, from morning until night, as though she mattered little to them. One thing they had done well was to have her baptized by a priest as soon as she was born. When at night, a woman came who was taking",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,13,1,12,16,1,2,5,12,15,7,4,8,4,2,1,3,1,0,0
"346",1574,31,"care of the baby and knew what was going on, she hastened to see if the child was dead. Some other persons who had gone there to visit the mother were also witnesses to what I shall now tell. Weeping, the woman took the baby into her arms and complaining of the cruelty said: ""How is it, my daughter, are you not a Christian?"" The baby girl lifted her head and answered, ""Yes, I am,"" and spoke no more until reaching that age at which all children begin to speak. Those who heard her were amazed, and her mother began to love and cherish her from then on, and she often said that she would like to live to see what God would do with this child. She reared her daughter in keeping with high moral standards and taught her everything about virtue.
5. When the time came that her parents wanted her to marry, she refused, nor did she have any desire at all to get married. She happened to find out that Francisco Valazquez, now her husband, who is also the founder of this house, was seeking her. In hearing his name, she decided to marry if she could marry him, never having seen him in her life. But His Majesty saw that this was fitting so that the good work both of them did in order to serve Him could be done. Besides being a virtuous and rich man, Francisco Velázquez loves his wife so much that he seeks to please her in everything. And rightly so, for all that one can seek in a married woman the Lord gave to him in great abundance. Along with the diligent care she takes of her household, her goodness is so great that when her husband brought her to his native town of Alba and the duke's housing administrators happened to arrange that lodging be given in her house to a young gentleman, she was very upset and began to abhor the town.
For being youthful and attractive in appearance, she could have been the victim of some evil deed since the devil began to put bad thoughts in that gentleman's mind.
6. Aware of this, but without saying anything to her husband, she asked him to take her away from there. He did so and brought her to Salamanca where she lived very happily, surrounded by much of the world's goods, since he held a position that made others want to please and flatter him. They had but one",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,1,5,1,8,19,1,3,1,6,5,11,7,6,4,7,0,2,1,2,0
"347",1574,32,"sorrow, that God had not given them children. That He might give them, she offered many devotions and prayers. And she never begged the Lord for anything else but that He give her offspring so that after her death her children could continue the praise of His Majesty, for it seemed to her unfortunate that this praise would end with her and that there would be no one after her days to praise Him. And she told me that there wasn't any other desire that came to her mind. And she is a woman who is so truthful and good a Christian and virtuous, as I have said, that it often makes me praise our Lord to see her works and her great desires never to fail to use her time well and to please Him always.
7. Well, then, living many years with this desire and recommending it to St. Andrew, who, she was informed, is a patron of such causes, and after many other devotions that she had offered, she was told one night while lying down: ""Do not desire children, for you will be condemned."" She was left frightened and fearful. But not for this reason did the desire leave her, for it seemed to her that since her purpose was so good there would be no reason for her to be condemned. So she continued to beg our Lord. Especially, she carried out a particular devotion to St. Andrew. Once, while experiencing this desire, though she doesn't know whether she was awake or asleep (whatever may be the case, it is clear that the vision was true from what followed), it seemed to her that she was in a house where on the patio beneath the gallery was a well. And she saw in that place a green meadow with white flowers, so beautiful she wouldn't be able to describe what she saw. Near the well, St. Andrew appeared in the form of a very venerable and handsome person, for it gave her great delight to look on him, and he said to her: ""These are children other than those you desire."" She did not want the great consolation she felt in that place to end; but it did not last. And she understood clearly that the vision was of St. Andrew, without anyone telling her; and also that our Lord willed that she found a monastery. Hence it can be understood that the vision was an intellectual as well as an imaginative one, nor",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,12,1,6,25,2,1,2,12,8,13,11,7,7,2,1,1,1,0,0
"348",1574,33,"could it have been either a whim or an illusion caused by the devil.
8. First, the vision was not a whim; this can be deduced from its great effect, for from that point on she never more desired children. She remained so convinced in her heart that this was God's will that she no longer asked for or desired them. Thus she began to think about the way in which she could do what the Lord wanted. Nor was it an illusion caused by the devil. This can be discerned from the fact that a monastery is now founded where our Lord is much served, for the devil of himself cannot do good. In addition, this took place more than six years before the monastery was founded, and the devil cannot know the future.
9. Very surprised by this vision, she told her husband that since God did not desire to give them children they should found a monastery of nuns. Being so good and loving her so much, he husband was happy with the idea and began to consider where they might found one. She wanted it in the town where she had been born. He put up legitimate objections to convince her that her own town would not be a good place for it.
10. While they were discussing this, the Duchess of Alba called for him. When he arrived, she ordered him to return to Alba to undertake duties in her house, and he accepted the office even though it was a less important one than the office he had held in Salamanca. When his wife heard about it, she was very distressed because, as I said, she abhorred Alba. Being assured by her husband that they would not accept guests any more, she was somewhat appeased; although she was still very troubled since Salamanca was more to her liking. He bought a house and sent for her. She came with great weariness and felt wearier when she saw the house. For although the location was very good and the property extensive, the house did not have enough rooms; thus she was very troubled that night. The next morning, when she walked onto the patio, she saw on the same side the well where she had seen St. Andrew. And she saw everything else, no more nor less than what had been shown to her -- I mean the place, not the saint or the flowers or the meadow, although she did have and still has them",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,1,13,0,7,17,1,0,0,13,11,10,7,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0
"349",1574,34,"well imprinted in her imagination.
11. When she saw these things, she became troubled and resolved to found the monastery there. She did this now with great consolation and tranquility, without wanting to go somewhere else, and they began to buy more houses nearby until they had ample land. She was concerned about which order they would ask, for she wanted the nuns to be few and strictly enclosed. In discussing the matter with two religious from different orders, who were very good and learned men, she was told by both that it would be better to do some other good works because nuns are usually unhappy. And she was told many other things, for since the project saddened the devil he wanted to prevent it, and thus he made them think that the reasons they gave her were very sound. Since they presented so many as to why it wouldn't be good, and the devil presented more in order to hinder it, she became fearful and disturbed and decided not to go ahead. This she told to her husband, and the two of them felt that since such men had told her that it would not be good and her intention was to serve our Lord they should forget about it. Thus they agreed to arrange for a marriage between a niece on her husband's side and a nephew of hers, who was very virtuous and still young and whom she loved very much, and give them a great part of their estate, keeping the rest for their own spiritual well-being. They were both left feeling certain and serene about this decision.
12. But since our Lord had ordained something else, their agreement was of little benefit. In less than fifteen days, the nephew became so seriously ill that within a very few days our Lord brought him to Himself. She became so convinced that the cause of her nephew's death had been her decision to set aside what God wanted her to do, in order to leave the estate to him, that she felt great fear. She recalled what happened to Jonah the prophet for not having wanted to obey God, and it seemed to her that God had punished her by taking away that nephew whom she loved so much. From that day on she was determined not to let anything make her fail to found the monastery, and her husband was also; although they didn't know how to go about it. It seemed to her that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,15,1,11,20,3,1,3,22,15,10,7,1,1,1,3,0,1,2,0
"350",1574,35,"God had put into her heart what has now been accomplished. Those whom she told about the monastery, and to whom she described how she wanted it, laughed over the matter since they thought she would not find the things she was looking for; this was true especially of a confessor of hers, a Franciscan friar, a distinguished man of learning. She was very dejected.
13. At that time, this friar happened to go to a certain town where he was told about these monasteries of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel that were now being founded. Very well informed about them, he returned and told her he had now discovered how she could found the monastery she desired. He told what had happened and that she should try to speak with me about it. This she did. We underwent much difficulty in trying to come to an agreement. For in the case of monasteries founded with an income, my goal always was that they have enough to keep the nuns from dependence on relatives, or on anyone, and that food and clothing and everything necessary be given to them in the house, and that the sick be very well cared for. For when necessities are lacking, many troubles arise. In founding many monasteries in poverty, without an income, I never lack courage or confidence; I am certain that God will not fail them. In founding them with an income that is small, everything fails me; I find it better that they not be founded.
14. She and her husband finally became reasonable and offered enough revenue to provide for the number of nuns. And what I highly appreciated, they left their own house in order to give it to us and moved into one that was in a dilapidated condition. The Blessed Sacrament was reserved and the foundation was made on the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul, in the year 1571, for the glory and honor of God. In this foundation, in my opinion, His Majesty is very much served. May it please Him to protect it always.
15. I began to say some particular things about some of the Sisters in these monasteries thinking that when this would be read those now living in them would not be alive and that those who come after would be inspired to carry on in the tradition of such a good beginning. Afterward, it has seemed to me, there will be someone who will tell these things better and in more",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,2,5,13,1,5,19,0,0,2,15,10,10,9,10,1,2,0,1,4,0,1
"351",1574,36,"detail and without having the fear that I have had of giving the impression of being partial. And so I have left out many things considered miraculous by those who had seen or known of them, for such things are supernatural. I have not wanted to say anything about them or of what our Lord has been clearly seen to do through the nuns' prayers.
In the account of the dates on which these monasteries were founded I suspect that I am sometimes mistaken, although I try diligently to remember. Since these dates are not of great importance, because they can be corrected afterward, I put them down according to what I can remember; it makes little difference if there is some error.

CHAPTER 21
 
Treats of the foundation in Segovia of the Carmel of the glorious St. Joseph. It was founded on the very feast of St. Joseph in 1574.
 
1. I have already mentioned how after I founded the monasteries of Salamanca and Alba and before we had our own house in Salamanca, the Father Maestro Fray Pedro Fernández, who was then the apostolic commissary, ordered me to go to the Incarnation in Avila for three years. I also mentioned that when he saw the need of the nuns in Salamanca for a house, he ordered me to go there so that they could move into one of their own. One day while I was there in prayer, our Lord told me to go to Segovia and make a foundation. This seemed impossible to me, for I could not go unless ordered to do so, and I had learned from the apostolic commissary, the Father Maestro Fray Pedro Fernández, that he did not want me to make any more foundations. I also saw clearly that since the three years I was to stay in the Incarnation were not over, he had great reason for not wanting any more foundations. While I was thinking about this, the Lord told me to tell him and that He Himself would bring this foundation about.
2. At the time, I was in Salamanca. From there I wrote to His Paternity reminding him that he already knew I had a command from our most Reverend Father General to make a foundation when I saw that there was an opportunity for doing so. I mentioned that one of these monasteries had been accepted in Segovia by both the city and the bishop, that if His Paternity would give the order I would found it, that",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,1,11,0,2,8,1,0,0,12,18,13,11,3,5,1,0,0,0,0,0
"352",1574,37,"I was pointing this out to him to satisfy my conscience, and that I would feel confident and content with whatever he ordered. I believe these were the words, more or less, and I added that it seemed to me the monastery would render service to God. I think, indeed, that His Majesty wanted it, because the apostolic commissary said immediately that I should found it, and he gave me permission. From what I had known about him in regard to these matters, I was very much amazed. And from Salamanca I arranged that they rent me a house, for after the experience in Toledo and Valladolid I had learned that it was better to rent a house and take possession first and then look for one to buy. This was so for many reason, the principal one being that I didn't have a cent to buy one with. Once the monastery was founded, the Lord would then provide; also, a more appropriate site could be chosen.
3. There was a lady there who had been the wife of the owner of an entailed estate. Her name was Doña Ana de Jimena. She had once come to see me in Avila. She was a good servant of God, and her calling had always been to be a nun. Thus after the founding of the monastery, she and one of her daughters, who was living a devout life, entered it. And the Lord took away the unhappiness she had experienced both while married and as a widow and gave her a double measure of happiness in the religious life. Both mother and daughter had always been very recollected and faithful servants of God.
4. This good lady acquired the house and provided for everything she saw we needed, both for the church and for ourselves. As a result, I had little work to do. But there is never a foundation in which there is not some trial. And the trial came in addition to the fact that I went there while suffering from a high fever and nausea, and from interior ills of very great dryness and darkness of soul, and from bodily complaints of many kinds, the intensity of which lasted three months. And for the half year that I was there, I was always sick.
5. On the feast of St. Joseph, we reserved the Blessed Sacrament. Although we had permission from both the bishop and the city, I did not want to enter except on the eve of the",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,5,5,15,0,3,10,0,0,2,9,6,8,3,8,3,1,2,1,6,0,0
"353",1574,38,"feast, secretly, and at night. Much time had passed since the permission had been given, but because I had been at the Incarnation and did not have our Father General for superior, but someone else, I had not been able to make the foundation. The permission I had received from the bishop of the place -- when he agreed -- was in word. He gave it through a gentleman named Andrés de Jimena who was looking for a house for us. But this gentleman didn't bother about getting the permission in writing, nor did this seem to me to matter. I was mistaken, for when the vicar general learned that the monastery had been founded, he came at once, very angry, and did not allow Mass to be said any more and wanted to take prisoner the one who said it, a discalced friar, who came with both Father Julián de Avila and another servant of God, who came with me, named Antonio Gaytán.
6. This latter was a gentleman from Alba. He was called by the Lord some years before while very much involved in the world. He so trampled it under foot that all he thought about was how to serve the Lord more. In the foundations that will be dealt with from here on, mention will have to be made of him, for he helped me much and did a great deal of work for me. I have told who he is, and if I should have to tell of his virtues, I would not finish very quickly. What mattered most to us was that he was so mortified, for there was no servant from among those who came with us who was as ready as he was to do all the necessary things. He is a man of deep prayer, and God has granted him so many favors that everything others would consider a burden made him happy and was easy for him to accept. This is the way he is in all the work that he has done for these foundations. For it indeed seems that God called both him and Father Julián de Avila for this purpose, although Father Julián de Avila was with us from the first foundation. By giving me company like this, our Lord must have desired that everything turn out well for me. It was Father Julián's characteristic while traveling to speak of God and to teach those who traveled with us or whom we met, and thus in",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,1,0,10,0,4,12,0,2,0,6,14,8,8,8,1,3,0,1,0,0,0
"354",1574,39,"every way he served His Majesty.
7. It is only right, my daughters, that those of you who read these foundations should know what you owe to these two (for without any self-interest they labored so much for this good that you enjoy, of being in these monasteries) in order that you might recommended them to our Lord and they might receive some benefit from your prayers. For if you knew the bad nights and days they suffered, and the trials on the roads, you would do so very willingly.
8. The vicar general did not want to go away without leaving a guard at the door of the church. I don't know why; it served to frighten a little those who were there. As for me, I was never much bothered by what happened once possession of the foundation had taken place; all my fears came before. I sent for some persons, relatives of a companion I brought from among my sisters, who were renowned in that place that they might speak to the vicar general and explain to him that I had permission from the bishop. He knew this very well, as he said afterward, but he thought we should have informed him. I believe that had we done so, things would have been much worse. Finally, they got him to agree to let us stay in the monastery, but he removed the Blessed Sacrament. This didn't matter to us. We remained thus for some months until a house was bought; along with it came many lawsuits. We had lawsuits with the Mercedarians and, because the house had an annuity attached to it, with the cathedral chapter. Before this we had many difficulties with the Franciscan friars because of a house we tried to buy near them.
9. O Jesus! What a trial it is to have to contend with many opinions. When the litigation would seem to be over, it would begin anew because it wasn't enough to give them what they asked for; there was at once some other difficulty. Explained in this way, it all seems like nothing; but going through it was much different.
10. A nephew of the bishop did all that he could for us, for he was the prior and canon of that church; and so, too, did the licentiate Herrera, a very great servant of God. Finally, after we gave much money, the lawsuit came to an end. We were left with the lawsuit of the Mercedarians, for in order to move",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,4,4,11,0,8,8,2,1,1,11,7,9,11,5,0,2,0,0,0,0,0
"355",1574,40,"to the new house great secrecy was necessary. When they found out that we were there, for we had moved a day or two before the feast of St. Michael, they thought it would be good to settle for a sum of money. The greatest suffering that these obstacles caused me was that in no more than seven or eight days my three years as prioress at the Incarnation were to come to an end, and I necessarily had to be there.
11. Our Lord was pleased that everything should turn out so well that no contention remained, and within two or three days I was at the Incarnation. May His name be ever blessed who has always granted me so many favors, and may all creatures praise Him. Amen.

CHAPTER 22
 
Treats of the foundation named after the glorious St. Joseph of the Savior and made in the town of Beas on the feast of St. Matthias in the year 1575.
 
1. When I was sent, as mentioned, from the Incarnation to Salamanca, a messenger came there from the town of Beas with letters for me from a lady in that area and from the curate beneficiary there. The letters contained both the offer of a benefice from that town and requests from other persons asking me to come and found a monastery. They already had a house; all that was needed was to go and make the foundation.
2. When questioned by me, the man recounted wonderful things about the land, and rightly so, for it is very delightful and has a good climate. But in considering the distance, many leagues from here, the notion of making a foundation there seemed to me foolish. Especially so, since I was under the orders of the apostolic commissary, who, as I mentioned, was opposed to, or at least not in favor of, my making foundations. So I wanted to answer that I was unable, and avoid asking permission of the apostolic commissary about it. Afterward, it seemed to me that since he was present at that time in Salamanca and I had received the order from our Reverend Father General not to fail to make foundations, it would be unwise to refuse without getting his opinion.
3. When he saw the letters brought to me by the messenger, he sent word that he didn't think it would be good to disappoint them, that he had been edified by their devotion, that I should write telling them that when they had permission from",2,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,1,5,0,5,16,1,0,3,9,13,7,10,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"356",1574,41,"the Order of Knights of that town, provisions would be made for the foundation. He was certain that the council of the Order of Knights would not give the permission, for he had known from elsewhere that in many years no one had been able to receive such a permission from it, and he did not want my answer to sound like a refusal. Sometimes I think about this and how that which our Lord wants, even though we may not want it, comes about in such a way that without our being aware we are the instruments of it. In this case the instrument was the Father Maestro Fray Pedro Fernández, who was the commissary. And so when they received the permission from the council, he couldn't refuse. The foundation was made in this way.
4. This monastery of the blessed St. Joseph was founded in the town of Beas on the feast of St. Matthias in the year 1575. It came about for the honor and glory of God in the following way.
There was in this town a gentleman named Sancho Rodríguez de Sandoval, of noble lineage and having many temporal possessions. He was married to a lady named Doña Catalina Godínez. Among the children that our Lord gave them were two daughters, those who founded this monastery. The older was fourteen when our Lord called her to His service. Up to this age she was far from ready to leave the world; on the contrary, she had such a high estimation of herself that all that her father sought for her in marriages seemed of small account.
5. One day while in a room next to the one in which her father was lying down, she happened to read on a crucifix the inscription that is placed over the cross. Suddenly when she read it, the Lord worked a complete change in her: She had been thinking of a marriage that was being sought for her, which was better than she could have hoped for, and saying to herself: ""With what little my father is content, that I become connected with an entailed estate; I am thinking of becoming the origin of a new line of descendants."" She was not inclined toward marriage, for she considered it demeaning to be subject to someone; nor did she know where this pride came from. The Lord knew how it could be remedied. Blessed be His mercy.
6. The moment she read the inscription, it seemed to her that just as",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,3,1,1,13,0,1,10,0,1,0,13,10,9,7,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0
"357",1574,42,"sunshine enters a dark room, a light came into her soul by which she understood the truth. With this light she set her eyes on the Lord who was on the cross shedding blood, and she thought about how badly He was treated and of His great humility and about how different the road of pride was that she was following. There must have been some space of time in which the Lord suspended her. There His Majesty gave her a deep knowledge of her own misery, and she desired that all might know of it. He gave her so great a desire to suffer for God that all that the martyrs suffered she desired to suffer with them. She experienced such profound humiliation and self-abhorrence that were it not an offense against God, she would have wanted to be a very dissolute woman so that all might abhor her. Thus she began to despise herself with great desires for penance, which afterward she put into effect. She at once promised chastity and poverty and wanted to see herself so subject that she would have rejoiced to be carried off then to the land of the Moors and remain there. All of these virtues lasted in her in such a way that the experience was clearly seen to be a supernatural favor from our Lord, as will be said later, so that all might praise Him.
7. May You be blessed forever and ever, my God, for within a moment You undo a soul and remake it. What is this, Lord? I would want to ask here what the apostles asked You when You cured the blind man, whether it was his parents who had sinned. I mean, who could have merited so sublime a favor? She certainly did not, for it was already mentioned what thoughts You took away from her when You granted that favor. Oh, great are Your judgments, Lord! You know what You are doing, but I do not know what I am saying since Your works and judgments are in incomprehensible. May You be ever glorified, for You have the power to do even more. What would become of me if this were not so? But, did the merit in some way come from her mother? For so great was her mother's practice of Christianity that it would be possible that Your goodness, being merciful, would desire that she see within her lifetime this great virtue in her daughters. Sometimes I think You grant",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,1,16,0,7,22,2,3,4,11,5,18,10,12,6,2,0,2,1,0,0
"358",1574,43,"similar favors to those who love You, and You do them so much good that You give them that by which they may serve You.
8. While she was in this state, such a loud noise came from the room above that it seemed everything was falling down. It seemed that all of that noise was coming down in the corner where she was, and she heard some roars that lasted quite a while. They were such that her father who although he had not yet got up, as was mentioned, became so frightened he began to tremble. As though beside himself, he took a robe and his sword and entered there and very much shaken asked her what that noise was. She told him that she hadn't seen anything. He looked in the next room further and since he saw nothing told her to go stay with her mother and informed her mother about what he had heard and not to let their daughter be alone.
9. This indeed explains what the devil must feel when he sees a soul already considered to be his own loosed from his power. Since he is so hostile toward what is good for us, I am not surprised that in seeing our merciful Lord grant so many favors all at once he should become frightened and make such a show of his feeling. This was especially so, because he understood that on account of the riches that were left in that soul he had to remain without any that could be considered his. For I hold that our Lord never grants so great a favor to a person without allowing others to share in it as well. She never said anything about this. But she was left with the strongest desire to embrace religious life and frequently sought permission from her parents to do so. They would never give their consent.
10. After three years had gone by in which she frequently sought permission, she began, on the feast of St. Joseph, to dress in a simple manner since she saw that they did not want her to be a religious. She told only her mother from whom it would have been easy to obtain the permission to be a nun. As for her father, she did not dare ask, but she went to the church so that once the townspeople had seen her in this dress, she could be sure her parents would not take it away. And this is what happened,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,10,0,7,14,4,1,1,11,6,9,8,9,7,7,3,0,1,1,0
"359",1574,44,"for they let the matter go. During those three years, she observed hours of prayer and mortified herself in every way she could, for the Lord taught her. She used to enter the courtyard and throw water on her face and then expose it to the sun so that because of the resulting ugly appearance her parents would give up the idea of a marriage for her, for she was still being urged to marry.
11. She no longer had any desire to give orders to anyone. Since she had charge of her father's house, it happened that when she realized that she had given orders to the housemaids, for she couldn't do otherwise, she would wait until they were asleep and kiss their feet, anxious because they, though better than she, were serving her. Since during the day she was busy with her parents, when it was time for sleep, she would spend the whole night in prayer. Thus, she often went with so little sleep that it would have been impossible for her to do so without supernatural aid. The penance and the disciplines were many because she had no one to guide her nor did she speak with anyone. Among other things, one Lent she wore her father's coat of mail next to her flesh. She used to go to a secluded place to pray, where the devil heaped ridicule on her. Often she began prayer at ten at night and was absorbed in it until daylight.
12. She spent about four years in these exercises. Then, desiring that she serve Him through other greater ones the Lord gave her most serious and painful illnesses. Thus she suffered from continual fever, dropsy, heart trouble, and a breast tumor which was removed. In sum, these illnesses lasted almost seventeen years; there were but few days in which she felt well. Five years after she had received the above favor from God, her father died. Her sister, when fourteen (one year after Doña Catalina had made this change) also put on a simple garb, for she had been fond of fine clothes, and began as well to practice prayer. Her mother helped them in all their good practices and desires. She thought that it was good for them to become occupied in a very virtuous work, one that was far out of harmony with their status: teaching girls needlework and reading, without any fee, but only for the opportunity to instruct the girls in prayer and doctrine. Their work",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,2,3,11,1,8,12,1,2,1,5,12,10,8,2,0,2,1,9,6,2,1
"360",1574,45,"was very fruitful because many girls were helped, and even now the good habits these girls learned when small are visible. The good work didn't continue for long because the devil, saddened by it, made the parents of the little girls feel that it was an affront for their daughters to be taught free of charge. This along with the beginning of the illnesses that afflicted her caused her to discontinue the work.
13. Five years after the father of these young ladies died, their mother died. Doña Catalina had always felt called to be a nun, but she could not get her parents' consent. She now wanted to go away at once to be a nun. Since there was no monastery in Beas, her relatives counselled her that since they had the sufficient means they should strive to found a monastery in their own town, that this would be of greater service to our Lord. Since the town is a commandery of the Order of the Knights of Santiago, permission was necessary from the council of this order, and so she diligently sought to obtain it.
14. It was so difficult to obtain that they spent four years in which they underwent many trials and expenses; and until a petition was sent to the king himself, nothing proved helpful. And it happened that because the difficulty became so great, her relatives began to tell her that the idea was foolish and that she should forget about it. Since she was almost always in bed with such serious illnesses, as was mentioned, they said that no monastery would accept her as a nun. She answered that if within a month our Lord gave her health they should understand thereby that He would be served by the monastery and that she would go to the royal court herself to obtain the license. When she said this, it had been more than half a year that she had not got out of bed; and for almost eight years she had hardly moved from it. During those eight years she suffered from a continual fever, consumption, tuberculosis, dropsy, and an inflammation of the liver. This latter could be felt, and it so burned that even her clothes were affected by it and her chemise scorched. This seems incredible, and I myself inquired of the doctor about these illnesses that she had at that time, for I was amazed. She also suffered from gout and sciatica.
15. On the eve of the feast of St.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,8,0,2,3,10,2,8,7,0,0,3,14,10,11,5,4,0,2,3,2,7,0,1
"361",1574,46,"Sebastian, which was a Saturday, our Lord gave her such complete health that she didn't know how to conceal it and prevent the miracle from being known. She says that when our Lord desired to cure her He gave her an interior trembling that made her sister think that her life was coming to an end. And she saw within herself the greatest change, and in her soul, she says, she felt another change which was beneficial to her. Because of her health she was able to attend to the business of the monastery, and this made her happier than did her feeling of good health. From the beginning when God called her, He gave an abhorrence of self, for she made little of all. She says she was left with so powerful a desire to suffer that she begged God earnestly to exercise her in suffering in every way.
16. His Majesty did not fail to fulfill this desire. During those eight years they bled her more than five hundred times, without counting the many cuppings; the body shows them clearly. They put salt in the wounds, for the doctor said it was good for drawing the poison from a sore of her side; they did this more than twenty times. What is more amazing is that as soon as she was told that the doctor prescribed one of these remedies, she fearlessly longed for the time to come in which they would carry it out, and she encouraged the doctors to apply the cauteries, which were used often for a breast cancer and other purposes. She says that what made her want this was the desire to prove whether or not the longings she had for martyrdom were authentic.
17. Since she found that she had suddenly become well she discussed with both her confessor and doctor the possibility of being brought to another town so that they could say the change of environment had caused the cure. They did not want to do so; on the contrary, they spread the news. They had already judged her to be incurable because the blood she was spitting up was so putrefied that they said it contained part of the lungs. She remained in bed for three days, not daring to get up lest the miracles of her health become known. But since it could be no more disguised than could her illness, the attempt to hide it was of little benefit.
18. She told me that the previous August while",2,5,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,7,2,1,1,7,0,6,10,1,1,4,11,15,10,3,5,1,7,2,5,16,1,0
"362",1574,47,"begging our Lord either to take away her great desire both to be a nun and to found a monastery or give her the means to do so she was convincingly assured that she would be well in time to go, during Lent, to obtain the license. Thus, she says that at that time even though the illnesses weighed more heavily on her, she never lost the hope that our Lord was going to grant her this favor. Even though she was anointed twice (one time she was so close to the end that the doctor said there would be no reason to go for the oils, that she would be dead before they arrived), she never stopped trusting in the Lord that she would die a nun. I don't mean that they anointed her twice between August and the feast of St. Sebastian, but before that.
When her brothers and relatives saw the favor and miracle that the Lord had performed in giving her health so suddenly, they did not dare prevent her from going, although it seemed foolish. She was at the royal court for three months, and in the end the license was not given. When she presented this petition to the king and he learned that it was for discalced Carmelite nuns, he ordered that it be given at once.
19. When the time came to found the monastery, it seemed obvious that she had obtained this from God, for the superiors accepted it even though the town was so far away and the income small. What His Majesty desires cannot be set aside. Thus the nuns came at the beginning of Lent in 1575. The people of the town received them with a solemn procession and great joy. The happiness was so universal that even the children showed that our Lord would be served by this work. The monastery was founded under the patronage of St. Joseph of the Savior this same Lent on the feast of St. Matthias.
20. On the same day the two sisters received the habit with much joy. The health of Doña Catalina continued to improve. Her humility, obedience, and wish to be despised show clearly that her desires had been authentic and for the service of our Lord. May He be glorified forever and ever, amen.
21. This Sister told me, among other things, that almost twenty years ago she went to bed one night longing to find the most perfect religious order there was on earth so as to be",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,2,16,2,5,18,0,1,3,10,5,10,7,8,1,2,0,0,4,0,1
"363",1574,48,"a nun in it. She began to dream, in her opinion, that she was walking along a very straight and narrow road, very dangerous in that one could fall into some deep ravines that appeared. She met a discalced friar. (Seeing Fray Juan de la Miseria, a little friar, lay brother of the order who was in Beas while I was there, she said that he seemed to be the same one she had seen in the dream). He said to her, ""Come with me, sister,"" and brought her to a house with a great number of nuns in which there was no other light than that coming from some candles they were carrying. She asked what order this was; all remained silent, and then they lifted their veils and their faces were joyous and they were laughing. And she declares that she saw the faces of the same Sisters she now sees, and that the prioress took her by the hand and said to her, ""Daughter, I want you here,"" and showed her the constitutions and the rule. When she awoke from this sleep, she felt a happiness that made her think she had been in heaven, and she wrote down what she remembered from the rule. Much time passed in which she didn't tell her confessor or anyone, and no one knew anything about this religious order.
22. When a Father from the Society who knew of her desires came there, she showed him the paper and told him that if he found that religious order she would like to enter it. He knew of these monasteries and told her how what was written was taken from the rule of the order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel; although he didn't explain things to her so clearly, but just spoke of the monasteries that I was founding. Thus she arranged to send me a messenger as was mentioned.
23. When they brought her the reply, she was so sick that her confessor told her to be calm and that even if she were in the monastery they would dismiss her, how much less would they accept her now. She was terribly distressed and turned to our Lord with great anxieties and said to Him: ""My Lord and my God, I know through faith that You are He who can do all things; well, then, Life of my soul, either take away these desires or give me the means to carry them out."" She said this with extreme confidence,",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,16,0,6,12,3,1,1,14,4,9,11,4,5,7,2,4,3,0,0
"364",1574,49,"begging our Lady through the sorrow she felt when she beheld her dead Son in her arms, to intercede for her. She heard a voice within her say: ""Believe and hope for I am He who can do all things; you will be healthy, for He who had the power to prevent so many illnesses, each deadly in itself, from bringing about their effect will more easily take them away."" She says that these words came with such force and certitude that she couldn't doubt that her desire would be granted, even though many more illnesses weighed her down until the Lord gave her the health we have mentioned. Certainly, what she has suffered seems incredible. Had I not been informed by the doctor and those who were in the house, or by other persons, being as wretched as I am, it would not have been unusual for me to think that some of this was exaggerated.
24. Although she is weak, she is now healthy enough to keep the rule. She is a good subject and has a very happy disposition and, as I have said, is humble in everything, which makes us all praise our Lord. The inheritance of each of them was given to the order without any conditions, so that even if they were not admitted to profession the money would still belong to the order. The detachment she has from both her relatives and property is great. And she always has the strong desire to move far away, and thus she begs this of her major superiors very much, although her obedience is so great that she is happily willing to remain there. And in this same spirit she received the white veil; for there was no way of getting her to become a choir Sister, but she wanted to be a lay Sister. This was so until I wrote to her telling her many things, scolding her because she wanted something other than what was her Father Provincial's will. I told her that wanting to be a lay sister was not more meritorious, and I mentioned other things, and dealt with her harshly. And this is her greatest happiness, to be spoken to harshly. As a result she submitted, very much against her will, to becoming to choir Sister. I don't know anything about this soul that does not have to do with her trying to be more pleasing to God, and all the nuns feel the same way. May it please His",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,3,8,1,4,15,1,0,2,11,7,11,10,6,1,8,2,1,7,0,1

CHAPTER 23
 
Treats of the foundation of the monastery of the glorious St. Joseph of Carmel in Seville. The first Mass was said on the feast of the most Blessed Trinity in 1575.
 
1. While I was in this town of Beas waiting for the license from the Council of the Order of Knights for the foundation of Caravaca, a Father from the discalced of our order named Maestro Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios came to see me. A few years before he had received our religious habit while in Alcalá. Throughout his life he has been a man of much learning, intelligence, and modesty along with other great virtues. It seems, while he was in Alcalá, that he was chosen by our Lady for the good of this primitive order without his having the remotest idea of receiving our habit, although he had considered entering the religious life. His parents had other intentions because of his great talent and their good standing with the king, but he was far from being inclined toward their plans for him. From the time he began school, he was urged by his father to take up the study of law. Yet, while still very young, he felt so strongly the desire to study theology that by force of tears he got his father to allow him to do so.
2. After graduating with a master's degree, he took steps to enter the Society of Jesus, and they had accepted him. But for a certain reason they told him to wait several days. He tells me that he was tormented by all the enjoyments in his life and that he didn't think they constituted a safe path to heaven. He always set aside the hours for prayer and was extremely recollected and upright.
3. At this time a close friend of his entered the monastery in Pastrana to become a friar in our order. This friend's name was Fray Juan de Jesús, and he, too, had a master's degree. I don't know how the interest began, whether it did so because of a letter Fray Juan wrote about the greatness and antiquity of our order or in some other way; for Father Gracián enjoyed very much reading everything about the order and verifying, through important authors, what was asserted. He says that he often had scruples about failing to",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,10,0,2,25,0,0,2,11,9,1,5,6,1,2,2,1,3,0,0
"366",1574,51,"study other things because he was unable to set these studies aside, and he occupied his hours of recreation in this way. O wisdom and power of God! How impossible for us to flee from His will! Our Lord truly saw the great need there was for a person like this to carry on the work that He had begun. I often praise Him for the favor He granted us in this matter. Had I very much desired to ask His Majesty for a person to organize all the things pertaining to the order in these initial stages, I would not have succeeded in asking for all that He in fact gave in Father Gracián. May the Lord be blessed forever.
4. Well then, while not having the slightest thought of taking the habit of this order, he was asked to go to Pastrana to speak to the prioress of our monastery there -- for it had not yet been abandoned -- that she might accept a nun. What means the divine Majesty takes! For had Father Gracián decided to go there to take the habit, he would perhaps have met with so much opposition that he might never have done so. But the Blessed Virgin, our Lady, to whom he is extremely devoted, wanted to repay him by giving him her habit. So I think she was the mediatrix through whom God granted him this favor. And this glorious Virgin was the reason he received it and became so fond of the order. She did not want one who desired to serve her so much to lack the occasion for putting this desire into practice. It is her custom to favor those who want to be protected by her.
5. While still a boy in Madrid, he often went to pray before an image of our Lady to whom he had great devotion. I don't remember where it was; he called her ""his love,"" and his visits were very frequent. She must have obtained for him from her Son the purity in which he always lived. He says that sometimes it seemed to him his eyes were swollen from weeping over the many offenses committed against her Son. As a result there arose in him a strong impulse and desire to help souls, and he felt it very deeply when he saw offenses committed against God. He has so great an inclination toward the good of souls that any hardship becomes small to him if he thinks that through",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,0,14,0,4,26,0,2,2,12,4,14,10,11,4,2,1,1,1,3,0
"367",1574,52,"it he can produce some fruit. I have seen this myself in the many trials that he has undergone.
6. Well, the Virgin brought him to Pastrana as though by tricking him into the thought that he was going there in order to request the habit for a nun. And God brought him there in order to give him the habit. Oh, secrets of God! But how true that without our desiring it, He disposes us so as to give us favors. And this soul was repaid for the good deeds that he did, for the good example that he had always given, and for his great desire to serve the Lord's glorious Mother. His Majesty must always repay this latter with wonderful rewards.
7. Well, when he arrived in Pastrana, he went to speak to the prioress that she might accept the nun; and it seemed as though he had asked her to pray to the Lord that he himself might enter. For he is a very pleasant person so that generally he is loved by those who have dealings with him -- it is a grace our Lord gives -- and thus he is extremely loved by all his subjects, both friars and nuns. Yet he doesn't let any fault go by, for he is extraordinarily careful in looking out for the welfare of the religious life. In his actions he is so gentle and pleasant that it seems no one is able to complain about him.
8. Well, when this prioress saw him, that which happened to others happened to her; she felt a strong desire that he enter the order and told the Sisters how important it was to get him to join, for at the time there were very few, or almost none like him. And she told them all to beseech our Lord not to let him go without his receiving the habit.
This prioress is a very great servant of God. By her prayer alone I think she would have been heard by His Majesty; how much more would the prayers of nuns as good as those that were there be heard. All of them took the matter very much to heart and with fasts, disciplines, and prayer begged His Majesty continually. Thus He was pleased to grant us this favor. For since Father Gracián went to the monastery of the friars and saw so much religious observance and opportunity to serve our Lord and above all that it was the order of the Lord's",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,21,0,4,28,0,1,1,7,7,6,9,9,4,3,1,1,1,3,1
"368",1574,53,"glorious Mother whom he so much desired to serve, his heart was moved not to return to the world. The devil set before him many difficulties, especially the pain this would bring his parents. They loved him very much and had great trust that he would help provide for their children, for they had many daughters and sons. He left this care to God for whom he left all, and decided to be a subject of the Virgin and take her habit. So they gave it to him amid the great happiness of all, especially of the nuns and the prioress. The nuns gave much praise to our Lord, thinking that His Majesty had granted them this favor through their prayers.
9. He spent the year of probation with the humility one would find among the youngest novices. His virtue was especially tried at a time when the prior was absent. A very young friar was in charge who had no learning, very little talent, and no prudence for governing. He was without experience since he had only recently entered. The manner in which he guided them was excessive as well as were the mortifications he made them perform. Every time I think of them I am amazed at how Father Gracián was able to suffer them, especially how he could put up with persons like that. The spirituality God gave him was necessary for this suffering. It was clearly seen afterward that the young friar was the victim of much melancholy, and nowhere was he free of it. Even as a subject, he's a source of trouble, how much more so when he governs! The humor has much control over him, for he is a good religious, and God sometimes permits this mistake of putting such persons in office so as to perfect the virtue of obedience in those He loves.
10. So it must have happened that as a reward God has given Father Fray Jerónimo de la Madre de Dios the greatest light in matters of obedience so that as one who had such a good initiation into its practice he might teach it to others. And that he might not lack experience in all the things we need to know about, he underwent the most severe temptations for three months prior to his profession. But as the good captain of the sons of the Virgin that he was to become, he defended himself well against these temptations. For when the devil harassed him most to get",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,13,0,12,25,0,2,3,7,10,9,5,8,1,0,0,1,1,4,0
"369",1574,54,"him to give up the habit, he defended himself by promising to make his vows and not give it up. He gave me a certain work that he wrote while undergoing those great temptations. It inspired me with much devotion, and the fortitude the Lord gave him is clearly seen.
11. It will seem inappropriate that he should have informed me of so many personal matters about his soul. Perhaps the Lord wanted this that I might record it here, and He might be praised in His creatures. For I know that neither to any confessor nor to any other person has this Father manifested so much about himself. At times he had reason for so doing because he thought that on account of my age and from what he had heard about me I had some experience. It was while we were speaking about other matters that he told me about these things and additional ones that cannot be suitably put in writing, for I would be going on at much greater length.
12. Certainly, I have used much restraint so that if this work should ever get into his hands he won't suffer pain. I couldn't help it, nor did it seem to me (for if this work is to be seen, it won't be for a long time yet) that one who did so much good for the renewal of the observance of the primitive rule should be forgotten. Although he was not the one who first began, he came along at the right moment. For sometimes I would have regretted ever having begun had it not been for the great confidence I had in the mercy of God. I'm referring to the houses of the friars, for those of the nuns, through God's goodness, have so far always gone well. Those of the friars were not going badly, but the basis was there for a very quick collapse. Since the discalced didn't have their own province, they were governed by the calced. Those who could have governed, such as Fray Antonio de Jesús, the one who began the renewal, were not given the power to do so. Nor did the friars have constitutions given by our most Reverend Father General. In each house they did as they saw fit. Until the day comes in which they can govern themselves they will have much trouble because some think one way and others another. At times I found them very tiring.
13. Our Lord provided a remedy through the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,1,10,0,4,12,0,0,2,11,7,11,13,7,3,2,1,1,2,0,0
"370",1574,55,"Father Maestro Fray Jerónimo de la Madre de Dios, because they made him apostolic commissary and gave him authority and rule over the discalced friars and nuns. He drafted constitutions for the friars, for we already had ours from our most Reverend Father General, and so he did not draw up any for us. But he did draw them up for the friars through the apostolic power he had and the talents that the Lord has given him as I have mentioned. In his first visitation of the friars, he arranged everything with such moderation and harmony that it indeed seemed he was helped by the Divine Majesty and that our Lady had chosen him to help her order. I begged her very much to intercede that her Son always favor this Father and give him grace to advance far in His service. Amen.

Continues with the foundation of St. Joseph of Carmel in the city of Seville.
 
1. When, as I mentioned, the Father Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián came to see me at Beas, we had never previously met although I had very much desired to meet him. (Yes, at times, we had corresponded.) I was extremely delighted when I learned he was there, for I greatly desired to meet him on account of the good reports given me concerning him. But much greater was my happiness when I began speaking with him, for it seemed from the way he pleased me that those who had praised him had hardly known him at all.
2. Since at that time I had so many difficulties, it seems that when I saw him the Lord showed me the good that was going to come to us through him. So during those days I went about with such excessive consolation and happiness that indeed I was surprised at myself. At that time he did not have authority outside Andalusia. It was when he was in Beas that the nuncio sent to see him and then gave him authority over the discalced friars and nuns of Castile. So much joy did my spirit feel that I couldn't thank our Lord enough those days, nor did I want to do anything else.
3. At this time they had brought the license for the foundation in Caravaca. The permission granted did not correspond with my proposal, and so it was necessary to petition the royal court again. For I had written to the foundresses that the foundation would in no way be made unless",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,9,0,1,16,0,0,0,6,7,5,7,8,3,2,1,0,0,0,0
"371",1574,56,"a certain missing detail were asked for, and so it was necessary to appeal again to the court. It cost me a great deal to wait there so long, and I wanted to return to Castile. But since Father Fray Jerónimo was there, to whom that monastery was subject, and since he was the commissary for the whole province of Castile, nothing could be done without his approval; so I talked to him about it.
4. He thought that if I were to leave, the foundation in Caravaca would fail, and also that a foundation in Seville would render great service to God. It seemed to him this latter would be very easy, for some well-to-do people had asked him and were able and wealthy enough to provide a house at once. The Archbishop of Seville so favored the order that Father Fray Jerónimo believed a foundation would render the order a great service. So it was arranged that the prioress and the nuns who were to go to Caravaca would instead go to Seville, although for certain reasons I had always strongly refused to found these monasteries in Andalusia. If when I went to Beas I had known that it was in Andalusia, I would by no means have gone. The mistake was that although the land was not yet within Andalusia, which I believe begins five or six leagues further, the ecclesiastical province was. Since I saw that a foundation in Seville was the resolve of my major superior, I immediately submitted, although I had decided on another foundation and had some very serious reasons against going to Seville. (This is a favor our Lord grants me, to have the opinion that these superiors are right in everything).
5. Preparations were immediately begun for the journey because it was beginning to get very hot. Father Apostolic Commissary, Gracián, responding to a call from the nuncio left for a meeting with him, and we for a journey to Seville with my good companions, Father Julián de Avila, Antonio Gaytán, and a discalced friar. We journeyed in wagons well covered, which was our mode of traveling, and when we reached an inn we took whatever room was available, good or bad. And one Sister received what we needed at the door, for not even those who journeyed with us entered the room.
6. Although we hurried along on our journey, we did not reach Seville until the Thursday before Trinity Sunday, after having endured scorching heat. Even though we did not",2,3,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,4,2,5,0,5,17,0,0,2,11,11,12,8,5,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"372",1574,57,"travel during siesta time, I tell you, Sisters, that since the sun was beating on the wagons, getting into them was like stepping into purgatory. Sometimes by thinking of hell, at other times by thinking that something was being done and suffered for God, those Sisters journeyed with much happiness and joy. The six souls who were with me were of the kind that made me think I was daring enough to go off with them to the land of the Turks and that they had the fortitude, or better, our Lord gave them the fortitude, to suffer for Him; for this was the subject of their desires and conversations. They were very experienced in prayer and mortification. Since they had to remain so far away, I chose those who seemed to me to be the most apt. And this was all necessary because of the trials that were suffered. Some of the hardships and the greatest, I won't mention because another person might be involved.
7. One day before Pentecost, God gave them a severe trial by sending me a very high fever. I believed that their cries to God were enough to prevent the sickness from getting worse. Never before in my life had I experienced a fever like this without its growing worse. It made me think I had sleeping sickness so withdrawn did it make me. They threw water on my face, but being so hot from the sun, the water provided little refreshment.
8. I don't want to fail to mention the bad inn at which we stayed when I was in this condition. We were given a small room with just a bare tile roof. It had no window, and when the door was opened, the sun poured in everywhere. You must remember that the sun in that region is not like it is in Castile, but much more annoying. The bed on which they made me lie down was such that I would have fared better on the ground. One part was so high and the other so low that one didn't know how to stay in it; it was like lying on sharp stones. What a thing sickness is! For when we're healthy, it's easy to put up with all kinds of inconveniences. Finally I decided it would be better if I got up and we left. It seemed better to me to suffer the sun in the field than in that little room.
9. What will it be like for the poor",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,5,1,9,0,14,13,0,3,7,10,9,6,9,5,0,0,2,2,7,0,2
"373",1574,58,"ones who are in hell? Never will there be any change at all, for even a change from one trial to another brings with it some relief. It has happened to me that when after suffering from very severe pain in one place I experienced other pain elsewhere, the change seemed to provide some relief even though the pain was just as great; so it was in this instance. As for me, insofar as I remember, it didn't cause me any distress that I was sick; the Sisters suffered much more than I. The Lord was pleased that the severity of the fever did not last beyond that day.
10. A little before this -- I don't know whether it was two days -- something else happened to us which got us into a tight spot while we were crossing the Guadalquivir on a barge. When it was time for the wagon to cross, it was not possible to make a straight crossing where the rope was, but they had to wind their way across; the rope from the other shore was of some help by flowing with the barge. However, it happened that those who were holding the rope let it go, or I don't know what happened, for the barge went off with the wagon and without rope or oars. I felt much more concern in seeing the anxiety of the boatman than I did about the danger. We were all praying; the others were all screaming.
11. A gentleman watching us from a nearby castle was moved with pity and sent someone to help, for the barge then had not yet broken loose and our brothers were pulling, using all their strength; but the force of the water dragged them along to the point that some fell to the ground. Indeed, the boatman's son caused in me feelings of great devotion, which I never forget -- he must have been ten or eleven years old -- for the way he was working so hard upon seeing his father in this difficulty made me praise our Lord. But as His Majesty always gives trials in a compassionate way, so He did here. It happened that the boat got stuck on part of a sand bar where there was not much water; thus a rescue was made possible. Since nightfall had come, we would not have known how to continue our journey if someone from the castle had not come to guide us.
I had not thought of dealing with",3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,5,0,13,9,2,2,3,8,13,3,16,9,3,1,6,0,5,0,3
"374",1574,59,"these things because they are of little importance, and I could have mentioned many bad incidents that occurred on our journeys. But I have been urged to enlarge on my account of this trip.
12. A much greater trial for me than those mentioned was what happened to us on the second day after Pentecost. We were hurrying to reach Córdoba in the morning so as to hear Mass without being seen by anyone. For the sake of greater solitude, they led us to a church located on the other side of a bridge. When we were about to cross the bridge, we found that on account of the wagons we needed a license which is issued by the magistrate. This took more than two hours since he was not up yet, and many people approached to find out who we were. This didn't bother us much because, since the wagons were well covered, the people were unable to do so. When the license finally came, we found that the wagons wouldn't fit through the gate of the bridge. It was necessary to saw them, or I don't know what, which took another while. When we finally reached the church where Father Julián de Avila was to say Mass, it was filled with people. The church was dedicated to the Holy Spirit, which we had not known, and thus they were celebrating an important feast in which a sermon was to be preached.
13. When I saw this I was very sorry. It seemed to me better to go without hearing Mass than to enter such turmoil. It didn't seem so to Father Julián de Avila. And since he was a theologian, we all had to follow his opinion. My other companions perhaps would have followed mine, and it would have been ill-advised, although I don't know if I would have trusted only in my opinion. We got out near the church, and although no one was able to see our faces, since we always wore large veils in front of them, it was enough for the people to see us with the veils, the white coarse woolen mantles we wore, and our sandals of hemp for them to get all stirred up; and that's what happened. The shock was certainly a great one for me and for all, and it must have taken away my fever completely.
14. As we entered the church, a friendly man approached me so as to hold off the people. I pleaded with him to",2,6,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,12,0,5,8,1,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,6,3,0,1,1,0,0
"375",1574,60,"bring us to some chapel. He did so and closed it and did not leave us until we left the church. After a few days, he came to Seville and told a Father of our order that he thought God had rewarded him for the good deed he had performed, for the Lord had provided him with, or given him, a large estate about which he had forgotten.
I tell you, daughters, although it may perhaps seem to you to be nothing, this incident was for me one of the really bad moments I went through. From the uproar of the people you would think that a herd of bulls had come into the church. Thus, I couldn't wait to get out of that place. Since there was nowhere nearby to take siesta, we took it under a bridge.
15. When we reached Seville and the house that Father Fray Mariano had rented for us, which he had been told about, I figured that everything was done. As I say, the archbishop favored the discalced and had at times written to me manifesting much love. That wasn't enough to keep him from causing me much trouble, for God so desired it. The archbishop is very much opposed to monasteries of nuns founded in poverty, and he is right. The trouble was that he hadn't been told; or rather, that was to the advantage of this foundation, for had he been told I am certain he would not have agreed to it. Since Father Commissary and Father Mariano (for whom also my arrival had been the source of the greatest happiness) were most certain that by my coming I would be doing the archbishop an enormous favor, they did not tell him beforehand. And, as I say, while thinking they were right, they could have been making a great mistake. With the other monasteries, the first thing I did was to obtain the license from the ordinary of the place as the holy Council requires. In this case, not only did we consider the license as given, but also, as I say, we thought the monastery would be a great favor to him, as it truly was, and this he came to understand afterward. But the Lord desired that no foundation be made without some trial in one way or another.
16. Well, when we arrived at the house which, as I say, they had rented for us, I thought we could immediately take possession, as was my custom, so that we",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,4,3,12,0,4,15,0,0,0,9,10,11,9,4,0,4,0,0,0,1,0
"376",1574,61,"could say the Divine Office. But Father Mariano began to procrastinate -- he was the one who was there -- and so as not to cause me any grief, he did not want to tell me everything. Since he didn't have sufficient reasons, I understood where the difficulty lay, which was that the license had not been granted. The archbishop told me that it would be good if the monastery were founded with an income, or something like that, for I don't remember. Finally, he told me that he didn't like to grant permission for monasteries of nuns, and that since he had been archbishop he had never done so for any. He had been there many years, as well as in Córdoba, and he is a great servant of God. Especially, he didn't like giving a license for a monastery to be founded in poverty and said that he would not do so.
17. This amounted to saying that the monastery must not be founded. First, it would have seemed to me wrong to found in the city of Seville a monastery with an established income even though I could have done so. The places where I did agree to make foundations with an income were small and required that either I found the monastery with an income or not at all since without one there would be no means of sustenance. Secondly, not a cent was left from the expenses of the journey, and we hadn't brought anything with us except what we were wearing and some tunics and toques, and what was necessary in order to cover the wagons and travel comfortably in them. In order that those who came with us could return, they had to look for a way of borrowing. One of Antonio Gaytán's friends who was there lent them what they needed. And Father Mariano looked for what was necessary to furnish the house; nor did we have a house of our own. Thus, it was an impossible situation.
18. Through what must have been persistent pleading on the part of the said Father we were allowed to have Mass, which was the first, on the feast of the most Blessed Trinity. But word was sent that the bell should not be rung; neither was it to be put up, although it had already been put up. We were in this situation more than fifteen days. I know that if it had not been for Father Commissary and Father Mariano, I would definitely",3,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,2,8,10,1,3,13,0,0,1,8,12,16,11,8,2,4,0,0,0,0,0
"377",1574,62,"have returned with my nuns, and with very little regret, to Beas for the foundation in Caravaca. Much greater was the regret I actually experienced those days; since I have a bad memory, I do not remember, but I believe this lasted more than a month. For it was more difficult to return now after the monastery was known than it would have been immediately after our arrival. Father Mariano never allowed me to write to the archbishop, but instead went about gradually trying himself to convince him, making use also of letters from Father Commissary who was in Madrid.
19. As for me, one thing was calming and prevented me from feeling great scruple; it was that Mass had been said with the archbishop's permission, and we always said the Divine Office in choir. The archbishop did not fail to send a visitor with the message that he would see me soon, and an assistant was sent to say the first Mass. Hence I saw clearly that there was no point in my being disturbed. Yet, I felt distressed, not because of me or my nuns, but because of the anxiety Father Commissary experienced. Since he had ordered me to come, he felt very bad and would have been pained were something unfortunate to have happened, and he had many reasons for worrying about that.
20. At this time the calced Fathers came in order to inquire concerning the authority by which the foundation had been made. I showed them the patents I had from our most Reverend Father General. With this they were calmed. But if they had known what the archbishop was doing, I don't think the documents I showed them would have sufficed. However, this was not known, and everyone thought the foundation pleased the archbishop very much and made him happy. Finally, God was pleased that he come to see us. I told him about the harm he was doing us. In the end, he told me that the monastery could remain and in the way I wanted it. From then on, he always favored and supported us in everything that occurred.

CHAPTER 25
 
Continues telling about the foundation named after the glorious St. Joseph in Seville and about what we suffered in order to get our own house.
 
1. No one would have thought that in a city as wealthy as Seville and with so many rich people there would be fewer opportunities for a foundation than in any of the other places I had",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,2,6,0,14,14,4,0,4,14,16,11,5,5,3,4,3,0,1,0,0
"378",1574,63,"gone to. There was so much less help that I sometimes thought that it would not be good for us to have a monastery in that place. I don't know if the climate itself of that territory is the reason. I have always heard it said that the devils have greater leeway there to tempt souls, for God must grant it to them. They certainly afflicted me there, for I never felt more pusillanimous or cowardly in my life. Indeed, I didn't recognize myself, although the confidence I usually have in our Lord did not leave me. But in my human nature I felt very different from the way I usually do after taking part in these things. I figured that the Lord partly withdrew His hand so that my human nature might be left to itself and I might see that my courage did not come from me.
2. Well then, I stayed there from this time of which I am speaking until a little after Lent. There was not a chance of buying a house, nothing either with which to buy one, nor even anyone who would lend to us as there were in other places. Those women who had often told Father Apostolic Visitator that they would enter our community and had asked him to bring nuns there, afterward thought we were too strict and that they would not be able to endure the life. Only one person, about whom I shall speak later, entered. The time, then, came in which I received orders to leave Andalusia because there were other business matters for me to attend to up here. It distressed me deeply to have to leave the nuns without a house, although I saw clearly that I wasn't accomplishing anything there. For the favor God grants me up here of having people to help me in these works, I did not have there.
3. God was pleased at that time that my brother, Lorenzo de Cepeda, return from the Indies where he had been for more than thirty-four years. Feeling worse than I that the nuns would be staying there without having their own house, he helped us a great deal, especially in procuring the house in which they now live. For my part, I pleaded with our Lord, begging Him that I not have to go away and leave the nuns without a house. I had the Sisters ask Him as well as the glorious St. Joseph for this favor and we offered many",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,5,4,13,0,3,11,1,0,0,9,2,7,12,7,2,4,4,1,2,0,0
"379",1574,64,"processions and prayers to our Lady. Along with this, seeing my brother determined to help us, I began discussing the purchase of some houses. Just when it seemed that everything was starting to work out, it all came to naught.
4. One day, while I was in prayer beseeching our Lord to give them a house since they were His brides and had such desire to please Him, He told me: ""I have already heard you; leave it to Me."" I was left feeling very happy since it seemed I already had the house. And this was so. His Majesty prevented us from buying one that because of its nice location was pleasing to all. But the house itself was so old and run down that only the site was being bought and for not much less than was paid for the house we have now. Though all was agreed upon and only the contract remained to be drawn up, I was by no means satisfied. This didn't seem to be in accord with the words I had heard in prayer; for those words, I believed, were a sign that a good house would be given to us. And thus the Lord was pleased that the owner, even though he was making a great profit, should raise a difficulty about signing the contract at the established time, and we were able, without any fault, to get out of the agreement. This was a great favor from our Lord, for there was so much work to be done on the house that the Sisters living there would never in all their lives have been able to do it; and their means were few.
5. Much help was given to us by a servant of God who, from almost as soon as we arrived, began to come each day to say Mass, since he knew that we did not have a celebrant, even though his house was far away and the weather was extremely hot. His name is Garciálvarez. Highly esteemed in the city on account of his good works, he is never occupied with anything but them. And had he been wealthy, we would not have lacked anything. Knowing all about the house, he thought it would be very foolish to give so much for it. Thus, each day he told us so and managed to get us to speak of it no more. He and my brother went to see the house in which the nuns now live. They got",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,10,7,8,0,3,16,0,0,0,11,7,7,8,9,2,4,2,0,1,0,0
"380",1574,65,"to like it so much, and rightly so -- and our Lord wanted this -- that in two or three days the contract was signed.
6. What we had to go through before moving in was no trifle. The occupant did not want to leave, and the Franciscan friars, since they were nearby, came at once trying to persuade us that we should by no means move in. If the contract had not been so firmly signed, I would have praised God that it could be broken, because we found ourselves in danger of paying six thousand ducats for a house we were unable to move into. This was not how the prioress viewed the matter. She praised God that the contract could not be broken, for in regard to that house, His Majesty gave her more faith in Him and courage than He did me; just as in everything else, for she is much better than I.
7. This trouble lasted more than a month. God was finally pleased that we move, the prioress with myself and two other nuns, in great fear, at night so that the friars would not be aware until we took possession. Those who came with us said that every shadow they saw seemed to be a friar. When morning came, the good Garciálvarez, who was with us, said the first Mass, and then our fears left us.
8. O Jesus! How many fears I have suffered before taking possession of these foundations! I reflect on the fact that if one can feel so much fear in doing something good, for the service of God, what must be the fear of those who do evil deeds that are against God and against neighbor? I don't know what they can gain or what satisfaction they can find as a counterbalance to all that fear.
9. My brother was not there yet since he had sought sanctuary on account of a certain error made in the contract which was drawn up so hastily. The error was very harmful to the monastery, and since he was the guarantor of the loan they wanted to arrest him. And because he was an outsider, there was the possibility that they would harass us, and in fact they did, for until he put up collateral there was trouble. Afterward the negotiations went well, although there was some contention at times so that we might suffer greater trial. We were enclosed in some rooms on the ground floor, and he was there all",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,3,12,0,14,13,6,3,2,8,9,12,10,9,1,2,1,0,0,0,0
"381",1574,66,"day with the workers, and he provided us with food as he had been doing before. Since we were in what had been a private home, not everyone knew it was a monastery, and thus there were few alms save for those of the saintly old prior of Las Cuevas, a Carthusian monk and very great servant of God from the Pantoja family in Avila. God gave him so much love for us that from the time we arrived he did not cease helping in every way, and I think he will continue doing so until he dies. We owe a great deal to this saint. I put this down here, daughters, so that if you read it you will pray for the one who helped us so much, and it is right that you pray for him and for all those, living or dead, who have helped us.
10. My brother stayed with us more than a month, I think. (On this subject of time, I have a poor memory and so I could be mistaken; always understand me to be saying ""more or less"" since it doesn't matter.) During this month he worked a great deal in constructing the church out of some rooms in the house and adapting everything so that we didn't have to do anything.
11. After all the work was finished, I wanted to have the Blessed Sacrament reserved without any noisy display, for I am much opposed to causing any bother if it can be avoided, and so I mentioned this to Father Garciálvarez. He spoke about it with the Father Prior of Las Cuevas, for they were looking after our affairs as they would their own. Their opinion was that in order to make the monastery known in Seville the Blessed Sacrament would have to be reserved with solemnity, and they went to the archbishop. All agreed that the Blessed Sacrament should be brought with much solemnity from a parish, and the archbishop ordered that the clerics and confraternities gather for the occasion and that the streets be decorated.
12. The good Garciálvarez decorated our cloister which then, as I mentioned, looked on to the street. And in decorating the church he went to every extreme with many very nice altars and some other contrivances. Among these latter was a fount having orange-flower water which we neither requested nor even wanted; although afterward it did give us much devotion. And we were consoled to see that our festival was celebrated with such solemnity,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6,4,2,15,2,6,14,1,1,3,6,5,9,10,7,4,3,0,0,1,1,2
"382",1574,67,"with the streets highly decorated, and a great deal of music and many musical instruments. The saintly prior of Las Cuevas told me that he had never seen anything like this before in Seville, that it was evidently the work of God. He himself walked in the procession, which he was not accustomed to doing. The archbishop reserved the Blessed Sacrament.
Here you see, daughters, the poor discalced nuns honored by all. A little earlier it didn't seem that there would even be any water for them, although there is a great deal in the river. The number of people that came was extraordinary.
13. One thing that happened, according to all who saw it, is worth noting. Since after the procession there was much shooting of artillery and firecrackers, the people had the urge to continue, for it was almost night. And I don't know how, but some powder caught fire, and it was a great wonder that the person who had it didn't get killed. A huge flame leaped up as high as the cloister. The people thought that the taffeta hangings covering the arches would all be reduced to ashes. But no damage was done to them at all, though they were yellow and bright red. What was frightening is that the stone of the arches, under the hangings, was blackened by the smoke, but the taffeta hangings were left unmarred as if the fire had not reached them.
14. All were amazed when they saw it. The nuns praised the Lord that they didn't have to pay for new taffeta. The devil must have been so angry at seeing another house of God and the solemnity that was demonstrated that he wanted somehow to get revenge. But His Majesty did not allow this; may He be blessed forever, amen.

CHAPTER 26
 
Continues the account of the foundation of the monastery of St. Joseph in the city of Seville. Tells some very noteworthy things about the first nun who entered there.
 
1. You can easily understand, my daughters, the consolation we had that day. For my part, I can tell you that it was very great. I was especially consoled to see that I was leaving the Sisters in a house that was so good and well located, and that the monastery was known, and that there were enough new nuns to pay for the greater part of the cost of the house. Thus, those who in the future, before the established number is reached, may want to enter",3,6,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,0,0,3,6,3,6,18,1,9,14,1,3,2,6,5,6,11,9,10,2,2,0,2,0,2
"383",1574,68,"can do so no matter how little the dowry they bring with them, and the debt can still be paid off. Above all, I was happy for having shared in the trials, and when there was opportunity for a little rest, I left. This festival took place the Sunday before Pentecost in the year 1576, and immediately on Monday, the following day, I departed, for the extremely hot weather was beginning to come and I wanted to be in Malagón before Pentecost and not have to travel on that day. I would have liked to have delayed a day or so, but for the above reason I left in a hurry.
2. The Lord was not pleased that I be there even one day to hear Mass in the chapel. The nuns' happiness was greatly spoiled by my departure. They felt it very keenly, for we had gone through so many trials together in that year. As I have said, I am not recording the worst ones here. In my opinion, aside from the first foundation in Avila (for with that one there is no comparison), none of the other foundations cost me as much as this one did in which the trials were for the most part interior ones. May it please the Divine Majesty that He always be served there, as I hope He will be, for then everything else is of little importance. His Majesty began to draw good souls to that house. As for the five who remained out of the six I brought with me, I have already told you how good they were; that is, something of what can be told, which is the least. I wish to speak now of the first nun who entered there since her story is something you will enjoy hearing about.
3. She was the young daughter of very Christian parents. Her father was from the mountain region. She was still young, around seven, when her aunt, who had no children, begged her mother to allow her to stay with her. When she was brought to the house, her aunt must have shown her much love and affection as was natural. The maids had been hoping they would get the aunt's inheritance, but now it was clear that since the aunt loved the child she would leave it to her. The maids decided together to remove that obstacle through a diabolical plot, inventing a calumny against the child, saying that she wanted to kill her aunt. And in",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,9,1,2,19,0,1,0,3,8,9,8,6,0,5,2,0,0,2,0
"384",1574,69,"order to carry this out they gave one from among them I don't know how much money to buy some corrosive sublimate. When they told the aunt, she believed them at once because they all said the same thing. And the child's mother did too, for she is a very virtuous woman.
4. She took the child and brought her home thinking that she might turn out to be a very bad woman. Beatriz de la Madre de Dios, for that is her name, tells me that for more than a year they spanked, punished, and made her sleep on the floor so that she would confess that she had planned to do something so evil. Since the girl denied that she had done it and said that she didn't know what corrosive sublimate was, her mother thought she was much worse since she was stubborn enough to deny it. The poor mother was so afflicted to see her daughter so headstrong in her refusal to admit she had done anything that she thought her daughter would never make amends. It's amazing that the girl didn't admit she was guilty just to free herself from so much punishment. But since she was innocent, God sustained her so that she continued to uphold the truth. And since His Majesty defends those who are without fault, He sent two of those maids an illness so bad that it seemed they had caught the rabies. Secretly they sent for both the little girl and her aunt and begged pardon from them, and finding themselves at the point of death they retracted. The other maid did likewise before dying in childbirth. In sum, all three of them died agonizing deaths in payment for what they had made that innocent girl suffer.
5. I did not learn this solely from her, for her mother, after she saw that her daughter had become a nun, grieved over the bad treatment they had given her, and told me about it along with other things, for the girl's martyrdoms were many. And God permitted that, without it being her fault, the mother, who was a good Christian and loved her daughter, become her daughter's executioner. This mother is a woman of great honesty and deep Christian spirit.
6. While reading a book on the life of St. Anne, the child, when a little more than twelve years old, became very devoted to the saints of Carmel. For the author of the book says that St. Anne's mother -- I",3,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,3,5,8,6,14,11,1,4,3,15,10,2,5,4,2,3,0,1,2,1,0
"385",1574,70,"believe her name is Merenciana -- often went to speak to those saints. The effect this reading had on the girl was one of great devotion to the order of our Lady, for she then promised to become a nun in that order and also made a promise of chastity. When she could, she gave much time to solitude and prayer. In this solitude God and our Lady granted her many great and special favors. She would have liked to become a nun at once but she didn't dare because of her parents. Nor did she know where to find this order; which is surprising, for there was a monastery of the mitigated rule in Seville. But she had never heard of it until she heard of our monasteries many years later.
7. When she reached the marriageable age, though she was still but a girl, her parents came to an agreement on whom she should marry. She was their only child. Although she had had other brothers, they had all died, and she, the less loved by her parents, was left. (When what I mentioned happened one of her brothers was alive, and he defended her saying that the calumny should not be believed. ) Once the marriage was arranged, her parents didn't think she would have any objection, but when they told her she answered that she had made a vow not to get married and that no scheme whatever on their part, even if they were to kill her, would get her to do so.
8. Because either the devil blinded the parents or God permitted this so that she would be a martyr, they thought she had done something wicked and that for that reason she did not want to get married. Since they had already given their word and their not following through on it would have been taken as an affront by the other party, they gave her so many whippings, inflicted on her so many punishments, even to the point of wanting to hang her, for they were choking her, that it was fortunate they didn't kill her. God who desired her for greater things saved her. She tells me that in the end she hardly felt anything because she recalled what St. Agnes had suffered, that the Lord had brought it to her mind, that she was pleased to suffer something for Him, and that she did nothing but offer herself to Him. They thought she would die, for she was in",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,11,5,7,13,0,4,2,14,9,13,8,2,1,4,1,0,3,1,0
"386",1574,71,"bed three months, unable to stir.
9. It seems very strange that the parents of this young maiden, a girl who never left her mother's side and whose father was very circumspect, should think so much evil of their daughter. She was always holy and virtuous, and very dedicated to almsgiving; all that she could obtain she gave away in alms. If our Lord wishes to grant someone the favor of suffering, He has many means; although, for some years our Lord had been revealing to her parents the virtue of their daughter so that they gave her all she wanted for distributing alms, and the former persecutions were changed into tokens of affection. Nonetheless, because of her longing to be a nun everything was a hardship for her; thus, according to what she told me, she went about dejected and troubled.
10. It happened that thirteen or fourteen years before Father Gracián went to Seville (when nobody had even heard of discalced Carmelites), while she was with her father and mother and two other women who were neighbors, a discalced friar of our order dressed in the coarse wool habits these friars now wear entered their house. They say his face was both fresh and venerable, although he was so old that his beard seemed made of silver threads, and it was long. He approached her and began to speak to her a little in a language that neither she nor anyone else understood. When he finished, he blessed her three times saying: ""Beatriz, may God make you strong."" And then he went away. No one stirred while he was there, but all remained as though stupefied. Her father asked her who he was. She had thought that her father had known him. They got up at once to go and look for him, but he was seen no more. She remained very consoled, and all the others very amazed, for they considered this to be something from God, and so they then began to esteem her highly as was said. After this, all those years passed, I believe they were fourteen, while she was ever serving our Lord, beseeching Him to fulfill her desire.
11. She was very weary by the time Father Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián arrived there. Going one day to hear a sermon in a church in Triana, which is where her father was living, without knowing who the preacher would be -- it was the Father Maestro Gracián -- she saw him go up to",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,10,0,5,10,0,1,2,11,5,7,9,9,3,6,0,2,2,0,0
"387",1574,72,"receive the blessing. When she saw the habit and that he was discalced, she at once recalled the one who she had seen, for the habit was the same; although the face and the age were different, for Father Gracián was not yet thirty years old. She tells me that her joy was so great she almost fainted, for although she had heard that a monastery was founded there in Triana she had not known to which order it belonged. Immediately, from that day she began to try to confess to Father Gracián. Yet God desired that even that would cost her much, for she tried more than, or at least as many as, twelve times, but the Father never wanted to hear her confession. Since she was young and attractive in appearance -- for she must have been no more than twenty-seven -- he avoided conversation with her; he is very circumspect.
12. Finally, one day while she was in the church weeping (being also very reserved), a lady asked her what the trouble was. She told her that she had been trying for a long time to speak with that Father who was then in the confessional and that she had not succeeded. The lady brought her to the confessional and begged him to hear the young girl's confession, and thus this girl was able to make a general confession to him. When he saw what a virtuous soul she was, he was greatly consoled, and he consoled her, telling her that perhaps discalced nuns would come there and that he would arrange that they accept her immediately. And that is what happened. The first command he gave me was that she be the first to be admitted, for he was satisfied with her soul. And he informed her of this after we had arrived there. He insisted that she not let her parents know because otherwise there would be no possibility of her entering. And thus on the feastday of the Holy Trinity she took leave from some women who accompanied her to the church. (Her mother did not go with her when she went to the monastery of the discalced friars for confession, which is where she always went, for it was far away. And she, and her parents through her, gave many alms to the monastery.) She had arranged with a woman who was a very good servant of God to bring her and told the women who were accompanying her that she would",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,19,0,3,11,1,0,1,13,6,8,5,3,3,4,0,1,1,0,0
"388",1574,73,"soon return. And they allowed her to go since the woman companion was very well known in Seville as a servant of God who did great works of mercy. She put on her habit and mantle of coarse wool; I don't know how she was able to move, except that the happiness she felt made everything seem easy. Her only fear was that someone might recognize her behind this heavy habit, so different from her usual mode of dress, and stop her. What wonders the love of God works! Since she was no longer concerned about her honor and thought of nothing but how to realize her desire, we opened the door at once. I sent word of this to her mother. Her mother came to the monastery as though out of her mind; but she said that she already saw the favor God was granting her daughter. And although she was grieved, she overcame it courageously and did not go to the extreme of not speaking to her daughter as others do. She gave us many alms.
13. This bride of Christ began to enjoy the happiness she had so much longed for and was so humble and fond of doing all there was to do that we could hardly get the broom away from her. Whereas in her own home she had been so pampered, here she found all her rest in working. In her great happiness she began to put on weight. This pleased her relatives so much that they were now content to see her there.
14. In order that she would not enjoy so much good without suffering, she experienced very severe temptations two or three months before the time in which she was to make her profession; not because she had decided against making it, but because it seemed to her a very serious step to take. The devil, making her forget all those years in which she had suffered to attain this blessing, was so tormenting her that she could not overcome the temptation. Nevertheless, by absolutely forcing herself, she defeated him in such a way that in the midst of these torments she made the plans for her profession. Our Lord, who must not have been waiting for anything more than the testing of her fortitude, visited and consoled her in a very special way three days before the profession and put the devil to flight. She remained so consoled that during those three days it seemed as though she was outside",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,3,0,10,1,9,18,1,0,4,12,12,5,9,6,2,2,3,0,0,1,1
"389",1574,74,"herself with happiness; and rightly so because the favor had been great.
15. A few days after she entered the monastery, her father died. Her mother took the habit in the same monastery and gave all she possessed in alms. Both mother and daughter experience the greatest happiness, edifying all the nuns and serving Him who granted them so wonderful a favor.
16. A year had not passed before another young lady, against the will of her parents, entered. And thus the Lord continues to fill this house of His with souls so desirous of serving Him, for neither austerity nor enclosure deters them. May He be blessed and praised forever and ever, amen.

CHAPTER 27
 
Treats of the foundation made in the town of Caravaca. The Blessed Sacrament was reserved on New Year's Day, 1576. The monastery is under the patronage of the glorious St. Joseph.
 
1. While I was at St. Joseph's in Avila about to leave for the foundation in Beas that was mentioned -- for the only thing we had still to prepare was the means of transportation -- a private messenger arrived from a lady in Caravaca named Doña Catalina. After hearing a sermon preached by a Father from the Society of Jesus, three young ladies went to her house determined not to leave until a monastery was founded in that town. This action must have been something they had already discussed with this lady who is the one who helped them make the foundation. They belonged to the most important families of that town. The father of one of them was Rodrigo Moya, a very great servant of God and a man of much prudence. Among the three of them they had enough resources to seek to accomplish a project like this. They learned from the Fathers of the Society of Jesus, who have always favored and helped this work, of what our Lord has done in founding these monasteries.
2. Since I saw the desire and fervor of those souls and that they went so far looking for the order of our Lady, I was moved with devotion and there arose in me the desire to help them carry out their good intention. Learning that Caravaca was close to Beas, I took with me a greater number of nuns than I usually do. My intention was to go there after completing the foundation in Beas. According to the letters these ladies sent, it seemed to me we could come to an agreement. But since the",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,3,0,19,1,1,18,0,0,0,5,13,5,5,6,2,1,0,0,1,0,0
"390",1574,75,"Lord had disposed otherwise, my plans were of little help, as was said when speaking of the foundation in Seville. For they had obtained the license from the council of the Order of Knights in such a way that even though I had made up my mind to go, I had to give up the idea.
3. The truth of the matter is that when I learned in Beas where Caravaca is and saw that it was so out of the way and the road for those who would have to visit the nuns was so bad and that the superiors would be displeased, I had little enthusiasm for making the foundation. But since I had raised the hopes of those ladies, I asked Father Julián de Avila and Antonio Gaytán to go there to see what the place was like and, if they so decided, to cancel the plans. They felt lukewarm toward the project not because of the three who wanted to be nuns but because Doña Catalina who was mainly responsible for the foundation, for she kept these ladies in a separate room by themselves as though they were already enclosed.
4. These nuns, or better, these who were about to become nuns, especially two of them, were so convinced of their vocation that they knew how to gain the goodwill of Father Julián de Avila and Antonio Gaytán. Before returning, these latter two signed the documents of agreement and returned leaving the young ladies very happy. They came back so enthused about these women and the place that they never stopped talking about it, nor did they stop talking about the bad road. Since I saw that the agreement had been reached but that the license was delayed in coming, I sent the good Antonio Gaytán there again who for love of me underwent all the hardship willingly. He and Father Julián de Avila were eager that the foundation be made. The truth of the matter is that they are the ones who should be thanked for this foundation. If they hadn't gone there and reached an agreement, I would not have bothered about it.
5. I sent Antonio Gaytán to put up the turn and the grille in the house where the nuns were going to live until finding another suitable one. This was the house of Rodrigo de Moya, who, as I mentioned, was the father of one of these ladies, and very willingly allowed them to use a part of his house. Antonio Gaytán",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,4,0,6,0,3,17,0,1,0,7,15,8,5,4,3,2,1,0,0,1,0
"391",1574,76,"remained there doing this work for many days.
6. When they brought the license and I was about ready to depart for Caravaca, I learned from the license that the house would have to be subject to the council of the Order of Knights and obedience given to them, which is something I could not do because we belonged to the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
And thus, another license was asked for that would not have this condition, for otherwise neither there nor in Beas would a foundation be possible. When I wrote to the king, who at present is Don Philip, he granted me the great favor of issuing orders that the license be granted. The king is so fond of favoring religious who he knows are faithful to their profession that once he had learned of the manner of life in these monasteries and that we follow the primitive rule, he favored us in everything. And thus, daughters, I beg you that special prayer be always offered for his majesty, as is done by us now.
7. Since they had to petition again for the license, I departed for Seville by order of Father Provincial, who was then, and still is, Father Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios , as was said. And the poor young ladies were enclosed there until the following New Year's Day. It had been around February when they had sent me a messenger in Avila. The license, then, was obtained in a short time, without delay. But since I was so far away and involved in so many troubles, I was not able to help them. And I felt most sorry for them, for they wrote to me frequently very distressed, and so I could not bear making them wait any longer.
8. Since it was impossible for me to go because I was so far away and the foundation in Seville was not completed, Father Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián, who was the apostolic visitator, as was mentioned, ordered those nuns to go, even though I could not go with them, who had been chosen for the foundation and who were waiting at St. Joseph's in Malagón. I arranged for someone to be prioress who I trusted would fulfill the office very well, for she is far better than I And taking with them all the provisions, they left with two discalced Fathers of our order. Father Julián de Avila and Antonio Gaytán had already returned home some time before,",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,1,5,0,3,13,1,0,0,4,12,8,6,4,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
"392",1574,77,"so I did not want them to accompany the Sisters because they were too far away and the weather was so bad, for it was the end of December.
9. When the nuns arrived in the town, they were received with great joy by the people and especially by those women who had been living an enclosed life. They founded the monastery, reserving the Blessed Sacrament, on the feast of the Holy Name of Jesus, in the year 1576. Two of the women immediately took the habit. The other one suffered very much from melancholy. It must have been bad for her to live an enclosed life, and how much more so when it was so strict and penitential. She decided to return home to live with one of her sisters.
10. Reflect, my daughters, on the judgments of God and on our obligation to serve Him who has allowed us to persevere until making profession and to live always in the house of God and be daughters of the Virgin. For His Majesty benefited by the good will of this young lady and by her property so that the monastery could be founded, and when the time came for her to be able to enjoy what she had so desired, she was lacking in fortitude and became subject to the melancholic humor. This latter, daughters, we often blame for our imperfections and inconstancy.
11. May it please His Majesty to give us abundant grace, for with this, nothing will prevent us from advancing ever in His service. And may He protect and favor all of us so that this excellent beginning, which He was pleased to initiate in women as miserable as we, may not be lost through our weakness. In His name I beg you, my daughters and Sisters, that you always ask our Lord for this and that each one who enters in the future bear in mind that with her the observance of the primitive rule of the order of the Virgin, our Lady, begins again and that she must in no way consent to any mitigation. Consider that through very little things the door is opened to very big things, and that without your realizing it the world will start entering your lives. Remember the poverty and hardship that was undergone in obtaining what you now quietly enjoy. If you note carefully, you will see that in part these houses, most of them, have not been founded by men but by the powerful hand of God",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,1,10,0,9,13,1,1,5,6,7,7,7,6,1,1,1,1,4,2,0
"393",1574,78,"and that His Majesty is very fond of advancing the works He accomplishes provided we cooperate. From where do you think a useless woman like me, subject to obedience, without even a maravedi, with no one to help me in any way, could get the power for such great works? For this brother of mine, who helped with the foundation in Seville and had the means, courage, and goodness of soul to help, was in the Indies.
12. See, my daughters, see the hand of God. Well, it could not be because I am from the nobility that He has given me such honor. In whatever way you want to look at this you will recognize that it is His work. It would not be right for us to undermine it in any way. We must not do so even if it cost us our life, honor, and tranquility. Moreover, we have everything here, for to have life is to live in such a way that there is no fear of death or of any of life's happenings, to have an habitual happiness, as you now all have, and to enjoy this prosperity that cannot be surpassed when there is no fear of poverty, but on the contrary desire for it. Well, to what can the interior and exterior peace that you always enjoy be compared? It is in your power to live and to die with this peace, as you have witnessed in those you have seen die in these houses. For if you always ask God to foster this way of life and you trust not at all in yourselves, He will not deny you His mercy. And if you have confidence in Him and have courageous spirits -- for His Majesty is very fond of these -- you need not fear that He will fail you in anything. Never refuse to accept because they are not wealthy those who ask to become nuns provided they are virtuous and you are pleased with their desires and talents, and they do not come merely as a remedy for their social situation but come to serve God with greater perfection. God in other ways will provide doubly for that which you might lack because of doing this.
13. I have much experience of this. His Majesty knows well that insofar as I can remember I have never refused to accept anyone because of lack of money, provided I was satisfied with all the rest. The witnesses of this are the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,4,8,3,5,28,3,0,2,8,6,13,10,11,4,0,1,1,3,0,0
"394",1574,79,"many who have been received only for God, as you know. And I can certify that when I received those who brought much wealth I did not feel as great a joy as I did with those I accepted only for God. On the contrary, I had fear about those with wealth, but the poor filled and enlarged my spirit with a happiness so great I wept for joy. This is the truth.
14. Well, if when we had to buy and build houses we got along so well following this procedure, why shouldn't we do so now that we have a place to live? Believe me, daughters, the means by which you think you are accumulating are those by which you will be losing. When the person about to enter has wealth, without any other obligation, it is good that she give it to you as alms instead of giving it to others who have no need of it. For I confess that it would seem to me a lack of love if she didn't do this. But always bear in mind that the one who is about to enter should dispose of her possessions in conformity with what learned men advise her is for the greater service of God. It would be very bad if we were to look for any other good from those who enter this service. We gain much more when she does what she ought for God -- I mean with greater perfection -- than from all that she brings with her, for none of us is aiming after anything else. Nor may God allow this to happen, but only that His Majesty be served in all and through all.
15. And although I am wretched and miserable, I say this for the honor and glory of God and so that you may rejoice in how these houses of His were founded. Never in any business related to these foundations, nor in anything that happened relative to them, did I do anything or would I have done anything -- I mean with regard to these foundations -- that I understood to go contrary to the will of God in even one point, and this, too, when I thought that in order to succeed I would have to cover up my intentions. I proceeded according to what my confessors advised me, for since I have been working on these foundations, my confessors have always been very learned men and great servants of God, as you",2,3,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,2,6,12,0,5,21,2,0,3,17,9,12,14,8,1,1,1,0,0,1,0
"395",1574,80,"know. Nor, insofar as I remember, did anything else pass through my mind than to proceed in this way.
16. Perhaps I am mistaken and have done many things wrong without realizing it; and the imperfections are countless. Our Lord who is the true judge knows that my intentions were good, insofar as I could discern concerning myself, I mean. Also, I see clearly that this good did not come from me but from God who willed that this work be done, and because it was His work He favored me and granted this gift. The reason why I'm telling you this, my daughters, is that you may understand how obliged you are and know that so far nothing offensive has been done to anyone. May He who has done everything be blessed and may charity be awakened in the persons who have helped us. May it please His Majesty to protect us always and give us His grace so that we will not be ungrateful for so many favors, amen.
17. You have seen, daughters, that we have undergone some trials, although I believe I have written about the least part of them. For it would be tiresome if I had to describe in detail the roads, the rain and snow, and getting lost and, above all, frequently, my very poor health. With regard to this latter it happened to me -- I don't know if I mentioned it -- that on the first day of our journey from Malagón to Beas I was traveling with a fever and so many illnesses all together that while considering the distance we still had to travel and seeing myself in this condition I remembered our Father Elijah when he was fleeing from Jezebel, and said, ""Lord, how can I suffer this? You take care."" The truth is that when His Majesty saw me so weak, He suddenly took away my fever and illness. This so happened that afterward when I thought about it I figured that perhaps it was because a priest, a servant of God, was going to enter the order there; at least the exterior and interior illnesses were suddenly taken away. When I had good health, I underwent the bodily hardships with joy.
18. Well, putting up with the many different personalities one necessarily finds in every town caused no small amount of trouble. And to leave my daughters and Sisters when going from one place to another, was not the smallest cross, I tell you, since I love",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,7,0,8,15,0,1,2,16,9,5,11,9,4,1,0,1,9,1,0
"396",1574,81,"them so much; especially when I thought I was not going to return to see them again and I saw their great sadness and tears. Even though they are detached from other things, God has not given them the gift to be detached from me, perhaps so that it might be a greater torment to me, for I am not detached from them either, even though I forced myself as much as I could so as not to show it and I reprimanded them. But this was of little help since their love for me is great, and in many ways it is obvious that this love is true.
19. You have heard how it was not just with the permission of our Most Reverend Father General that these foundations were made but that I was ordered under obedience by him afterward to do so. And not only this, but he used to write to me about the great joy each new house that was founded gave him. Assuredly, the greatest relief I experienced in the midst of the trials was to see the happiness this work gave to him, for it seemed to me that by giving him this happiness I was serving our Lord since he is my major superior, and besides this I love him much.
20. That which came about next did so either because His Majesty desired to give me some rest or because the devil was displeased that so many houses were being founded where our Lord was being served. (It was easy to understand that what came about was not the will of our Father General because he had written me not many years before in answer to my request not to found any more houses that he would not stop ordering me to do so because he wanted me to make as many foundations as I had hairs on my head.) Before I came back from Seville, a general chapter was held. In a general chapter one would think they would be concerned about the expansion of the order, but instead the definitory gave me a command not merely to make no more foundations but not to leave the house in which I chose to reside, which would be a kind of prison, for there is no nun who for necessary matters pertaining to the good of the order cannot be ordered by the provincial to go from one place to another, I mean from one monastery to another. And what was",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,4,0,6,0,3,16,0,0,2,7,18,8,7,4,3,1,1,2,0,3,0
"397",1574,82,"worse and what made me sad was that our Father General was displeased with me, without any reason at all, because of information given by biased persons.
Along with this I was told of two other serious calumnies that were raised against me. I tell you, Sisters, so that you will see the mercy of our Lord and how His Majesty does not abandon the one who desires to serve Him. For these calumnies not only failed to make me sad but gave me so great an accidental joy that I could not restrain myself. As a result, I'm not surprised at what David did when he went before the ark of the Lord, for because of my joy which I didn't know how to conceal I wanted to do nothing else at the time. I don't know the reason, for this has never happened to me in all the other great criticism and opposition I have received. Moreover, one of these two calumnies spoken against me was most serious. But the command not to make foundations -- aside from the displeasure of our Most Reverend Father General -- brought me great tranquility and was what I was often desiring: to end my days in quiet. But this was not what those who devised this were intending. They wanted to inflict on me the greatest sorrow in the world, and perhaps they may have had other good intentions.
21. On occasion, also, the strong opposition and criticism (sometimes offered with good intentions and at other times for other purposes) that I received in making these foundations gave me great joy. But I don't ever remember, no matter how much the hardship, experiencing happiness as great as I did in this instance. For I confess that at other times any one of these three things that came all together would have been a severe trial for me. I believe that my main joy came from my thinking that since creatures repaid me like this I was pleasing the Creator. For I am convinced that he who looks for joy in earthly things or in words of praise from men is very much mistaken, without mentioning the little advantage there is in them. Today people will think one thing, tomorrow another; at one time they will speak well of something; soon they will speak badly of it.

22. I began to write about these foundations by order of Father Maestro Ripalda of the Society of Jesus, as I said at the beginning, for he was then the rector of the College in Salamanca and my confessor. While I was in the monastery of St. Joseph in that city in 1573, I wrote about some of these foundations. But because of my many duties I set the work aside. I did not want to continue, for Father Ripalda was no longer my confessor, and we lived in different places, and also because of the great hardship and trials that what I have written cost me; although since I was always ordered to do so under obedience, I consider them well worthwhile. Though I was determined to write no more, the apostolic commissary, who is now Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios, ordered me to finish the account of these foundations. Being wretched in the practice of obedience, I told him of the little opportunity I had and other things that came to my mind and also that the task was very tiring for me on top of all the other things I had to do. Nonetheless, he ordered me to finish them little by little as best I could. This I did submitting in everything to what those who know about these things might want to delete. What is poorly expressed, let them delete, for perhaps what seems to me better will sound bad to them.
I have finished today, the vigil of St. Eugene, the fourteenth day of the month of November in the year 1576 in the monastery of St. Joseph in Toledo. This is where I now reside by order of Father Apostolic Commissary, Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios, who we now have as superior for the discalced friars and nuns of the primitive rule, and who is also visitator for those of the mitigated rule living in Andalusia. May this work contribute to the honor and glory of our Lord Jesus Christ who reigns and will reign forever, amen.
For the love of our Lord, I beg the Sisters and Brothers who might read this to recommend me to our Lord that He might have mercy on me and free me from the pains of purgatory, if I should be there, and let me enjoy Him.

If the love You have for me,
Is like the love I have for You,
My God, what detains me?
Oh, what is delaying You?
-- Soul, what is it you desire of me?
-- My God, nothing other than to see You.
-- What is it that you fear more than self?
-- What I fear most is the loss of You.
A soul hidden in God,
What has it to desire
Save to love more and more,
And, in love all hidden
Again and again to love You?
 
One all possessing love I ask
My God, my soul centered in You,
Making a delightful nest,
A resting place most pleasing. 14. At the Birth of the Infant God
 
My Gallejo, look who is coming.
Angels they are, the dawn is nigh.
 
My ears are ringing
With what seems an old song
Look, Bras, daylight is here.
Let us go to the shepherdess.
My Gallejo, look who is coming.
Angels they are, the dawn is nigh.
 
Is she a relative of the Mayor,
Or who is this maiden?
God the Father's daughter,
Glowing starlike.
My Gallejo, look who is coming.
Angels they are, the dawn is nigh. 24. For the Clothing of Sister Jerónima De La Encarnación
 
Who has brought you here young lady
From the valley of grieving?
-- God and my good fortune. To the Very Illustrious Señor Don Teutonio de Braganza, my lord.
1. Jesus. The grace Of the Holy Spirit be with your lordship. I tell you definitely that if you address your letter to me again with those titles, I won't reply. I don't know why you want to displease me, although I was not so aware of this displeasure until today. Find out from Father Rector how he addresses letters to me, and don't add anything more, because the titles you use are against the spirit of our order. I am glad that he is well, for I was concerned about him. I beg you to give him my best regards.
2. This seems a difficult time of the year for you to be seeking a cure. May it please the Lord that the cure be successful, as I am begging him. May His Majesty bring back your servants in good condition. I am already beseeching him for this. But I would rather you weren't so troubled -- what will this distress do to your health? Oh, if we understood well these truths,",3,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,2,2,20,2,7,25,3,0,2,6,6,11,15,4,6,4,0,1,1,6,0
"400",1574,85,"few things would trouble us on this earth.
3. I sent the letter at once and wrote to Father Rector telling him how important it was to me that he act quickly. I owe him a great deal. He arranged everything for a house we have already bought, glory to God -- tell Father Rector -- which is a very good one, close to the one where we are living now, which is in a good location. It belongs to a gentleman named Diego de Porres. Padre Acosta will describe it for you; give him my regards and tell him that his novices grow happier each day, and we with them. They ask for your prayers and for those of the nuns. But what bad manners I have to be asking you to deliver these messages. Truly, it's your humility that bears with all this.
4. With regard to the desire you experience to cut short your prayer, pay no attention to it. Instead praise the Lord for the desire you have for prayer and believe that this is what your will wants -- and love to be with God. Melancholy dislikes being treated with severity. It is best to use less severe means and at times relax outdoors where you can walk and see the sky; your prayer will suffer no loss because of this; it's necessary that we bear our weakness and not try to constrain our nature. Everything amounts to seeking God, since it is for him that we search out every kind of means, and the soul must be led gently. In this regard and in everything else, my Father Rector will better discern what is appropriate for you.
5. They are awaiting Father Visitator, for he is on his way. May God reward you for your care in wanting to favor us. I will write to you when I find out where he is. What is important is that you speak with him, for he will pass through there. I am better now; may it please the Lord that you will be so also and that the cure will be of great benefit to you.
Today is 3 July.
Your lordship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. From the letter of Padre Maestro Fray Domingo, you will see what is happening and how the Lord has arranged matters in such a way that I will be unable to see you. I assure you I deeply",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,3,19,0,9,22,0,1,3,6,6,6,3,9,3,1,0,0,2,1,0
"401",1574,86,"regret this, for it is one of the things that would now give me consolation and pleasure. But this disappointment will pass away also, as do all the things of this life; when I think of this, I can bear well anything that displeases me.
2. My best regards to my dear Casilda (for I also regret not being able to see her) and to María de la Cruz. On some other occasion the Lord will so arrange things that more time will be available than there would have been at present. Take care of your health (now you see how important that is and how it saddens me that you are ill); and try to be very holy, for I tell you, holiness will be necessary if you are going to bear the trial you have there. I no longer have the quartan fevers. When the Lord wants me to do something, he then gives me better health.
3. I will be going at the end of this month; and I am still afraid that the nuns here won't be established in their house when I leave. We have agreed to give the chapter six hundred ducats at once; from one of the sisters we have a very good title to an income worth six hundred and thirty. Well, we haven't been able to find anything about this title; no one will accept it or take it as collateral. Pray for this; it would make me very happy not to have to leave the nuns before they are settled in their house. If Señora Doña María had given the money, they would have readily accepted the title, for it is very good and safe. Let me know if this might be possible, or if there is anyone who might accept it or who would give us a loan on good collateral worth more than a thousand. And pray for me, since I have to make such a long trip and in winter.
4. The end of this month, at the latest, I will go to the Incarnation. If you want to send something, write to me, and don't be sad about not seeing me. Perhaps it would make you sadder to see me, I'm so old and worn-out. Give my regards to all. Isabel de San Pablo would very much like to see you. These canons have mortified us all. May God forgive them.
5. Do you know anyone there who could lend me some reales? I don't want them as",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,5,8,0,7,19,1,0,6,8,6,18,21,4,5,0,0,0,5,0,0
"402",1574,87,"a donation but only until I am paid what my brother gave me, for they say it has now been collected. To go to the Incarnation without a cent would be a mistake. And here there is nothing available since they have renovations to complete on the house. Whether little or much, try to get something for me.
6. Now they have spoken to me of two nuns with very good dowries who would like to enter here. They would bring more than two thousand ducats each; this could go to pay for the house, which cost four thousand, and to pay the six hundred to the canons, and still more. I am telling you this that you might praise the Lord, for he has granted me a favor; and the two women being received are so good. I have not heard anything about Doña María's business affairs; write to me about them, and send her greetings from me, and let us see if she sends something.
7. Glory to God that my Padre Fray Domingo is well. If by chance Padre Maestro Medina passes through, give him this letter from me for he thinks I am angry with him, according to what Father Provincial says, because of a letter he wrote me. It was a letter deserving thanks rather than anger. He must be wondering also if I know what he said to the other person, although I said nothing to him about it. Our Father Visitator told me she was already a nun and had no more than a thousand ducats for a dowry. Write to me about how she is doing and what Father Visitator says. Well since she is from his order, he will be patient.
8. I wrote to you a short while ago. I don't know whether you received it. It is not right for you to go so long without writing to me, for you know how delighted I am with your letters. May God be with you. It's strange how difficult I am finding it not to be able to see you -- I had still been hopeful.
Today is 11 September.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be with your lordship. I was greatly consoled to learn about the state of your health. May it please our Lord that you continue to improve. I have prayed much to His Majesty for you; would you now do the same for me. I need your prayers because of the long",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,7,14,0,5,14,0,2,0,7,7,13,14,2,2,7,0,0,1,0,0
"403",1574,88,"distances I will have to be traveling.
2. I am writing to Father Rector about the command Father Visitator has given me; you may ask him about it. He told me to write to you about how he had given me orders to stay at St. Joseph's. He also told me that Father Prior of Atocha had written him that the nuncio said that because it seemed to him a good thing he was giving permission for the monastery. He didn't tell me to write about this to you; he must have thought that you knew of it from the nuncio. I have learned that he desires to please you in everything, which made me happy. And I would be glad if that cleric were to stay in your house, if that's agreeable to you.
3. Padre Gómez has been here several times, which seems to me a good thing. He told me he wanted to know if that person who left here was in agreement with you, for he knew that he was in Salamanca. I urged him to pray for you since your health was bad, and he took on the obligation. We are also praying for the matter you entrusted to our prayers, that our Lord will bring about what will be for his greater service. May His Majesty show his power, and may he guide you. I didn't really have the time to write to you today, so I won't enlarge on this.
Today is 15 September.
Your lordship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. Knowing of your own disappointment seems to console me for having to leave without seeing you. Well, the Lord can arrange things in ways that we don't now foresee, and then we'll have more time together. Certainly, while I have been here, there has been no possibility of doing anything else. A short visit becomes very tiring. One does nothing but visit and one even gives up sleep so as to continue talking -- and idle words are never lacking -- for great is the desire to be with you. But many things I would like to speak to you about cannot be discussed by letter; one of them is the desire not to humiliate Maestro Medina. Believe me, I have my reasons for this and have seen some good results; don't fail, then, to send him the letter, and don't be bothered, even if he seems less friendly; he",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,1,0,11,0,5,14,1,2,2,13,6,12,15,4,2,2,0,1,2,0,0
"404",1574,89,"isn't obliged to us, nor does anything he might say about me matter in the least. Why doesn't he say it directly to me?
2. I want you to know I told Father Provincial that they had worked things out well in taking Samanó from us. Do you know what I realize now? God wants you to be poor but with honor, for he gave you Casilda, who is poor but worth more than all the money in the world. It seems that Father Visitator has become aware of this and wanted to explain things to me, at least he made many excuses for Orellana; so I believe it was Casilda who wanted this. I become angry when I have to speak of this blessed soul.
3. I wrote you a letter after the one that you answered and sent it with a Theatine -- or I don't know with whom -- or better, it was with the one who usually brings messages to the prioress of the Mother of God. In it I told you that we have found the money and that everything is concluded, glory to God. I am in a hurry for us to move before I leave. I don't know if things will be ready. There is little to do, and the house is next to this one. Do not worry. God reward you for your advice. I believe I understood what you crossed out. You should know that Beas is not in Andalusia, but five leagues this side, for I know that I cannot make foundations in Andalusia.
4. The book arrived here, I think, two or three days after the bishop left for Madrid. I have to send it to him there, but I don't know where he is staying. So, I am sending it to you to give to him just as it is when he leaves, but give him this letter addressed to his lordship right away. In it I include a message for Señora Doña María.
5. I am bringing Ana de Jesús as prioress, who is from Plasencia and whom we received at St. Joseph's; she has been living in Salamanca and is there now. I don't at present see anyone else who would be good for your region. The truth is they are saying wonderful things about the holiness and humility of one of the two ladies who are sponsoring the foundation; they are both good. No one should be brought there who is going to be an imperfect example,",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,5,8,0,2,11,1,1,0,20,6,8,9,4,1,4,0,0,1,0,0
"405",1574,90,"for from what they say that house will mark the beginning of much good. I mention this for the nun who is with you.
6. Another foundation, please God, will be made soon. But someone who doesn't get along with you would have a bad effect on a new foundation. Nonetheless I would have very much wanted to bring her along. Four of those who came from Pastrana will be going, and still that is not many, because with the two who are now going to enter we would have twenty-two here. The one with 1500 ducats is entering Saturday, and all are amazed by her fervor; I don't know where it will end up. Those nuns who are here, I assure you, are all extremely good. With six going from here, along with the prioress, who is not a native of this town, and the subprioress, a sufficient number of nuns will still be left. There are, in fact, four lay sisters, who are extremely good. Still, one will be forced to transfer more of the nuns, for I understand there are some very good women who would like to enter. You see now how one could hardly fail to make a foundation in Beas! And still another monastery is needed.
7. You think, my daughter, that you were showing me great consideration in advising me not to go. My departure will take place this coming winter, for God has so willed. Considering the harm it caused me, I don't know how I suffered the cold of this region. Don't think I suffered little from it here. It may be that ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I assure you that your letter delighted me; it seems you wrote it for no other purpose. May God reward you for the goodness you have shown me through it and by all that you say. As for the rest, these days I have not even been thinking of myself, much less of food. When I have a free moment, I tell you, I grow more concerned than when I was there. I don't know how you can say that I inspired courage, for it was you who gave courage to all of us, and so I beg you to continue doing so.
2. It made me very sorry to learn that they are beginning to use the bread. The proceeds from its sale would have provided me with my only collateral. I fear lest we",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,2,11,0,8,19,1,0,3,12,15,8,6,9,1,3,1,0,1,0,2
"406",1574,91,"lose on the one hand what we gain on the other. I have already given orders that they buy bread; that should be possible through what accrues from the sale. I am looking around here to see if I can scrape something together for my return. In sum, I hope in the Lord that we will not want. So, would you continue helping us in your usual way? I will serve you by praying to the Lord for you; please do the same for me. I am well and have so many letters to write that I can't say more.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
3. Out of charity would you visit Francisco de Salcedo for me, and tell him I have been distressed over his illness but was delighted to learn from this messenger that he is not bothered at all by the litigation. After I wrote to him, they told me that he was taking it very hard, and this grieved me. He must not have received my letter. Be very careful about letters sent to the little villages; such care is necessary. To the Magnificent Señor Antonio Gaytán, my lord.
1. Jesus be with your honor and repay you for the book you sent, which is just right for me. I would need more time to answer your question -- I mean about what touches on prayer -- although the substance of the answer is that this is a very common way of proceeding by those who have reached contemplation. I have often told you this, but you forget it. You have to realize that just as there are different seasons on this earth, so there are in the interior life, and it cannot be otherwise. So don't be troubled -- you are not at fault.
2. As for the rest, I cannot be a judge, since I am an interested party; and also my natural inclination has always been toward the state of solitude, although I have not merited to have it, and since this is the state proper to our order, I could be giving counsel appropriate for myself but not for what is fitting for you. Speak about this clearly with Father Rector, and he will see what is best; and try observing to which one your spirit has the greater leaning. May God keep you, for I am writing so many letters that I don't know how I have been able to say this much, and the messenger is waiting.
3. As to my departure, there is nothing",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,3,9,1,6,15,1,1,2,8,3,10,8,5,3,3,3,1,3,0,1
"407",1574,92,"new; I don't know how it could be possible this year. God can do all. Pray much to His Majesty for me, as I do for you, and keep me always informed about yourself.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. ... I tell you, mi padre, I think my joys are no longer of this kingdom, for what I want I do not have, and what I have I do not want. What is missing is that the happiness I used to experience in dealing with my confessors is no longer present; one would have to be more than a confessor. Anything less than what the soul desires does not fulfill it. Certainly, it has been a relief for me to write this. May God grant that your honor always find your relief in loving him.
2. Tell your ""poca cosa,"" who is concerned about whether the sisters will vote for her or not, that she is thereby meddling and lacking in humility. For what you and those of us who look after the welfare of that house believe is best will be done rather than what one nun thinks, for we have more interest in a good choice. It is necessary that the nuns be made to understand these things. When you see Señora Doña María, give her my regards for I have not written for some time. It is a good thing that I am better in the midst of this cold weather.
I think it is 3 December, and I am your honor's daughter and servant.
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor always. It would have been a great consolation for me to find you here, and I would have considered the journey well spent had it given me the opportunity to enjoy your company for a longer time than in Salamanca. I do not deserve this favor from our Lord. May he be blessed forever. This prioress has enjoyed your company fully. After all, she is better than I and most dedicated to serving you.
2. I was most happy that you had my Padre Baltasar Alvarez there for several days to provide you with some relief from so many trials. May the Lord be blessed that you are enjoying better health than usual. Mine is now much better than it has been in recent years, and that is saying a lot for this time of year. I have found souls of such quality in this house that I",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,1,18,0,1,30,0,0,1,14,3,9,11,8,2,1,1,0,1,0,0
"408",1574,93,"had to praise the Lord. And although Estefanía certainly is a saint in my opinion, the talent of Casilda and the favors the Lord has granted her after she took the habit have pleased me greatly. May His Majesty lead her forward. For we should have high regard for souls that he takes to himself in so short a time.
3. Estefanía's simplicity in everything except what pertains to God amazes me, for I perceive through her words the wisdom she has in regard to the Truth.
4. Father Provincial has visited this house, and the election has taken place. They have reelected the prioress, and from St. Joseph's in Avila we are going to bring the subprioress elected by them, whose name is Antonia del Espíritu Santo. Señora Doña Guiomar knows her; she is a very good soul.
5. The foundation in Zamora has been set aside for now, and I am going to make the long trip for which I had left before. I have already thought of giving myself the joy of passing through your region so as to pay my respects to you. I haven't received a letter from my Padre Baltasar Alvarez in a long time. Nor have I written to him; certainly not so as to mortify myself, for I never make any progress in this or, it seems, in anything else. But I haven't written because of the torment of having to write so many letters, and when I think of writing one just for my own satisfaction, there is never time. Blessed be God, for we will have security in our eternal enjoyment of him. Here below, certainly, with this flux of separation and change of every kind, we cannot rely much on anything. With this hope for the end, I go through life; they say we do so with many trials, but it doesn't seem so to me.
6. Mother Prioress here is telling me about my ""custodian."" His affability is as pleasing to me as it is to her. May our Lord make him very holy. I beg you to give him my regards. I often pray to the Lord for him and for Señor Don Juan Antonio as well. Don't forget me in your prayers, for love of the Lord, for I am always in need. We can now be at ease about Doña Guiomar, as you say and she herself confirms. I would love to know something about the successful event so as to make a better judgment and share",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,15,0,0,26,0,0,0,7,8,4,13,9,0,2,0,0,1,2,0
"409",1574,94,"in your joy. May our Lord in this Christmas season grant your soul all the great joys that I beg of him for you.
7. On this feast of St. Thomas, Padre Fray Domingo preached a sermon here in which he spoke of trials in such terms that I found myself wanting to have many and that the Lord would give them to me in the future. His sermons are for me a sheer joy. They have elected him prior. It is not known whether he will be confirmed. He is so busy that only briefly have I been able to benefit from his presence. But if I were able to see you for as much time, I would be happy. May the Lord bring this about, and may he give you as much health and rest as is necessary to gain that which has no end.
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.
Your honor's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Although I have not written until now, you can be sure that I do not forget you in my poor prayers before our Lord, and learning of your happiness made me happy. May it please our Lord that you will enjoy many years in his service, for I hope in His Majesty that nothing will impede you from this service, even though there may be obstacles. All those things considered good in this miserable life are obstacles. That you spent these past years for God will be of great benefit to you in judging each thing according to its true worth and counting it as something that will soon pass away.
2. Some time ago Señora Isabel de Córdoba spoke to the prioress of this house, who considers her to be very dedicated to God's service. And so I arranged to speak to her. She told me she is a rather close relative of Señor Albornoz's, which is the reason why I would like her to enter here. However since this house is in the process of being adapted and Doña María Mendoza is the foundress, we will need the help of some alms in order to receive her. Since she told me that Señor Albornoz had promised to help her become a nun, I told her that I thought he would be even more willing to do so if she were to enter this house. Indeed, even were I to want a different arrangement, I wouldn't be able to do",2,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,3,3,17,0,1,21,1,0,1,8,5,12,13,6,1,3,0,0,2,0,0
"410",1574,95,"anything, because of Doña María and also the nuns. Since the number of nuns is small and there are many aspirants, and they are in need, it would be harmful for the nuns not to take in those who can help them. She told me that she has property but that it is of a kind, she is informed, that cannot be sold. When some means are found, even if less than what could be received from others, I will do what I can, for I certainly want to serve you and Señor Albornoz as I ought, for whose prayers I beg. In my prayers, although miserable, I will do what you have asked.
3. May our Lord reward you for the statue. You indeed owe it to me. I beg you to keep it well protected until I ask you for it. That will be when I am more settled in one monastery than I am now; there I will be able to enjoy it. May you do me the favor not to forget me in your prayers. May our Lord grant you all the spiritual blessings that I beg of him, amen.
Today is the feast of the Holy Innocents.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your lordship always and give you many more good years, as many as I desire, and with the holiness I beg for you. I have been waiting a long time to see your handwriting and find out whether you are in Salamanca, for I didn't know where to write to you. And now I don't know if I'll have the time to write at length, as I desire, since I have a very reliable messenger for this letter. I praise our Lord that you are better. My health has been good, which is a lot for this time of year.
2. May His Majesty repay you for the care with which you undertook all that I had asked of you. Well, it seems to me that our Lady, the Blessed Virgin, has chosen you to be the protector of her order. It is consoling for me to know that she will repay you in more ways than I could think of mentioning in my prayers, although I continue to pray for you.
3. The monastery in Zamora has been set aside for now: first, because this is not a suitable time of year (it's the time for going to a much warmer region); second,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,24,0,3,17,1,0,1,9,4,10,11,5,1,0,1,0,2,1,0
"411",1574,96,"because it doesn't seem that the one who was to give us the house responded to all that we expected of him, and he is absent. However, we have not given up. Furthermore, I have also been considering how troublesome it is for a house founded in poverty to have a founder who is not much inclined to helping, especially if he has the right to build the monastery. It seems to me that it would be better to begin in a different way, by buying a house, but this would require more time. The Lord will provide when it pleases him to do so. You have done me a great favor in obtaining the authorization for me at the right time. When a messenger is available you can send it to me, but it is not necessary to hire one immediately.
4. With regard to Torrijos, don't go to any bother about it. In no way does the place appeal to me. I would accept it to comply with your wishes. But for persons of this kind to be received just because we need the dowry would be something unacceptable in these houses, because then we would not be able to send them away at once if they were not suited to our order.
5. I am sorry that the reason for your having undertaken the trip was not realized. Nevertheless, I hope in the Lord that your words will bear much fruit, even though their effect is not seen immediately. May it please the Lord that the business in Rome will go well. I have prayed hard for this, if it be for his service; what I hope is that if it is, he will bring it about, because so many prayers are being offered for that intention.
6. With respect to the countess's monastery, I don't know what to say, for I have been hearing about it for a long time. I tell you I would rather found four monasteries of our nuns than try to convert these blessed souls, however holy, to our manner of living, for within fifteen days from the start our manner of life can be set up so that those who enter do not have to do anything more than what they see is done by the other nuns. I spoke with two of them in Toledo and know that they are doing well in the way of life they have chosen. On the other hand, I certainly don't know how I could",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,4,3,13,0,3,14,0,1,0,12,12,17,12,3,2,3,2,1,3,0,1
"412",1574,97,"receive them under my charge, for I believe they conduct themselves with more rigor and penance than mortification and prayer; I mean in general. Nonetheless, if the Lord so desires, I will find out more, since that is what you seem to want.
7. It was most fortunate that you had the marquis so much on your side, for that is important. May it please the Lord that you receive good news. Regarding the business here, now that you are in the midst of it, I hope in him that all will go well. I will not have to worry any more about letters that displease Padre Olea since it is to you that one ought to write. I have been sorry about it, for much is owed to him and in my opinion my letters got into the hands of others. The prioress of Segovia must not have been on guard, thinking that the matter was not important. It made me happy to know how I can write to you when it is necessary and that when the occasion arises you will speak in favor of my travels. Certainly traveling is one of the things that wearies me in life and one of life's greater trials, and above all when I am judged by others to be doing something bad. I have often thought how much better off I would be remaining at rest and not having the general's command. At other times, when I see how the Lord is served in these houses, everything seems small to me. May His Majesty direct me in doing his will.
8. I tell you there are souls in this house that almost continually, or very frequently, stir me to the praises of God. Although Estefanía is great and, in my opinion, a saint, Sister Casilda de la Concepción amazes me. Certainly I don't find anything in her, exteriorly or interiorly, that would keep her from becoming (with God's assistance) a great saint. What he is doing in her is clearly seen. She is very talented (beyond all possibility for her age) and deeply prayerful, for since she took the habit the Lord has favored her. Her happiness and humility are remarkable; it's a strange thing. Both of them say they will pray for your lordship in a special way.
9. I have not wanted her to write to you: first, because we are being very careful not to let her think we are showing her any special attention (although, indeed, in her",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,15,0,4,21,1,0,0,12,8,9,18,10,2,2,1,1,1,0,0
"413",1574,98,"simplicity she has little need for this; in many ways she's like another Fray Junípero); second, because I wouldn't want you to pay attention to what we poor women tell you, for you have a good padre who awakens and teaches you and a good God who loves you.
10. With regard to Madrid, I don't know the reason, but even though I see that it would be appropriate to have one of these houses there, a strange resistance wells up in me; it must be a temptation. I still haven't seen a letter from Prior Covarrubias. It would be difficult to make a foundation without permission from the ordinary, because the patent letter I have requires this, and also the Council. But I believe we would have the permission, if this were the only thing in need of our attention. May the Lord advance the project.
11. I will be leaving here after the feast of Epiphany. I am going to Avila along the road passing through Medina, where I don't think I'll stay for more than a day or two; the same goes for Avila, in that I am going on at once to Toledo. I want to finish up this business of Beas. Wherever I am, I will write to you as often as I find someone who will deliver a letter to you. In your charity, please pray for me.
12. May His Majesty repay you for the care you show the sisters there, for you are showing great charity; they are not without their trials. I would be so happy to be there. But, since you are not located along the way to the next foundation, it would be very difficult for me to go there. Unless I were to receive a command, I wouldn't go; nor must I do anything without approval of the authorities. I think that since the nuns are offering him more, he will be satisfied, for the place is very good and there is room for expansion (the site you mention seems to me to be out of the way), and the church is nice. In sum, the location is what matters most. As for the rest, it wouldn't bother me much if anything of what has been constructed were lost. Your lordship, along with Father Rector, should consider the whole matter as a transaction to be made for our Lady, and we will act accordingly. Lest some change be introduced, I would like to see the plan delayed, in one",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,2,5,6,0,5,14,0,1,1,10,10,18,12,2,3,0,0,0,0,1,0
"415",1575,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your lordship, amen. After I arrived here in Seville, I wrote to you three or four times, and I did not write any more because the fathers who returned from the chapter told me that you would not be in Rome, that you had gone to visit the Mantuans.
 May God be blessed that the chapter is over. In those letters I also gave you an account of the monasteries that were founded this year, which are three: Beas, Caravaca, and this one here. You have in them subjects who are great servants of God. Two of the houses were founded with an income; the one in this city was founded in poverty. We still do not have our own house; but I hope in the Lord that we will. Because I am certain that one of these letters must have reached you, I am not going to give a detailed account of everything in this one.
2. I also mentioned how different speaking with these discalced Fathers -- I mean Padre Maestro Gracián and Mariano -- is from what one would imagine through what I heard in Castile. Certainly they are your true sons, and I would dare say that, substantially, none of those who insist they are your true sons would surpass them. Since they have asked me to be an intermediary so that you may look favorably toward them again, for they did not dare write to you, I begged you in those letters as earnestly as I could, and so I beg you now, for the love of our Lord, that you do me this favor and believe my words. There is no reason for me to say anything but the complete truth, aside from the fact that I would consider it an offense against God not to speak the truth. And even if it were not an offense against God, I would consider it a great evil and betrayal with respect to a father I so love.
3. When we stand before the judgment throne, you will see what you owe your true daughter Teresa of Jesus. This alone consoles me in these matters; for I well know there must be some who say the contrary. And so, in every way that I can I will try to make all understand, I mean all those who are not prejudiced, that I am your true daughter and will continue to be this as long as",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,5,14,0,5,20,0,4,1,9,9,11,8,17,2,6,0,0,0,2,0
"416",1575,2,"I live.
4. I have already written to you about the commission Padre Gracián received from the nuncio and how he was called to Madrid. You must know by now how he was again given the task of visitator to the discalced friars and nuns and to the province of Andalusia. I know very definitely that with regard to the latter, he tried to refuse in every way he could -- although this is not being mentioned, it is true -- and that his brother, the secretary, was also opposed because nothing would come of it but a great trial.
5. But if these Fathers would have listened to me after it had become a fact, everything would have been done quietly and as though among brothers. And I did all I could to foster this attitude. For, apart from the fact of it being the correct attitude, these Fathers have helped us in every way since we have been here. And, as I wrote to you, I find gifted and learned persons here of the kind that I would love to have in our province of Castile.
6. I am always fond of making a virtue out of necessity, as they say, and so I would have wished that when they decided to resist they would have considered whether or not they would be able to win out. On the other hand, I am not surprised that they are tired of so many visitations and innovations that, for our sins, have been taking place for a good number of years. May it please the Lord that we know how to profit from this, since His Majesty is waking us up. Yet, since the visitator is from the same order, there is less humiliation. And I hope in God that if you show favor to this padre in such a way that he understands that he is in your good graces, everything will proceed very well. He is writing to you and has a great desire for what I said and not to displease you, for he considers himself your obedient son.
7. What I again want to ask you, for love of our Lord and his glorious Mother (whom you so love, and this padre does also since he entered the order through his devotion to her) is that you answer him and do so with gentleness and leave aside the things of the past, even though he may have been somewhat at fault, and receive him as your son and",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,5,0,4,22,1,1,0,11,10,16,7,12,0,4,1,1,2,3,0
"417",1575,3,"subject, for he truly is. And poor Mariano is also, although sometimes it is not evident. I am not surprised that what he wrote to you differed from what he intended, since he doesn't know how to express himself. He confesses in fact that he never intended either in word or in deed to offend you. Since the devil gains so much when things are interpreted according to his own wishes, he must have pushed these Fathers to conduct their affairs badly without their meaning to do so.
8. But note, it is characteristic of sons to make mistakes and of fathers to forgive and overlook faults. For the love of our Lord, I beg you to do me this favor. See how this would be appropriate for many reasons that perhaps you would not understand over there as I do here. And even though we women are not good for giving counsel, we sometimes hit the mark. I don't know what harm could come of it and, as I say, there can be many advantages. And I don't see that any harm could come from your being receptive to those who would very willingly cast themselves at your feet, if you were present, for God never fails to forgive. And no harm can come from your making it known that you are pleased that the reform be carried out by one of your subjects and sons, and, as though in exchange for this, you are happy to forgive him.
9. Would that there were many to whom this task could be entrusted! But apparently there are none with the talents of this padre (for I am certain that if you were to see him you would agree). Why don't you show that you are pleased to have him as your subject and let everyone understand that this reform, if carried out correctly, is being done with your approval and with your advice and counsel? And were others to understand that you are pleased with this work of reform, everything would proceed more smoothly. There are many more things I would like to say in this regard, but I think it will be more to the point for me to beg our Lord to give you understanding of what is appropriate for you to do; because for some time now you have paid no attention to my words. I am fully certain that if I am mistaken in my words, my will does not intend to be.
10. Padre Fray Antonio",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,3,5,0,10,19,0,2,1,16,12,18,11,10,3,2,1,1,0,1,0
"418",1575,4,"de Jesús is here, for he couldn't get out of coming. Nonetheless, he also has begun to defend himself as have the other Fathers. He is writing to you. Perhaps he will be more fortunate than I in getting you to believe us, as would be fitting, with regard to all I am saying. May our Lord provide, as he can, in keeping with our need.
11. I learned of the general chapter act in which I am ordered to remain in one house and not go out. Father Provincial, Fray Angel, had sent it here to Padre Ulloa with orders that he notify me.
 He thought that it would cause me much grief, which was the intention of these Fathers in procuring it, so it was kept from me. It must have been little less than a month ago that I was able to get them to give it to me, for I had heard of it from elsewhere.
12. I assure you that from what I understand of myself, it would have been a great gift and happiness for me if you had sent it to me with a letter to let me know that you were feeling sorry about the great trials I was undergoing in making these foundations -- for I am not much for suffering -- and that as a reward you were ordering me to rest. For even taking into consideration the way it did come, it consoled me greatly to know I could live in peace.
13. Since I have such great love for you, I could not help, sensitive as I am, feeling hurt that the order should come as though to someone very disobedient and in such a way that Padre Fray Angel could publish it in Madrid before I knew anything about it, as though they were using force with me. And so he wrote me that I could have recourse to the papal chamber, as though that would bring me great relief. Indeed, even if the work of making foundations, a task you had given me, had not cost me such great trials, it wouldn't enter my mind not to obey, nor would God allow me to find any happiness in going against your will. For I can truthfully say -- and our Lord knows this -- that if I experienced some relief in the trials and anxieties and afflictions and slander that I have suffered, it was in the thought that I was doing your will and making you",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,5,1,6,14,1,0,4,12,12,17,9,5,0,3,2,0,0,1,0
"419",1575,5,"happy. And now, too, it will bring me relief to do what you command.
14. I wanted to carry out the orders at once. It was close to Christmas and since the journey is so long, they wouldn't allow me, knowing that you would not want to put my health at risk. So, I am still here, but with the intention of remaining in this house only until after the winter passes. I have little in common with the people of Andalusia. And what I beseech you is that you don't forget to write to me wherever I may be. Since I will no longer have business to attend to -- which will certainly bring me great happiness -- I am afraid you will forget me, although I will not give you the chance to do so. Even though it may tire you, I will not fail to write to you for the sake of my own peace of mind.
15. In these parts they have never understood, nor do they understand, the Council or Motu proprio as having taken away from prelates the authority to allow nuns to go outside to do things for the good of the order, for many reason for doing so may occur. I do not say this in regard to myself, but so that you will not have any scruple about the past, for I am not good for anything (and not only am I ready to stay in one house, for this will give me some relief and rest, but even stay in a prison cell if that would make you happy -- and gladly for the rest of my life). For even though I had the patent letters, I never went anywhere to make a foundation -- for otherwise, clearly, I could not have gone -- without a written order or license from the prelate. And so Padre Fray Angel gave it to me for Beas and Caravaca, and Padre Gracián for here, for he had the same commission from the nuncio then that he has now, but he wasn't using it. Yet, Padre Fray Angel said that I was an apostate and excommunicated.
 May God pardon him for you are a witness to how I strove that you would always be on good terms with him and to make him happy -- I mean in matters that would not be displeasing to God -- but he has never managed to act kindly toward me.
16. It would be much more to his",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,1,6,0,3,16,2,0,1,5,12,10,12,6,0,2,0,0,3,0,0
"420",1575,6,"advantage if he were as ill-disposed to Valdemoro. Being prior in Avila, the latter removed the discalced friars from the Incarnation causing great scandal to the people, and he has so greatly disturbed the nuns -- the spirit of the house had been something to praise God for -- that it is heart-breaking to see. I have received word that to excuse him they are blaming themselves. Now the discalced friars have returned and, according to what has been written to me, the nuncio has given orders that none of the friars of the observance be confessor to the nuns there.
17. The grief of those nuns has deeply afflicted me, for they are given no more than bread and, on the other hand, so much disturbance that it rouses me to great pity. May God provide a remedy for everything, and may he preserve you for many years to come. Today they told me that the general of the Dominicans is coming here. If only God would give me the grace of providing an occasion for you to come, although, on the other hand, I would regret the fatigue it would cost you. And so my rest will have to wait for that eternity that has no end, where you will see what you owe me. Please God through his mercy that I will be worthy of it.
18. I commend myself to the prayers of the reverend fathers who are your companions. These subjects and daughters of yours ask for your blessing, and I ask the same for myself. Material having to do with my conscience and soul. Let no one read it even though I be dead, but give it to the Father Master Gracián.
 
IHS
 
1. In 1575, during the month of April, while I was at the foundation in Beas, it happened that the Master Friar Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios came there. I had gone to confession to him at times, but I hadn't held him in the place I had other confessors, by letting myself be completely guided by him. One day while I was eating, without any interior recollection, my soul began to be suspended and recollected in such a way that I thought some rapture was trying to come upon me; and a vision appeared with the usual quickness, like a flash of lightening.
2. It seemed to me our Lord Jesus Christ was next to me in the form in which He usually appears, and at His right side",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,2,20,2,7,10,2,1,4,7,2,6,11,2,2,0,2,2,1,0,2
"421",1575,7,"stood Master Gracián himself, and I at His left. The Lord took our right hands and joined them and told me He desired that I take this master to represent Him as long as I live, and that we both agree to everything because it was thus fitting.
3. I remained with very great assurance that the vision was from God. The remembrance of the two confessors I had gone to and followed for a long time and to whom I owed a great deal made me undecided. The remembrance of one especially made me put up strong resistance, since it seemed to me I was offending him; for I had great respect and love for him. In spite of this I felt assurance from the vision that such an action suited me, and also comfort coming from the thought that this going about consulting different minds with different opinions was now to end. For some, by not understanding me, made me suffer very much; although I never gave up any of them until either they moved away or I did, because I thought the fault was mine. Twice more the Lord returned to tell me in different words not fear since He gave Master Gracián to me. So I resolved not to do otherwise, and I made the proposal within myself to carry out the Lord's request for the rest of my life, to follow Father Gracián's opinion in everything as long as it wasn't clearly offensive to God -- and I was certain it would not be; for, according to some things I have heard, I believe he has made the same promise I have made, of doing the more perfect thing in all matters.
4. I was left with a peace and comfort so great I was amazed, and I felt certain the Lord wanted this, for it doesn't seem to me the devil could give such great peace and comfort of soul. It seems to me I remained outside myself in a way I don't know how to describe, but each time I recall this vision I again praise our Lord and remember that verse which says, Qui posuit fines suos in pace; and I want to be consumed in the praises of God.
It seems to me this promise must be for His glory, and so I again propose never to make a change.
5. The second day of Pentecost, after this resolution, while on our way to Seville, we heard Mass in a hermitage in Ecija",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,14,0,7,29,1,3,1,18,14,6,10,12,0,3,3,1,1,1,0
"422",1575,8,"and remained there for siesta. While my companions were in the hermitage and I was alone in the sacristy there, I began to think of the wonderful favor the Holy Spirit had granted me on the vigil of that feast of Pentecost. Great desires came over me to render Him a special service, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't done. I recalled that although I had made a vow of obedience, it wasn't of a kind I could obey with perfection; and the thought came to me that it would be pleasing to the Holy Spirit to promise what I had proposed in regard to the friar, Father Jerome. On the one hand it seemed to me I wouldn't be doing anything by such a promise, and on the other hand it struck me as something very arduous when I reflected that with superiors you don't reveal your interior state; and that if you don't get along well with one superior, there is finally a change, and another one comes along; and that this promise would mean remaining without any freedom either interiorly or exteriorly throughout life. And I felt pressed a little, and even very much, not to go through with it.
6. This very resistance that my thoughts caused in my will reproached me. It seemed to me there was already something presenting itself to me that I wasn't doing for God and which I had always fled. The fact is the difficulty so bothered me I don't think I did anything in my life, not even in making profession, over which I felt within myself greater resistance, except when I left my father's house to become a nun. This resistance was the reason I didn't consider my love for this Father; but rather, I then considered the matter as though it regarded a stranger. Nor did I consider his good qualities, but only whether it would be good to make this promise for the Holy Spirit. The doubts that arose as to whether or not it would be of service to God, I believe, cause me to delay.
7. At the end of the period of battle, the Lord gave me great confidence so that it seemed to me I made that promise for the Holy Spirit, and that the Spirit was obliged to give the Father light so that he in turn might give it to me. It also seemed I was to recall that it was our Lord Jesus Christ who had given me",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,17,0,5,20,1,2,1,22,10,10,15,4,0,0,5,2,2,1,0
"423",1575,9,"the light. And at this point I knelt down and promised that for the rest of my life I would do everything Master Gracián might tell me, as long as there was nothing in opposition to God or my superiors to whom I was obliged. It was my intention that this would apply only in serious matters so as to avoid scruples; for example, when I insist with Father Jerome about some trifling thing in regard to his comfort or mine, and he in turn tells me not to speak of it any more. For such insistence implies no lack of obedience or intention to hide knowingly any of my faults or sins. And not hiding these also involves more than what one is obliged to with superiors. In sum, it was my intention to hold him in the place of God, interiorly and exteriorly.
8. I don't know if I merited, but it seemed to me I did something great for the Holy Spirit, at least all I knew how; and so I remained with great satisfaction and happiness, and I have remained so since then. And although I feared I might be restricted, I was left with greater freedom; and I was more confident our Lord would grant Father Gracián new favors for this service I rendered to God and that I might share in them and receive light in everything.
Blessed be He who created a person who so pleased me that I could dare do this. 1. On the feast of St. Mary Magdalene while I was reflecting on the friendship with our Lord I'm obliged to maintain and also on the words He spoke to me about this saint, and having insistent desires to imitate her, the Lord granted me a great favor and told me that from now on I should try hard, that I was going to have to serve Him more than I did up to this point. This favor gave me the desire not to die so soon, that I might have time to be occupied in His service, and I was left with strong determination to suffer. 1. One day I was very recollected in recommending Eliseus to God. I heard, ""He is my true son, I shall not cease to help him,"" or some words to this effect which I don't remember well. 1. Since my brothers had come and I owe so much to one of them, I didn't cease being with this one and discussing what was",2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,12,1,6,26,2,0,1,8,10,9,16,5,0,3,1,0,1,0,0
"424",1575,10,"suited to his soul and state; and this all made me weary and uneasy. While offering these actions to the Lord and thinking I was thus obliged, I recalled that our constitutions tell us we should keep away from relatives. Thinking about whether I was obliged to follow these constitutions in this matter, the Lord told me: ""No, daughter, for your institutions must be in conformity with My law."" Indeed, the intention of the constitutions is that there be no attachment to relatives. And, in my opinion, it tires and wearies me more to converse with them. 1. After having received Communion on the feast of St. Augustine, I understood -- I'm unable to say how -- and almost saw (although it was something intellectual and passed quickly) how the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity, which I bear imprinted in my soul, are one. By means of the strangest painting and a very clear light, I was given an understanding that was an activity very different from merely holding this truth by faith. As a result I haven't been able to think of any of the three divine Persons without thinking of all three. Thus I was reflecting today upon how, since they were so united, the Son alone could have taken human flesh; and the Lord gave me understanding of how although they are united they are distinct. These are grandeurs which make the soul again desire to be free from this body that hinders their enjoyment. For although it seems our lowliness was not meant for understanding anything about them, the soul, without knowing how, receives incomparably greater benefit from this understanding even though it lasts only a moment -- than from many years of meditation. 1. On the feast of the Nativity of our Lady I feel special joy. When this day comes, I think it's good to renew my vows. And once while I was about to do so, the Blessed Virgin, our Lady, appeared to me through an illuminative vision; and it seems to me I renewed them in her hands and that they were pleasing to her. This vision remained with me for some days, as though she were next to me at my left. To His Sacred, Catholic, Imperial Royal Majesty, the Lord King.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your majesty, amen. I truly believe that your majesty is aware of the everyday care I take to recommend you to our Lord in my poor",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,20,0,3,18,1,0,2,20,12,4,9,10,1,1,2,3,2,1,0
"425",1575,11,"prayers. Since I am so miserable a person, this may be of small service, but by stirring the sisters of these discalced monasteries of our order to do so, I may be of some help to you; for I know that they serve our Lord. And in this house where I now reside, the same is done, together with praying for our lady the queen and for the prince -- may God give him long life. And the day in which his highness was pronounced heir, special prayers were offered. This we will do always. Thus, the more this order increases, the more your majesty will gain.
2. As a result, I dare to beg your majesty for your favor in certain matters about which the licentiate Juan de Padilla, in whom I'm confiding, will speak to you. Would you give credence to him. Seeing his true zeal, I felt confident in entrusting this affair to him. If it were made public, great harm would be done to what we are aiming after, which is all for the glory and honor of our Lord. May His Divine Majesty preserve you for many years, as many as are needed by Christendom. It is a great relief that in its trials and persecutions, our Lord God has as great a defender and help for his Church as is your majesty.
From this house of the Incarnation in Avila, 11 June 1573.
Your majesty's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. One day after having received Communion, I truly thought my soul was made one with the most sacred Body of the Lord. He appeared to me and by His presence caused me to make much progress. 1. Having spoken one day to a person who had given up a great deal for God and recalling how I had never given up anything for Him -- nor have I ever served Him in accordance with my obligation -- and considering the many favors he had bestowed on my soul, I began to grow very anxious. And the Lord said: ""You already know of the espousal between you and Me. Because of this espousal, whatever I have is yours. So I give you all the trials and sufferings I underwent, and by these means, as with something belonging to you, you can make requests of my Father."" Although I had heard we share these, now I had heard it in such a different way that it seemed I felt great dominion. The friendship in",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,18,0,3,18,2,0,1,9,10,4,11,9,1,5,2,1,1,0,0
"426",1575,12,"which this favor was granted me cannot be described here. It seemed to me the Father accepted the fact of this sharing; and since then I look very differently upon what the Lord suffered, as something belonging to me -- and it gives me great comfort. The value of good works
 
1. Once while desiring to render some service to our Lord, I was thinking about how little I was able to do for Him and I said to myself: ""Why, Lord, do You desire my works?"" He answered: ""In order to see your will, daughter."" 1. Once the Lord granted me light on a matter it pleased me to know about. Soon afterward I forgot, for I couldn't again remember what it was. And while trying to recall it I heard this: ""You already know I sometimes speak to you; don't neglect to write down what I say; for even though it may not benefit you, it can benefit others."" I was wondering whether I was to be helpful to others but on account of my sins be lost myself. He said to me: ""Have no fear."" 1. Once while I was a recollected in this company I always bear with me in my soul, God seemed so present to me that I thought of St. Peter's words: You are Christ, Son of the living God. For God was thus living in my soul. This presence is not like other visions, because it is accompanied by such living faith that one cannot doubt that the Trinity is in our souls by presence, power, and essence. It is an extremely beneficial thing to understand this truth. Since I was amazed to see such majesty in something so lowly as my soul, I heard: ""It is not lowly, daughter, for it is made in My image."" I also understood some things about why God delights to be with souls more than with other creatures. These matters were so subtle that even though my intellect understood them immediately, I shall not be able to explain them. 1. Once while with this presence of the three Persons that I carry about in my soul, I experienced so much light you couldn't doubt the living and true God was there. In this state He gave me understanding of things I didn't know how to speak of afterward. Among them was how the Person of the Son, and not the others, took flesh. As I say, I wouldn't know how to explain any",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,18,0,9,19,3,0,5,20,11,5,12,5,4,8,0,1,4,0,0
"427",1575,13,"of these things. For some of them take place so secretly in the soul that it seems the intellect understands as in the case of a person who while sleeping or half asleep thinks that what is spoken is understood within. I was reflecting upon how arduous a life this is that deprives us of being always in that wonderful company, and I said to myself, ""Lord, give me some means by which I can put up with this life."" He replied: ""Think, daughter, of how after it is finished you will not be able to serve me in ways you can now. Eat for Me and sleep for Me, and let everything you do be for Me, as though you no longer lived but I; for this is what St. Paul was speaking of."" 1. On the octave day of All Saints I spent two or three very troublesome days over the remembrance of my great sins and because of some fears of my being persecuted that had no foundation, except that false testimony was going to be raised. And all the courage I usually have for suffering left me. Although I wanted to encourage myself, and I made acts and reflected that this suffering would be very beneficial to my soul, all these actions helped me little. For the fear didn't go away, and what I felt was a vexing war. I chanced upon a letter in which my good Father refers to what St. Paul says, that God does not permit us to be tempted beyond what we can suffer. That comforted me a lot, but it wasn't enough. Rather, the next day I became sorely afflicted in seeing I was without him, since I had no one to whom I could have recourse in this tribulation. It seemed to me I was living in great loneliness, and this loneliness increased when I saw that there was no one now but him who might give me comfort and that he had to be absent most of the time, which was a great torment to me.
2. On the next night, while reading in a book a saying of St. Paul which began to console me, I was thinking of how present our Lord had previously been to me, for He had so truly seemed to be the living God. While I was thinking about this, He appeared in an intellectual vision, very deep within me, as though on the side where the heart is, and said:",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,1,8,1,11,13,2,1,6,16,8,4,13,6,2,6,1,4,5,0,1
"428",1575,14,"""Here I am, but I want you to see what little you can do without Me.""
3. I felt reassured right away, and all my fears were gone. While I was at Matins that same night, the Lord, through an intellectual vision so intense it almost seemed to be an imaginative one, placed Himself in my arms as in the painting of the fifth agony. This vision caused me great fear. For it was so clear, and He was so close to me that I wondered if it was an illusion. He told me: ""Don't be surprised by this, for My Father is with your soul in an incomparably greater union.""
This vision has so remained up till now. What I said of our Lord lasted more than a month. Now it is gone. To the Very Magnificent and Reverend Señor Padre Ordóñez of the Society of Jesus, my lord.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I would like to have a good deal of time and health to mention some things that, in my opinion, are important. But I am in such a state that, after the departure of the young lad, I got even worse than before, incomparably so. Just writing this will cost me much effort. And I get so tediously long that, however much I may want to keep this short, I will go on at length. This house of the Incarnation is noticeably bad for my health. Please God some merit will come from my being here.
2. Since this matter of ours seems to be nearing the decisive step, I have become much more concerned, especially after seeing our Father Visitator's letter today, in which he refers the matter to Padre Maestro Fray Domingo and me. He writes to transfer his powers in this regard to us. I am always apprehensive in matters in which I have to decide; it seems at once that I am going to make a mistake over the whole thing. It is true that beforehand I had recommended everything to the Lord, and they have done so here.
3. It seems to me, mi padre, that we have to look carefully at all the drawbacks, for if the thing doesn't work out, you and I will be held responsible before God and the world -- have no doubt about it. Therefore don't bother about whether the matter is concluded in more or less than fifteen days. What you say in your letter about the prioress made",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,11,0,9,14,4,1,1,13,6,6,15,6,3,2,1,1,2,0,0
"429",1575,15,"me happy, that she should not become involved in the matter except in the two areas you specified. For, believe me, it is very necessary to proceed in such a way that to achieve one good we do not remove another, as you say.
4. As for there being so many, as you often said, this has displeased me. I know there is as much difference between teaching young women together and teaching young men as there is between black and white. And if we want to do something good, there are so many disadvantages in a large number that I am not able to recount them now. I only say that the number should be fixed, and if it passes forty, that will mean too many, and things will become chaotic, with some of them disturbing others so that no good will come from it. In Toledo, I found out, there are thirty-five, and that is the limit. I tell you that in no way is it necessary or suitable to have so many young women and so much noise. And if on this account some do not want to give alms, proceed slowly, for there is no rush, and seek to form a holy community, for God will help you; we must not fail in substantial matters for the sake of alms.
5. In choosing those suitable for entering, it will also be necessary to have two other votes besides that of the prioress. One should be very careful on this point. If the prior of San Andrés accepts this task, it would not be a bad thing; he could have an administrator or be administrator himself along with another. They would take care of the record of expenditures, for the prioress should not get involved in this -- neither see it nor hear about it -- as I said before. It will be necessary to consider the qualities required of those who will be entering and the number of years they expect to remain. You and Padre Maestro could look into that; and everything you submit to him should first be presented for consultation to Father Provincial of the Society of Jesus and to Padre Baltasar Alvarez.
6. Many other things will be necessary, but we've already dealt there with some, especially not going out. Those that seem to me extremely important are the first two, for I have experience of what it is for many women to be together -- God deliver us!
7. With respect to what",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,1,4,0,7,9,1,0,2,10,0,18,12,8,4,6,0,0,3,0,0
"430",1575,16,"you say -- I think the prioress has written me concerning it -- about not getting free of the rent payment for now, you should understand that Lady Doña Jerónima cannot enter, nor do I have the authority to allow her to enter, without her first getting rid of the mortgage. Or Señora Doña Elena should assume it as a part of her estate, in such a way that the monastery doesn't waste a thing on paying rent and remains free. I know that Father Provincial gave permission only on this condition, and not to respect it would be deceptive, in my opinion. In sum, I cannot do it. I can well see how all of this is a heavy burden for Señora Doña Elena. But there's a way out: she can delay work on the church, or Señora Doña Jerónima need not enter so quickly. The latter is preferable, for she would be older.
8. The thought comes to mind that we ought not build too much on a foundation that may crumble, for we don't know if this lady will persevere. Your reverence should consider everything carefully. It makes more sense to spend a few years on the work so that it will last rather than to do something that becomes a laughingstock. And that would matter little if virtue were not discredited.
9. It is also necessary to consider, if we now accept this means, to whom we should be bound for it doesn't seem there is anything certain for the present, and Father Visitator will ask what need there is of drawing up a contract. I would have been free of considering all these things if Father Visitator had done so. Now I have to make myself into the expert I'm not.
10. I beg you to give my regards to Señor Asensio Galiano, and give him this to read. He's always doing me favors in everything, for I am most happy that my letters are now safe. This wretched health of mine makes me slip into many faults. Ana de San Pedro prizes her daughters too highly to send them there; it doesn't even enter her mind. The day after tomorrow I will leave, provided some other sickness does not strike me down, and it would have to be a serious one to keep me back. All the letters have been delivered to San Gil; no response has yet come. Tomorrow, Tuesday, I'll try to get one.
Your honor's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
Ask my Father",1,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,3,9,3,0,3,15,0,0,0,15,7,18,15,8,1,1,1,0,2,0,0
"431",1575,17,"Rector to remember me in his prayers. 1. One night I was very distressed because it had been a long time since I had heard from my Father, and he had not been well when he last wrote. My affliction though was not like it had been when I first heard of his illness; for now I had confidence, and I was never as distressed as I had been the first time. But my concern hindered my prayer. He suddenly appeared to me, and in such a way that it couldn't have been my imagination. For a light appeared in the interior of my soul, and I beheld him coming along the road, happy and with a white countenance. Although by reason of the light by which I saw he had to have a white countenance, it seems to me that so do all those who are in heaven. And I wondered if the light and brilliance that comes from our Lord makes them white. I heard: ""Tell him to begin at once without fear, for his is the victory.""
2. The day after he came, while I was praising our Lord at night for having granted me so many favors, the Lord said to me: ""What do you ask of Me, my daughter, that I do not do?"" 1. While in prayer one day, I felt my soul to be so deep in God that it didn't seem there was a world; but while immersed in Him, understanding of that Magnificat verse, et exultavit spiritus, was given to me in such a way I cannot forget it. 1. I was once thinking about their desire to suppress this monastery of discalced nuns, and of whether it was their intention little by little to put an end to them all. I heard: ""They are attempting this, but will not succeed -- on the contrary."" 1. Forty years ago this nun took the habit. And from the beginning she has turned her thoughts to the mysteries and the Passion of our Lord and to her sins without ever thinking about supernatural experiences; rather, she has thought about how quickly creatures or things come to an end. And she has spent some periods of the day reflecting on these matters without it even passing through her mind to desire anything more, for her opinion of herself has been such that she has seen that she doesn't deserve even to think about God.
2. She spent about twenty-two years in this way with",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,18,0,4,11,3,0,0,14,6,5,11,5,5,5,1,0,1,1,0
"432",1575,18,"great dryness, devoting time also to reading good books. It was eighteen years ago that she began to discuss -- about three years before the actuality -- her first monastery of discalced nuns which she founded in Avila. For, as it seemed to her, she began sometimes to receive interior locutions, and she saw some visions and experienced revelations. She never saw anything, nor has seen anything, of these visions with her bodily eyes. Rather, the representation came like a lightning flash, but it left as great an impression upon her and as many effects as it would if she had seen it with her bodily eyes, and more so.
3. She was terrified, for sometimes she didn't even dare remain alone during the day. Since she couldn't avoid the experiences no matter how much she tried, she went about terribly afflicted, fearing lest she be deceived by the devil. She began to discuss the matter with persons of the Society of Jesus, among whom were: Father Araoz who happened to go to Avila, for he was the commissary of the Society of Jesus; Father Francis, with whom she spoke twice, who had been Duke of Gandía; a provincial of the Society, named Gil González, who is now in Rome and one of the four counselors; also the present provincial of Castile, although she did not speak so much with him; Baltasar Alvarez, who is now rector in Salamanca and who was her confessor for six years; the rector at Cuenca, named Salazar; and, not for long, the rector at Segovia, named Santander; the rector at Burgos, whose name is Ripalda, who was even very unfavorable to her until she talked with him; Doctor Pablo Hernández of Toledo, who was a consultant to the Inquisition; and another, Ordóñez, who was rector at Avila. In short, wherever she went she sought out those who were most esteemed.
4. She spoke frequently with Friar Peter of Alcántara, and it was he who did a great deal for her.
5. During this time (for more than six years), she was put to the test, shed many tears, and underwent much affliction; and the greater the trials the more favors she received. Often she experienced suspension of the faculties while in prayer, and even outside of it. Many prayers were said and Masses offered that God might lead her by another path, for she had the greatest fear when she was not in prayer, although in all things touching upon the service of God she",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,0,0,11,0,8,8,4,0,2,4,5,4,10,2,6,4,2,4,1,0,0
"433",1575,19,"clearly understood there was improvement, and no vainglory or pride. On the contrary, she felt embarrassed before those who knew about the favors, and regretted speaking about these favors more than she did speaking about her sins; for it seemed to her that her confessors would laugh at her and attribute these favors to the foolish things of women.
6. It was about thirteen years ago, a little more or less, that the Bishop of Salamanca went there, for he was the Inquisitor, I believe, in Toledo and had been here. For the sake of greater assurance she arranged to speak with him and gave him an account of everything. He told her this whole matter was something that didn't belong to his office because all that she saw and understood strengthened her ever more in the Catholic faith. For she always was and is firm in the faith, and she experiences the strongest desires for the honor of God and the good of souls. These desires are such that for one soul she would allow herself to be killed many times. Since he saw she was so concerned, he told her she should write to Master Avila -- who was alive -- a long account of everything, for he was a man who understood much about prayer; and that with what he would write her, she could be at peace. She did so, and he replied giving her much assurance. Her account was of such a kind that all the learned men who saw it -- for they were her confessors -- said it was very helpful for information about spiritual things. They ordered her to make a copy and write another little book for her daughters in which she could give some counsels, for she was prioress.
7. In spite of all this, she was not without fears at times, and it seemed to her that spiritual people could be deceived as well as she. She wanted to speak with very learned men, even though they might not be given to prayer, for she only wanted to know whether all her experiences were in conformity with Sacred Scripture. And she was sometimes consoled, thinking that even though she may have deserved to be deceived because of her sins, God would not permit so many persons to be deceived since they desired to give her light.
8. With this thought in mind she began to discuss these favors with Dominican Fathers because previous to such experiences she often had these",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,1,0,3,18,2,8,19,2,2,1,16,9,14,10,11,3,5,1,0,1,0,0
"434",1575,20,"Fathers as confessors. The following are the ones whom she consulted. Friar Vicente Barrón was her confessor for a year and a half in Toledo, when she was there for a foundation, for he was consultant to the Inquisition and a very learned man. He gave her much assurance. (And all of them told her that since she didn't offend God and knew she was wretched, she had nothing to fear). The Master, Friar Domingo Báñez (who is now consultant to the Holy Office in Valladolid) was her confessor for six years, and she always kept in contact with him by letter when something new presented itself. She consulted with Master Chaves. Besides Friar Domingo Báñez, she consulted Friar Pedro Ibáñez, who was then a professor in Avila and a most learned man; and another Dominican whose name was Friar García de Toledo. She consulted the Father Master, Friar Bartolomé de Medina, who has a professor's chair at Salamanca, and who she knew had a very bad opinion of her because he had heard about these experiences. And she thought he better than anyone would tell her if she were being deceived. She consulted him a little more than two years ago when she came to Salamanca. She arranged to go to confession to him and gave him a long account of everything, and she provided that he see what she had written so that he might understand her life better. He assured her very much -- more than all of them -- and became her close friend. She also made her confession for a time to the Father Master, Friar Felipe de Meneses, when she went to Valladolid for a foundation and he was the prior or rector of that College of St. Gregory. Having heard about these things, he went with great charity to speak to her in Avila, wanting to know if she was being deceived, and pointing out that if she wasn't, there was no reason for so much criticism of her; and he was very satisfied. She also took the matter up with a Dominican provincial, named Salinas, who was a very spiritual man and a great servant of God; and with another professor, now in Segovia, named Friar Diego de Yanguas, who has a truly keen mind.
9. During so many years in which she was subject to those fears, she had the opportunity to consult with others, especially since she went to so many places for foundations. They all tested her because",2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,0,0,2,9,0,5,12,2,2,0,14,9,6,9,8,1,3,0,0,1,0,0
"435",1575,21,"they all wanted to be certain in giving her light; by this light they assured her and were assured themselves.
10. She ever was and ever is subject to all that the holy Catholic faith holds, and all her prayer and the prayer in the houses she has founded is for the increase in the faith. She used to say that if any of her experiences were to induce her to turn against the Catholic faith or the law of God, she would have no need to go in search of proof, for then she would see it was the devil.
11. She never did anything based on what she understood in prayer. Rather, if her confessor told her to do the contrary, she did it immediately, and always informed them about everything. She never believed so decidedly that an experience was from God that, no matter how much they told her it was, she would swear to the fact; although by reason of the effects and great favors that were granted her in some matters, the experience may have seemed to her to be from the good spirit. But she always desired virtues, and this desire she urged upon her nuns, saying that the most humble and mortified would be the most spiritual.
12. What she has written she gave to the Father Master, Friar Domingo Báñez, who is in Valladolid. For it is with him that she more often discusses and has discussed these experiences. She thinks he has presented her written account to the Holy Office in Madrid. In all of it she submits to the correction of the Catholic faith and of the Church. No one has blamed her, for these experiences are not within anyone's power; and our Lord doesn't ask the impossible.
13. Since an account was given to so many because of the great fear she was undergoing, many of these experiences were told around, which was for her an extraordinary torment and cross. She says that this suffering was not caused by humility but by the fear that these things would be attributed to women's fancy. She went to the extreme of not submitting herself to the judgment of any person who she thought believed that everything was from God, for she feared that then the devil would deceive both him and her. She discussed her soul more willingly with anyone who she saw was more fearful, although it also caused her grief to deal with those who completely despised these experiences -- they",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,24,1,10,13,4,2,2,12,12,14,14,20,2,3,0,0,0,0,0
"436",1575,22,"did so to try her -- for some of these seemed to her to be very much from God. And she did not want them to give definite condemnation of the experiences simply because they didn't see any reason for them. Nor did she want them to act as though everything were from God, for she understood very well that there could be some deception. For this reason it never seemed to her that she could have complete assurance where there could be danger. She tried as hard as she could not to offend God in anything and always to obey. By these two means she thought she could free herself even if her experience were from the devil.
14. From the time she began to receive supernatural experiences, her spirit was always inclined to seek what was most perfect, and it almost habitually had great desires for suffering. In persecutions -- for she experienced many -- she found consolation and a special love for her persecutors. There was a great desire for poverty and solitude, and to leave this exile so as to see God. Because of these effects and other similar ones, she began to grow calm since it seemed to her that a spirit that left these virtues in her would not be bad. And those with whom she discussed this idea agreed. However, this thought didn't make her stop fearing; but it did help her to advance with less worry. Never did her spirit persuade her to hide anything, but always to obey.
15. She never saw anything with her bodily eyes, as has been said. But what she saw was so delicate and intellectual that sometimes at the beginning she thought she had imagined it; at other times she couldn't think such a thing. Nor did she ever hear with her bodily ears -- except twice; and these times she didn't hear what was being said, nor did she know.
16. These experiences were not continual, but only came sometimes when there was a need, as once when she endured for some days certain unbearable interior torments and a disturbing inner fear about whether the devil was deceiving her, as is explained more at length in the account of her life and also of her sins, in which her sins were made public as were her other experiences. That time, her fear made her forget her worth. And while in this indescribable state of affliction, merely by hearing the words within, ""It is I, do not",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,11,0,13,15,5,2,1,17,11,13,15,13,5,6,1,4,1,1,0
"437",1575,23,"be afraid,"" the soul was left so quiet and courageous and confident that it couldn't understand where such a great blessing came from. For neither her confessor nor many learned men with many words sufficed to give her that peace and quiet that were given with these words; nor did these learned men suffice at other times, until she was strengthened by some vision. Without this strength she would have been unable to suffer such great trials, contradictions, and sicknesses, which have been without number. And it happens that she is never without some kind of suffering. There is more and less of it; but ordinarily there are always pains with much other sickness; although since she has been a nun she has been afflicted with more suffering.
17. If some service she renders the Lord or the favors He grants her suddenly come to mind, even though she frequently recalls the favors, she cannot think of them for long as she can of her sins, which are always tormenting her like foul-smelling mud. That she committed so many sins and served God so little must be the reason she is not tempted to vainglory.
18. She was never persuaded concerning any spiritual experience of hers unless it was completely clean and chaste, and there was above all a great fear of offending God our Lord and the desire to do His will in everything. This latter she begs of Him always. And in her opinion she is so determined not to turn from His will that there is nothing her confessors or superiors might tell her about what they think would be of service to God that she would fail to carry out, confident that the Lord helps those who are resolved to render Him service and glory.
19. Relative to this service, she no more thinks of herself or of her own gain than if she did not exist, insofar as she and her confessors understand concerning herself. Everything on this paper is the full truth, and your Reverence can check with her confessors if you want, and with all the persons who have dealt with her during the past twenty years. Very habitually, her spirit moves her to the praises of God; and she would want everyone to be praising Him even were this to cost her a great deal. That all be praising Him is the source of her desire for the good of souls. And upon seeing how the exterior things of this world are like",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,1,2,22,0,12,25,2,2,4,15,4,13,12,16,1,2,0,0,4,0,0
"438",1575,24,"dung, and how precious the interior are -- for the two are incomparable -- she has come to have little esteem for the things of the world.
20. The kind of vision your Reverence asked me about is a kind in which nothing is seen, neither interiorly nor exteriorly, because the vision is not an imaginative one. But without seeing anything, the soul understands who it is -- and even where the representation is -- more clearly than if it saw the person, except that nothing in particular is represented. It's as though we were to feel that another is beside us, and because it is dark don't see that person; yet certainly we know the other is there. However this comparison is insufficient, for one who is in darkness knows in some way, either by hearing a noise or having seen the person before, that someone is there, or knows it from previous knowledge. Here, there is nothing of this; but without any exterior or interior word, the soul understands most clearly who it is and where He is, and sometimes the meaning. Where these visions come from, or how, the soul doesn't know; but they happen in this way, and while they last they cannot be ignored. When one of these visions is taken away, no matter how much the soul wants to imagine it as it was, its efforts are to no avail because what it forms is seen to be something imagined and not a presence; for this presence is not in its power to produce. And so it is with all the supernatural experiences. This inability to produce them is why individuals to whom God grants such a favor don't consider themselves to be anything, for they see that their experience is a gift and that the soul can neither add nor subtract anything. And this leaves the soul with much more humility and much more love of always serving this Lord, so powerful that He can do what we cannot even understand. However much learning one may have, there are things that cannot be grasped.
May He who grants this vision be blessed forever and ever, amen. 1. Jesus be with your ladyship. I would have liked to have had more time for this letter, and thinking that I would have it today, I waited until now; for tomorrow, 19 May, I'm leaving. But I have had so much to do that no time is left. I will write through Pablo Hernández. Although I",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,11,0,1,6,0,0,0,17,9,4,17,7,7,2,1,0,0,1,0

2. I am feeling fine and each day I feel better in this town, and so do all the others. None of the sisters is dissatisfied, and every day they please me more. I tell you that of the four who have come, three experience deep prayer, and have many other gifts. They are such that you can be sure that even though I'm going away, nothing that has to do with perfection will be lost, especially considering the persons who will be here with them ... May God keep him here for many years, for with him I have no worry about anything.The parish priest kisses your hands, for he is the type -- I don't know how to say it -- who doesn't send greetings. As you directed me, I gave your greetings to him. We owe him a great deal.
3. I cannot understand why you have not yet sent Maestro Avila what I entrusted to you!Do not delay any longer, for love of the Lord, but send it right away through a messenger -- they tell me it's only a day's journey. To wait for Salazar would be foolish; if he is rector, he wouldn't be able to leave to visit you, and even less go to see Padre Avila. I beg you, if you have not sent it, to do so at once. Indeed, this has distressed me, for it seems that the devil is interfering. And the Reverend Licentiate has been a great temptation, for I had told him to bring it when he went. I believe that the devil will get mad if this saint sees it. I don't know the reason ... I beg you to send it at once and do what I asked of you in Toledo. Realize that it's more important than you think ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. May God be blessed that your letters arrived here, for I had no small desire for them. In this I see that I love you more than I do other very close relatives of mine. But your letters always seem short to me. I was greatly",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,15,0,8,17,2,1,2,13,4,6,9,7,3,1,3,1,0,3,0
"440",1575,26,"consoled that you are in good health. May the Lord give you the health I ask of him for you. I am very sorry that you have that disturbance added on to those you have by reason of your office. That illness seems to have become so common that it requires a special remedy. May it please the Lord to provide a suitable one.
2. Oh, Madre, how I have desired that you be with me during these days. You should know that in my opinion they have been the best days of my life, without exaggeration. Our Padre Gracián has been here for over twenty days. I tell you that though I have spoken with him a great deal, I have not yet come to fully grasp the worth of this man. He is without fault in my eyes, and for us better than what we would have asked God for. What you must do now, and all the nuns, is to beseech His Majesty to give him to us for our superior. In this way I could rest from the government of these houses. For I have never seen perfection combined with so much gentleness. May God lead him by the hand and protect him, for in no way would I have wanted to miss seeing him and speaking with him at such length.
3. He has been waiting for Mariano, whose delay made us very glad. Julián de Avila is all enthused about him and so is everyone else. He's a wonderful preacher. I truly believe he has made progress since you saw him, for the great trials he has undergone have benefited him very much. The Lord has so turned things around that I am leaving this coming Monday, with the Lord's help, for Seville. I am writing to Padre Fray Diego in more detail about it.
4. The fact is that this house is in Andalusia, and since Padre Maestro Gracián is provincial of Andalusia, I have discovered that I am his subject without having realized it, and as such I can be given orders by him. A situation came about that when we were ready to go to Caravaca to make a foundation and had been given the license by the Council of Orders, the license turned out to be invalid, and it was decided to go at once to Seville. I would be greatly consoled if I could bring you with me, but I see that for you to leave now would mean the",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,5,0,2,1,8,0,4,16,1,0,1,10,9,11,6,7,5,2,1,2,4,0,0

5. I think that before Padre Maestro returns here you will see him, for the nuncio has sent for him, and by the time this letter reaches you he will be in Madrid. While here, I am, and have been, in much better health than usual. How much better would it be to pass the summer with your reverence rather than in the sizzling heat of Seville. Pray for us and tell the sisters to do the same and give them my regards.
6. There will be more messengers in Seville and we will write more often; and so I'll say no more, other than that you give my regards to Father Rector and the licentiate and tell them what has been happening and ask them to pray for me. My regards to all the sisters. May God make you a saint.
Today is the feast of the Ascension.
7. San Jerónimo sends her regards. She is going to Seville with five other very talented nuns, and the one who is going to be prioress is very capable.
Your Reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
8. I don't know why there is such a hurry for Juana Bautista to make profession. Let it go for a while longer, for she is very young. But if you think otherwise and are content with her, then go ahead with it. But it doesn't seem to me a bad thing that you give her a longer probation, for she seems sickly to me. 1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your paternity, amen. Many persons love you in the Lord for having written such holy and beneficial doctrine, thanking His Majesty for giving it to you for the good of souls -- and I am one of them. And for my part I know that no amount of effort would have prevented me from seeing the one whose words console me so much, if my state in life and my being a woman had allowed it. Unable thus to see you, I had to search out persons like you for assurance against the fears in which my soul lived for some years. And since I have not merited to meet you, I am consoled that Señor Don Teutonio has ordered me to write this letter, something I wouldn't have dared to do on my own. But, trusting in obedience, I hope in our Lord that it will benefit me because you will",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,15,0,3,14,1,0,1,6,9,7,11,3,3,1,0,0,3,1,0
"442",1575,28,"at times remember to pray for me. I am in great need of prayers since I go about exposed to the eyes of the world and with little to show, nothing to verify in the least what they imagine about me.
2. If you understand these things, it will be enough that you grant me this favor and alms; for knowing so well what the world is, you can comprehend the great trial it is for someone who has lived a wretched life. This being so, I have often dared to ask our Lord to grant you a long life. May it please His Majesty to grant me this favor, and may you continue growing in holiness and in his love, amen.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
3. Señor Don Teutonio, I believe, is one of those who are deceived in my regard. He tells me he likes you very much. In recompense for this, you are obliged to visit his lordship; don't think it would be fruitless. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your lordship. Last week I wrote to you at length in the same vein in two letters, each sent in a different way, because I want the letter to reach you. Yesterday, 17 June, I received from you two letters, which I had eagerly desired, one sent in October, the other in January. Although they were not dated as recently as I would have desired, I was much consoled by them and the knowledge that you are in good health. May our Lord continue to give it to you as all your daughters in these your houses beseech him. Each day in choir we pray for you especially, and in addition all the nuns are concerned about you. Since they know of my love for you and they have no other father, they have great love for you. And this is not surprising, since we have no other good on earth. And since all the nuns are happy, they never cease being grateful to you for having encouraged us in the beginning.
2. I wrote you about the foundation in Beas and how another was being requested in Caravaca, and that the license for the latter contained so many unsuitable requirements that I did not want to proceed with it. Now they have given another license similar to that of Beas, in which the nuns are subject to you, and this will be so, God willing, for all the",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,16,0,0,19,0,0,0,9,7,8,7,6,1,1,0,2,3,3,1
"443",1575,29,"houses. I also wrote you about the reasons for which I came here to Seville to make a foundation. May our Lord be pleased to bring about my purpose in coming here, which is to rid the discalced friars of the things that provoke you. May God grant me this favor. You should know that before coming to Beas I made many inquiries to make sure it was not Andalusia. In no way would I have otherwise considered coming here, for I do not fare well with these people. And it is true that Beas is not Andalusia, but it is in the province of Andalusia. This I learned only a month after the foundation was made. Since I was here with the nuns, it seemed to me that I should not abandon the monastery. It was one of the reasons for my coming here. But my main desire is the one I wrote about to you, to understand the complicated situation of these fathers, for although they justify their cause (and indeed I don't gather from them anything else than the desire to be your true sons and not displease you), I cannot help but blame them. Now it seems they are beginning to understand that it would have been better for them to have proceeded otherwise so as not to have been troublesome to you. Mariano and I especially argued a great deal, for he is very impetuous. Gracián is like an angel, and were he alone he would have done otherwise. His coming here was by order of Fray Baltasar, who was at the time prior of Pastrana. I tell you that if you knew Gracián you would rejoice to have him as your son, and I know truly that he is, and Mariano is too.
3. This Mariano is a virtuous and penitential man and is known by all for his inventive talents, and you can be sure that he has been moved solely by zeal for God and the good of the order; but as I say, he has gone to extremes and been imprudent. I don't think there is any ambition in him, but he says many things he doesn't mean, and the devil, as you say, stirs up trouble. I have suffered very much from him at times, but since I see that he is virtuous, I pass over it. If you could hear the excuses he makes for himself, you would be satisfied. Today he told me that he wouldn't be",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,7,0,8,18,0,2,3,17,15,13,8,7,1,4,0,0,0,0,0
"444",1575,30,"at peace until he could prostrate at your feet. I already wrote to you how both of them have asked me to write to you and present their excuses, for they don't dare do so themselves. So I will say nothing here but what seems to me necessary, since I have already written you about it.
4. First you should understand for love of our Lord that I would not give a thing for all the discalced friars together if they dared even so much as to brush against your robes. This is a fact, because to cause you the least displeasure would be like striking me in the pupil of the eye. They have not seen and will not see these letters, although I have told Mariano that I know you will show them mercy if they are obedient. Gracián is not here, for the nuncio sent for him, as I wrote to you, and believe me if I saw they were disobedient, I would not either see them or listen to them; but I couldn't be any more devoted to you than they show themselves to be.
5. I will now give you my opinion and if it amounts to foolishness, please forgive me. With regard to the excommunication, this is what Gracián has now written to Mariano from Madrid: Father Provincial, Fray Angel, told him that he could not stay in the monastery because he had been excommunicated. So he stayed in his father's house. When the nuncio found out, he sent for Padre Fray Angel and scolded him very much saying that it was an affront to say that those who were in Andalusia through his orders were excommunicated and that anyone saying this should be punished. Gracián then went to the monastery, where he is now residing, and he is preaching in the city.
6. Mi padre and lord, this is not a time for excommunications. Gracián has a brother close to the king who serves as his secretary and of whom the king is very fond. And the king from what I have learned might side with the reform. The calced friars say they don't know why you treat such virtuous men in this way, and that they would like to communicate with the contemplative friars and witness their virtue, and that you by this excommunication prevent them from so doing. They say one thing to you, and here they say something else. They go to the archbishop and say they do not dare punish",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,8,0,3,15,0,2,0,9,7,13,11,3,5,9,1,2,0,1,0
"445",1575,31,"them because they will immediately have recourse to you. They are a strange lot. I see the one group and the other, and our Lord knows that I speak the truth, for I believe that the most obedient are the discalced friars, and they will continue to be so. Over there you don't see what is going on here. I see it and feel responsible for it all, for I truly know of your holiness and how fond you are of virtue. The things of the order are going so badly here, on account of our sins; and now that I have seen what is going on here, the friars in Castile seem to me to be very good. Even since I have been here something very distressing happened -- in broad daylight the police found two friars in a house of ill-fame and publicly brought them to jail. This was handled badly. I am not surprised by human weaknesses, but I would expect that more consideration be given to avoiding scandal. This happened after I wrote to you. Nonetheless, people are saying that it is good they were arrested.
7. Some friars have come to see me. They seem to be good, the prior especially, who is an excellent man. He came that I might show him the patent letters authorizing me to make the foundation. He wanted to have a copy. I asked him not to start a litigation, for he saw that I had the authority to make the foundation. For the last patent letter you sent me in Latin, after the visitators came, gives permission and says that I can make foundations everywhere. And this is the way learned men understand it, for you do not designate any house or kingdom, nor are any limits indicated; rather foundations are to be made everywhere. And it even issues a command, which made me push myself to do more than I was able, for I am old and worn out; but this all seems to me to be nothing, including the fatigue I underwent at the Incarnation. I never have good health, nor do I have any desire for it; but yes, I do have a great desire to depart from this exile, even though God gives me greater favors every day. May he be blessed for everything.
8. With regard to the calced friars who were received by the discalced friars, I have already spoken to Mariano about it. He says that Peñuela took the habit deceitfully,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,2,1,4,0,6,13,2,0,1,10,13,6,13,7,6,5,1,0,3,0,0
"446",1575,32,"for he went to Pastrana and said that the visitator here, Vargas, had given it to him, but it was found out that he had taken it on his own. For some days they have been trying to send him away, and they will certainly do so. The other friar is no longer with them. The monasteries of the discalced friars were founded by orders of the visitator, Vargas, who has the apostolic authority to do so. He holds that for this region the main tool for reform is to have houses of discalced friars. And so the nuncio sending Fray Antonio de Jesús as visitator gave him the license to be a reformer so that he could found monasteries. But he went about it in a better way, for he made no foundation without asking you. And if Teresa of Jesus had been here, perhaps this would have been carried out more carefully, for if they even considered founding a house without your permission they would have been fiercely opposed by me. And in this matter Fray Pedro Fernández, the visitator in Castile, proceeded well, and I owe him much because he was always careful not to displease you. The visitator here has given so many licenses and faculties to these Fathers, asking them to make use of them, that if you saw the powers they were given you wouldn't think they were so much at fault. Thus they say that they never wanted to accept Fray Gaspar or have his friendship -- who begged them for it -- or others; and the house they took over from the order, they later abandoned. And so they say many things in their defense, from which I see that they have not proceeded with any malice. And when I see the great trials they have undergone and the penance they do -- for I really believe they are servants of God -- it pains me to learn that you disapprove of them.
9. The monasteries were founded by the visitator, and he ordered the friars with grave precepts not to abandon them. And the nuncio gave patent letters of reformer to Gracián and gave him care of the houses of the friars as well, and you say they ought to observe what the visitator commands; and as you know, the pope says the same in the brief that suppresses the faculties of the visitators. I don't know how everything can now be undone. Besides, they tell me there are constitutions",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,1,7,1,6,11,0,1,3,9,9,10,8,4,3,5,0,0,1,0,0
"447",1575,33,"in print prescribing that in every province there should be houses of reformed friars. Whether the whole order is reformed or not is not a concern here. These reformed friars are considered to be saints, whatever may be the case. Truly they are good and live with great recollection and practice prayer. Among them are some distinguished persons, and more than twenty have taken courses -- or I don't know what they call them -- some in canon law and others in theology, and they are very talented. And in this house together with those of Granada and La Peñuela they say there are more than seventy friars, or so it seems to me I heard. I don't know what would become of all of them or how it would appear now to everybody, considering the opinion they have of them. Perhaps we would all have to pay. They are highly regarded by the king, and this archbishop says that they are the only real friars. Now to make them leave the reform (since you don't want any reformed friars) -- believe me that even though you had every reason in the world, it wouldn't seem that you did. Well, if you were to remove them from your protection, they wouldn't want this, nor would you be right in doing so, nor would it please our Lord.
I commend you to His Majesty; as a true father, forget the past and remember that you are a servant of the Blessed Virgin and that she would be displeased if you were to forsake those who by the sweat of their brow desire to bring increase to her order. Matters are now such that much careful thought ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor.
I have not forgotten the image of our Lady that you have offered me as a gift, which must be very beautiful since Señor Albornoz is pleased with it. So I beg you to give it to whomever Padre Maestro Gracián sends for it, for his reverence will take care of sending it to me.
2. I will take care of asking our Lady to keep you close to her, and Señor Albornoz as well. Since I am so far away, I don't know whether you did anything more regarding the matter you wrote to me about in Valladolid. My health is good, glory to God, and I'm faring well in this region where obedience has brought me. I desire very much",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,2,1,9,0,0,20,0,0,0,14,7,16,18,11,2,3,0,1,2,1,0
"448",1575,34,"that you will have good health and always advance along the path that you have begun in the service of our Lord.
3. May it please His Majesty that you make good progress and may he always rescue your honor from the tumult of Madrid, although nothing disturbs the one who truly loves God.
Today is 19 June. From this house of the glorious St. Joseph in Seville.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, my good founder. The muleteer did not arrive until yesterday. Please God the licentiate is sending the parcel with care, for he promised me earnestly that he would do so. I will send word again, for I have been very concerned. In the package I am sending two doubloons for the prioress and telling her to pay the rest. Now we are rich; and indeed we were never in want except when we needed something for your return.
2. The archbishop came here and did all that I requested of him. He is giving us wheat and money and showing much kindness. He wants to give us the house of Belén and the church; I don't know what we will do. Things are moving along nicely; don't be troubled. Tell this to my nuns and my sister, for I do not want to write until I have some good news to send about my brothers. You must not fail to write to us, for you know how much your letters console me.
3. I am well, as are all the sisters and the prioress. It is really hot, but the heat is easier to bear than the sun over the inn at Albino. We have an awning in the courtyard, and that helps a lot. I have already written you that a license like the one for Beas was given for the foundation in Caravaca. Since you have given your word, may you now give us the means by which we can act.
4. I assure you that if the founders do not go to bring the nuns from Segovia, nothing will be done. Until we see how matters turn out in Madrid, we cannot do anything. Our good friend Don Teutonio does very well, and it seems that the negotiations will be successful. Pray to God for him and for me. Give my regards to Mother Prioress, to Tomasina, and to San Francisco.
5. Write to me and tell me how our little rascal is, and the",3,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,2,3,12,0,3,28,1,0,1,4,8,7,9,9,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
"449",1575,35,"condition of your house, whether it remained standing, and how your housekeeper is. Give my regards to anyone you think you should, and remain with God; I already desire to see you, even were it to cost me another round of trials. May His Majesty make you as holy as I beg him to, amen.
Today is 10 July.
Your honor's unworthy daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your majesty. While much afflicted and praying to our Lord about the affairs of this holy order of our Lady and considering the great need there is that these initiatives God has taken in its regard not crumble, it occurred to me that the best safeguard for us would be that you realize what giving a solid foundation to this edifice entails; even the calced friars would benefit from the increase in numbers.
2. I have lived among them for 40 years, and, considering everything, I know clearly that if a separate province is not made for the discalced friars -- and soon -- great harm will be done, and I think it will be impossible for them to move ahead. Since this lies in your hands and I see that the Blessed Virgin, our Lady, has chosen you to support and protect her order, I have dared to write and beg you that for the love of our Lord and his glorious Mother you give orders that this separate province be formed. It is so important for the devil to hinder this project that he will raise many objections, without any of them being valid, for only blessings of every kind can come from doing this.
3. It would be most beneficial to us in our situation if you would appoint a discalced padre, named Gracián, whom I have recently come to know, to be in charge of us in our beginnings. Although he is young, I was moved to praise our Lord greatly for what he has given to that soul and for the great works he has done through him for the salvation of many souls. And so I believe that the Lord has chosen this friar to bring many blessings to our order. May our Lord so direct things that you will want to render him this service and issue the necessary commands.

Today 19 July.
Your majesty's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with you, my friend, and permit you to enjoy the presence of your brothers who, glory to the Lord, are now in Sanlúcar. Today they wrote here to Canon Cueva y Castilla asking him to inform Señor Juan de Ovalle in Alba and me in Avila, where they thought I was, of their arrival. I think they will be overjoyed to find out that I am here. But the joys of this life all come with trials so that we do not become absorbed in them. You should know that the good Jerónimo de Cepeda died like a saint in Nombre de Dios. And Pedro de Ahumada is coming, whose wife has died, according to what they have told me. There is no reason to grieve, for I knew about her life. She had practiced prayer for a long time, and her death was of the kind that left everyone amazed, according to what I was told. Lorenzo, also, lost another boy; he's bringing three children and Teresita. They are well, glory to God. I am writing them today and sending them some little things.
2. I am told they will be here within two or three days. When I think of the joy they will experience in finding me so close, it makes me joyful too. I marvel at the ways of God, that now he brings to me here those who seemed so far away. Today I have written to our Padre Gracián in Madrid, for this letter is going by that same route, which is very secure; you will have the news as soon as possible. Do not weep for him who is in heaven, but give thanks to the Lord that he has brought these others to us.
3. I don't think Señor Juan de Ovalle should start out on his journey until I speak to my brother, because the weather is difficult to bear down here and I must find out if my brother has business that will detain him here. If he will be detained a long",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,13,4,5,18,0,1,3,17,4,6,9,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,0
"451",1575,37,"while, perhaps you could come along too, and all of you could return together. I will write again soon and in the meantime will tell my brother how I have forestalled Juan de Ovalle from coming, and the weather will then become milder. Give my regards to Señor Juan de Ovalle and let this letter be for him too.
4. You ought also to know that they have given Padre Gracián authority over all the discalced friars and nuns down here and up there as well; no better thing could have happened for us. He is the ideal person as Señor Antonio Gaytán must have told you, whom you must also greet for me, and let this letter be for him too. Regards also to Mother Prioress and all the other nuns. Go and see the lady marchioness for me and tell her I am well and give Señora Doña Mayor the good news about Pedro de Ahumada's return, for it seems to me he was her devoted servant. And give everyone my best. And send this news to Mother Prioress in Salamanca and tell her that the Lord has taken to himself another sister.
5. May His Majesty preserve you for me, my lady. I already told you that I will write at length, for there are reasons for you to be joyful and at peace.	
Today is 12 August.
In this letter that I enclose now for you to send, I put the date as the 10th, but I think it's the 12th, the feast of St. Clare. If Padre Gracián should happen to pass through, show him every kindness and courtesy, as if you were showing them to me in a wonderful way.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress María Bautista.
1. Jesus be with your reverence, my daughter. It is a strange thing how almost all letters tire me except yours (excluding letters from confessors), and answering them even more so. But to receive and answer yours is refreshing. I was greatly relieved to know that your health is better. May God be blessed for everything.
2. You will have learned that my brothers arrived with the present fleet. Lorenzo de Cepeda is the one I'm fond of. And I tell you that even if he were not my brother, he would be worthy of being much loved because he is such a servant of God and so virtuous -- a very good soul. He is regaining his strength because he arrived in a very weakened state. It was",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,10,0,2,22,0,0,0,10,5,12,10,8,1,0,0,0,3,1,0
"452",1575,38,"God's providence that I happened to be here. I never cease rejoicing about this. For many things ... Well, I suffer it better. Teresita is eight or nine years old, very charming and beautiful.
3. He wants to remain here through this winter so as not to be separated from me. I have arranged for my sister and her husband to come to join him down here and that he stay in their house when he goes to Madrid where he will necessarily have to go. He has the means on which to live, but he's very tired of everything. His happiness would be to live in solitude. God is granting him many favors. Have the nuns pray that he will find a place to settle that is best ... I want to respond to your letter, for I tell you many have arrived that need an answer, especially from Medina.
4. That is the house that is always tormenting me, and now they are asking Asensio to be responsible for the major chapel so that Doña Elena can take responsibility for the church. But the nuns owe him so much and they so need to get out of that choir that I don't know what to say or who will have a place for them.
5. Although you are proud of your novice, I want you to know that if there is agreement about the other nun of whom you speak so highly, you couldn't fail to accept her, for what has been done is already very much. Don't be so particular. It is enough that she is helpful to the house. Making her wait could do her harm.
6. Believe me that where there is a question of benefit to many souls, certain considerations are of little value; it's enough to send her to a place where she is not known. And she shouldn't think she can find what she is looking for everywhere. In some houses there would be no nuns if so much attention were paid to details. At the beginning of a foundation and for other business matters, adaptations of some sort have to be made, as was the case with St. Joseph's in Avila and all the houses, and as also has to be done there, or you will be left without any nuns ... I tell you that if I had understood the situation in the beginning I would not have accepted her, but there was nothing else to do. Since you hadn't written me",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,5,4,11,0,3,15,0,0,2,14,4,14,11,6,2,3,0,0,1,0,0
"453",1575,39,"anything about it, there was no point in your disturbing the others, who knew that I had accepted her. For it was clear that I should have known whether the set number had been reached or not. Don't worry that we will not have a place for her.
7. That you think you know everything is disheartening, and you say that you are humble; and all you care about is your own little house, and you do not consider what is essential for all of them. This would create a state of unrest in which everything could come tumbling down in ruins. She was not the one I wanted to send there; I wanted to send one of Padre Olea's own relatives, and she no longer wants to go. That would be a nice state of affairs, that something be started and then left hanging because you are inflexible! No prioress has ever taken such a stance with me, nor anyone who is not prioress. I tell you that by acting in such a way you will lose my friendship.
8. You should know that I find it displeasing that you think there is no one capable of seeing things as you do; and, as I say, this comes from your being concerned about nothing but your own house, and not about what is important for many others. It is not enough for you to be free, but you must demonstrate this to others. Perhaps that nun will be holier than all. I don't know how from such a spirit you draw out so much vanity. If you were to see what is happening here as regards holding offices and selling them, and the importance given to this, you would be astonished. It is good to consider things carefully, but not with so much drive, for no one will make me believe that this arises from humility. The fault is all mine for not having found out about her from the padre himself. Since he had sent me another who was extremely good, I thought this one would be also. Nonetheless it was good to do everything that has been done because we owe him much.
9. In what concerns ... Padre Gracián ... friendship that I have, for you would be amazed at what is happening. I couldn't have done more, nor am I repentant. If you find faults in him, it will be because you have not spoken much with him and do not know him well. I tell",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,3,4,0,9,16,2,0,3,16,7,15,7,12,2,3,0,0,1,0,0
"454",1575,40,"you he is a saint and not at all impetuous, but very cautious. I already have experience of that, and one can trust in him more than in books. You say that since I have him I don't remember my Fray Domingo.They are so different from each other that I am amazed; in the former friendship the only bond is of the soul. Speaking with him is like speaking with an angel, which he is and has always been; and although the other is also, I don't know what the temptation may be -- something is very different. Blessed be God that he is better. Give him my regards.
10. Oh, what kind of life that person must be making you live who you say is worse than I, although I understand that all my fears come from the fear that you will lose your holy freedom. If I had assurance in this regard, I know that nothing, save for ingratitude, would matter to me, as is the case with the one who is there now. You should know that when I was there last I came away more assured than ever that you have nothing against me, and this did me much good, and continues to do so daily ... since this other friendship, as I say, rather gives freedom. It's something remarkably different and the submission does not come from the will but from understanding that one is doing the will of God, as I have said.
11. Why don't you tell me whether the person who approved the large book also considered the small one good. Would you mark for me any passages that should be removed, for I'm very glad they haven't burned them, and I would be very happy if the large one were preserved for when ... knowing what I know ... to benefit many souls. As for myself, what else would matter? I want the glory of my Lord and that there be many to praise him, and I certainly would want them to know my misery.
12. One of the things that make me happy to be here and willing to remain longer is that nobody has any idea of that farce about my sanctity which I was subjected to up there. This allows me to live and move about without the fear that that tower of wind is about to fall on top of me ... for a long time has passed without seeing her.
13. If something worse were to come about,",2,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,10,0,7,21,4,0,2,11,6,14,9,8,1,6,0,0,1,0,0
"455",1575,41,"I would also regret that. Give him my best regards. I tell you I have to force myself not to write to him. Have no fear that anyone will take away this friendship for it has cost too much.
14. Regarding Catalina de Jesús, Padre Gracián will have already been there, to whom I have written that he might observe her carefully. I am most consoled that it is he who will take account ...
As for the rest, I say that it is the feast of St. Augustine. I am repeating the date so that you don't have to go looking for it.
15. A candidate wants to enter who is rich and good. If she enters, we will at once look for a house. You should know that many of these sisters embroider. One who has entered does exquisite work with her hands.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
16. Guard those notebooks carefully. In some there is good material for preparing for profession and on how to deal with temptations, if there are any. Let my Casilda read them and afterward ... Have the enclosed letter brought to Doña Guiomar, for I spend my time writing to her and the letters get lost, and then she complains, with reason. I should like to write to the subprioress, Dorotea de la Cruz, but so many letters have arrived that I am tired. In one way or another I'll see that she leaves, although I cannot be persuaded ... and the submission does not come from the will but from understanding that one is doing the will of God, as I have said. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, padre mio. Since you will probably be on your way back here and this letter will not reach you in Madrid, I will not go on at length. Yesterday Father Provincial of ""those of the cloth"" was here with a master, and then the prior came, and after that another master. The previous day Fray Gaspar Nieto was here. I found that all of them are determined to obey your paternity and help you in suppressing any sinful abuses, as long as there are no extreme solutions taken in regard to other matters. I assured them from what I know of you that you will carry out your office with gentleness, and I explained to them my opinion.
2. I was not unhappy with the reply they made about the Motu. I hope in the Lord that everything will work",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,4,6,0,6,13,1,1,3,8,7,8,12,3,3,2,1,1,1,0,0
"456",1575,42,"out very well. Padre Elías feels more encouraged and at peace. I tell you that by beginning without noise and proceeding gently you will be able to accomplish much, but one shouldn't try to accomplish everything in a day. Indeed, it seems to me they are reasonable people. May they be so also up there in Castile! You should know that Macario is so terrible, from what they tell me, that I was deeply afflicted over what concerns his soul. They wrote me saying that now he has to go to Toledo. I have asked myself if he doesn't want to return to his lair because the visitation has already been made there and thus he wouldn't have to meet my Eliseo, and that wouldn't displease me until he becomes more reasonable. Surely, seeing good souls so deceived makes me fear.
3. We called in Doctor Enríquez, who is one of the most learned men in the Society of Jesus, about Teresica. He says that among other things sent to him by the Council was a declaration made by a commission of cardinals on this subject. It went like this: one cannot give the habit to anyone under 12 years of age, but a child can be reared in the monastery itself. Fray Baltasar, the Dominican, also said this. She is already here with her habit, for she looks like the house's little elf. And her father is outside himself with joy, and all the nuns are delighted with her. She has the disposition of an angel, and she is adept at entertaining in recreation, telling her stories about the Indians and her voyage by sea better than I could do. I am happy that she will not be a burden to anyone. Now I want you to see her. God has granted her a great favor and she will know how to please you. I don't think God wants this soul to be reared among the things of this world. I now see the charity you have shown me. For, besides being great in itself, it has been shown in such a way as to remove from me every scruple. And that makes it much greater.
4. It seems now that I have gained a little in charity, for although your absence is so painful for me, I would be pleased, in exchange, if you could help the Incarnation and stay another month to attend to the needs of that house. Eight days would be sufficient, if you leave",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,2,3,9,0,4,20,1,0,0,10,9,16,9,5,4,4,1,0,2,0,0
"457",1575,43,"Fray John there. I know that as things are now, if they see a man who has a good head they soon yield, even though they do a lot of shouting in the beginning. I feel great pity for them, and if the nuncio wanted to do a great work, he could do so in this way. May God provide a remedy, for he can.
5. There is no help for Laurencia from confessors as there was formerly, and since she found relief only in this, now she is without any. With what delicacy our Lord mortifies one, for the confessor that he gives to her has so many obligations that she fears she will enjoy his presence only rarely.
6. It is as hot here now as it is up there in June and even hotter. You have done well to delay. I have written to the good Padilla concerning the Incarnation. Would you please inform my Padre Olea and give him my regards. I have written three letters to him. Would you find out whether he has received them. Oh, Jesus, how little it would take to save so many souls! I am amazed at how I now desire this, for one of the things I hated most was to see you charged with that heavy task. Now it is easier for me to accept this. May God provide and protect you.
Today is 27 September.
Your paternity's unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus 
1. May Jesus be with your ladyship. Today, the feast of the Ascension, the licentiate gave me your letter. When I learned that he had come, I was very anxious, until I read it, for I wondered about its contents. Glory to our Lord that you are doing well, as is also Don Juan, and my lords.
2. As for the rest, don't worry in the least about it. But even though I say this, I myself was disturbed and told him that he had done the wrong thing. He is very confused, in my opinion; indeed, one cannot understand him. On the one hand he desires to serve and says that he loves you very much, which is true, and on the other hand he doesn't know how to behave consistently. He also suffers from a little melancholy, just as Alonso de Cabria. But what contradiction in the things of this world! He could be serving you and doesn't want to; and I, who would enjoy doing so, cannot. Things like these, and other worse things,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,11,0,12,18,5,2,3,12,4,12,11,2,2,3,6,3,0,1,0
"458",1575,44,"we as mortals have to endure. We never manage to understand the world, but we don't want to leave it.
3. I'm not surprised that you are distressed. I've already understood that you would have to suffer much, seeing that you have not the kind of temperament that gets along with everyone. But since this is for the service of the Lord, try to bear it and talk it over with this Lord, for he will not leave you alone. That the licentiate has left you will not seem bad to anyone here, but they will feel sorry for you. Try to cast aside your worries. See how much we care about your health. Mine has been very bad these past days. Were it not for all the comfort you have provided for me in this house, it would have been worse. I needed this, for with the sun along the road, the pain I was suffering when you were in Malagón increased to such a point that when I arrived in Toledo they had to bleed me twice. I wasn't able to move in bed because of the pain moving up from my shoulders to the back of my head. The next day I had to undergo a purge. And so I was delayed here eight days as of tomorrow, for I came Friday. I'm leaving in a very weakened condition -- for they drew much blood -- but feeling better. I felt very lonely when I found myself here without you, my friend. May the Lord be served by everything. Everyone has treated me very well, including Reolín. Indeed, I was delighted over how you took such care of me up here, even though you are down there. I pray fervently to the Lord for you. I am well now, although weak.
4. The priest from Malagón accompanied me; it is remarkable how indebted I am to him. Alonso de Cabria does so well under his administrator that he didn't feel like coming with me. He said that the administrator would miss him very much. Since I had such good company and he was tired from the previous trip, I did not press him. You should know that the administrator does a superb job. They say he's beyond all expectations. Alonso de Cabria never finishes praising him, and so, too, the others. Lord Don Hernando is also very happy with him.
5. Carleval has left, and I don't think he'll return ... They say that the Lord has wanted",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,7,0,2,0,9,1,15,14,2,0,5,10,6,8,3,6,2,3,5,3,7,0,0
"459",1575,45,"Alonso de Cabria to work for the monastery and that the hospital would pay the expenses. And that is true because Carleval's brother came. I tell you that I am most happy to leave him there. Other than my Padre Pablo, I don't know who I could have left that would match him. We are lucky to have him. He is a man of prayer, with deep experiences of it. He is very happy, but it's necessary to make some further provisions for him. Because I've written to you in Malagón about all this, I'll say no more. Here they tell me great things about this padre I'm speaking of.
6. The sisters are elated. We agreed to bring in a woman who is very much a teatina. The house will provide her meals -- since we must give alms we might as well do it this way -- and she will teach needlework gratis to young girls with the intent of teaching them Christian doctrine and how to serve the Lord, something highly beneficial. Padre Carleval also sent for a young man, and Huerna, as they call him, to assist them. And he and the parish priest will teach the doctrine. I hope in the Lord that this will be of great benefit. Truly, I have come away highly pleased, and may you be so also. Be assured that my absence will take nothing away from the religious observance of the house, for with the spirit of the sisters and with such a confessor, and the priest, who will not neglect them, I hope in God they will advance each day, and I don't doubt that.
7. As for the other chaplain, no one wants to tell him not to say Mass.You might write to him about it, although Padre Pablo is looking for someone to tell him, but I would not want you to forget to do so yourself. The administrator says that he will arrange things so well for him that he will be much better off than previously; but since it is he who must console him, he does not want to be the one to tell him. I beg you not to forget this. They have already given a third of the money to the licentiate; Miranda gave it to him. Send your instructions in writing about who should reimburse Miranda for these payments. May the devil not concoct a scheme that would make us lose a man like this. And he certainly will try,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,5,13,0,4,20,1,0,2,2,8,13,12,8,1,4,0,0,1,0,1
"460",1575,46,"for Miranda will do him as much harm as he possibly can. May you understand the importance of this, and not allow it.
8. I was so busy today that I didn't have time to write; now it's late into the night, and I feel very weak. I brought the lady's saddle that you kept in the fortress -- I hope you won't mind -- and I bought another good one here. I already know that you will be happy that it is a help to me on these journeys since it was there without being used. At least, I'll be traveling with something that is yours. I hope in the Lord that I shall be returning on it; and if not, I will send it to you as soon as you return.
9. I've already written to you in Malagón that I think the devil is trying to prevent Maestro Avila from seeing what I entrusted to you. I wouldn't want him to die before seeing it; that would be too much to bear. Since you are so near him, I beg you that through one of your messengers you send it to him sealed. Write to him and highly recommend it to him, for he wants to read it and will do so as soon as he can. Fray Domingo now wrote to me here that when I arrive in Avila I should send it to him by a private messenger. I'm distressed -- I don't know what to do, for, as I told you, I would be greatly harmed, if they found out. For love of our Lord, please attend to this quickly; realize that if you do, you will be rendering our Lord a service. And as a favor to me, be brave in those strange lands. Recall how our Lady and our Father St. Joseph went about in Egypt.
10. I'm going to go by way of Escalona, for the marchioness is there and she has sent for me. I told her that you had bestowed so many kindnesses on me that I didn't need anything further from her, but that I would stop to see her on the way. It will be for only half a day, if possible, no more. I'm doing this because Fray García, who promised her, urged me to do so, and I won't be going out of my way. Señor Don Hernando and Señora Doña Ana graciously came to see me, and Don Pedro Niño and Señora Doña Margarita as",1,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,1,4,1,6,12,1,0,0,8,6,14,12,0,4,0,1,0,1,1,0
"461",1575,47,"well; and other friends and various people came, some of whom tired me out. Those from your house are very recollected and solitary. Would you write to the señora directress; you now see what you owe her. I did not see her, although she sent me gifts, for I was confined to bed most of the time. I must go to see the señora prioress tomorrow before leaving, for she is insisting that I come to see her.
11. I was not going to speak about the death of my lady the Duchess of Medinaceli in case you had not heard about it. Afterward, I thought that by the time this reaches you, you will know about it. I would not want you to grieve over it, for the Lord has granted a favor to all those who truly loved her -- and granted one to her -- in that he brought her so quickly to himself; with the sickness she had, they would have seen her die a thousand deaths. Such was her ladyship's life that she will live forever, and the hope of seeing her again, you and I together, helps me to live deprived of her presence. I kiss the hands of all my lords; Antonia kisses yours. Give my best regards to Señor Don Juan; I pray for him very much. May His Majesty keep watch over you for me and and guide you always. I'm very tired, and so I'll say no more.
Your unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
12. They've already given authorization to our ""eternal padre."" That's the way it is: on the one hand I'm annoyed, and on the other I see that the Lord wants it so and that you suffer trials alone. The padre will surely write to you when he finds a messenger. I will leave this letter with Doña Francisca giving her urgent instructions. If I find someone going that way, I will write from Avila. I forgot to mention that our padre told me of a nun who is very devoted to reading and gifted in ways pleasing to him. She has no more than 200 ducats, but the nuns are so much alone and the needs of a monastery in its beginning so great that I said they should take her. I prefer having her to taking in foolish nuns, and if I could find another like her, I wouldn't take any more. May your ladyship remain with God; I'd rather not bring this to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,10,4,7,16,0,1,5,7,0,15,10,7,8,4,2,2,4,3,0
"462",1575,48,"an end, nor do I know how I'm going to bear being so far from someone to whom I'm so indebted and love so much. ... As regards the house, it is better, in my opinion, to take as prioress someone from the community than to bring in a nun from outside ...
... If the matter concerns the soul's health, priority should be given to that. But in matters concerning bodily health, there are many disadvantages that follow from such a principle. In a letter written a short time ago I mentioned many that came to mind ... 1. ... If she wants, you would be doing much good for the house by leaving her there; if she doesn't, let her come down here and she can go with the nuns as far as Malagón. But truthfully, I hope no one ever does me this favor. There is no house more in need of talented persons than Toledo. The prioress there will soon end her term of office, but I don't think there is another who would be better for that house. Although she is very ill, she is careful, and even though she is friendly with ""the cats,"" she has many virtues. If you think it a good thing, she could resign, giving as a reason the hot weather of that region that is killing her, which is evident, and another election could be held. But I don't know who could go there as prioress, for almost all of them love her so much that they wouldn't adapt easily to another, in my opinion, although there will never be lacking someone who is contentious -- that's for sure.
2. You should be careful, padre mio, in this matter, and believe that I understand women's nature better than you. In no way is it fitting that you let a prioress or subject think it is possible to transfer someone from her house except in the case of making a new foundation. And truly, even for this reason I see that this expectation does so much harm. I have often desired that the time for making foundations were to end so that all the nuns could settle down. And believe me when I tell you this truth -- and if I die, don't forget it -- that for people who are enclosed, the devil doesn't want anything else except to foster the opinion that something like a transfer is possible. There is much to say about this, for I have",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,5,0,4,2,5,21,0,1,2,10,7,21,20,9,1,1,1,1,3,2,0
"463",1575,49,"the permission from our Father General, which I asked for, since sometimes the weather will be bad for a nun and she can then be transferred to another region. Nonetheless I have afterward seen so many disadvantages in this that unless a transfer is for the good of the order I don't think it should be allowed. It is better that some die than that all be harmed.
3. There isn't any monastery that has the full number of nuns; rather some are far short of the full number, and in Segovia I believe they are three or four short, for I paid close attention to this. In Malagón I gave the prioress I don't know how many permissions to receive different nuns, warning her to be very careful, for we took some nuns away from there and left only a few. You should revoke these permissions, for it is better that they have recourse to you. And believe me, mi padre, now that I don't feel obliged, for I know the care with which you consider things, it will be a great consolation for me to be relieved of that obligation. As things stand now we can proceed with more order, but the one who had to make foundations with nothing but air at her disposal needed help from all sides and had to be obliging.
And you should believe that they gain a great deal from being attached to the Society of Jesus -- even though some mistakes might be made in this respect -- as time will tell and I will show you. At least these Fathers have been my main help and I would never fail to recognize this. I wouldn't want you to impede the nuns in Valladolid from sending something from the garden, for they have a surplus and the others are poor. And believe me, mi padre, being gracious even in trifling matters cannot be avoided with some persons. This is the only thing that seemed to me a little rigorous in the visitations, even though -- since they were made by you -- there must have been a reason.
4. Seneca is delighted and says that he has found more in his superior than he could have desired; he is giving great thanks to God. I wouldn't want to do anything else. May His Majesty keep you for many years.
5. I tell you I am angry about those falls you have; it would be good if they tied you to the saddle so",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,1,2,8,1,9,16,1,1,2,14,9,16,14,4,1,1,1,0,2,0,0
"464",1575,50,"that you couldn't fall. I don't know what kind of donkey that is, nor why you have to go ten leagues in a day, which on a pack saddle is killing. I am worried about whether you have thought of putting on more clothes, for it is now getting colder. Please God the fall didn't do you any harm. Since you are fond of helping souls, consider the harm that many would suffer by your loss of health and, for love of God, take care of yourself.
6. Elías now has less fear. The rector and Rodrigo Alvarez are very hopeful that everything will work out well. As for me, all the fear I previously had has left me, for I cannot feel it even were this my desire. My health has been wretched recently. They have purged me and I am well, better than I have been in four or five months; I got to the point where I couldn't go on.
Your paternity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Today my sister, her husband, and children arrived to see my brother Lorenzo. He had just departed for Madrid, although he left his children here and will return this winter. Afterward he will go directly to Avila. He arrived very weakened and sick; he is better now. We spoke much about your honor. Agustín remained over there.
2. Sister Beatriz de Jesús has become so fond of the prioress in Malagón that she has begged me not to transfer her, but the prioress has had bad health. May God be pleased to give her good health, for all the nuns are happy with her and with her disposition. I am not so happy with Señor Luis de Cepeda, for it would be good if at times he sent me word of himself. I received a letter from Isabel de San Pablo today. May God make them his servants, and may he preserve you for many years. I have had better health here than up there. My best regards to all the ladies there.
Today is 24 October.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I wrote the enclosed letter some days ago. This one is to beg Señor Albornoz to do me the favor of helping my nephew Gonzalo in every way he can. I would like to know that he has something to gain by my being the servant of",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,14,1,10,27,3,1,2,6,3,8,11,6,1,1,2,1,7,1,0
"465",1575,51,"your honors, and so I beg you to help me in this regard.
2. I am writing to my lady, the duchess, to ask her grace to have him removed from the list of her pages, for I think he is a grown man. And I know that Señor Albornoz can do a great deal. Since the pages live together, I have a real fear they will make him leave for some far off place, saying that he is too old to be a page. If I knew that he would be serving the Lord, it wouldn't matter to me, but the situation in Italy is dangerous. May His Majesty protect him as he can and grant you a safe delivery.
3. I was happy to learn more details from my sister about you and about that angel you have. May God preserve him for us and grant your honors what I beg of him for you. The more I look at the statue the more beautiful it seems, and the crown is lovely. I am thinking of bringing it with me when I return.
Today is the last day of October.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus Jesus. Memo of what must be done in Caravaca.
1. When your reverence arrives, set up the enclosure in your house and let no one enter. While waiting for the grilles to be put up, speak with outsiders in the place where the grilles will be erected, or at the turn, and try to have the grille put up at once.
2. It is necessary before Mass is said -- I mean before taking possession of the house -- to put up a bell and have a lawyer look at the contract in which these ladies agree to provide an income for the monastery. And show him the certified patent that you have from our most Reverend Father in virtue of which, in addition to the power of attorney given you by me, you may accept the monastery without any onus or financial obligation or anything else, for that is how it is given in the contract.
3. When the contract is agreed on -- and Padre Ambrosio will watch that everything is done correctly -- and you and those ladies have signed it, the Blessed Sacrament may be reserved.
4. Note that the license given by the king must also be noted in the contract, for I don't believe it is necessary to have a license from the bishop. The bell must be rung at Mass in",2,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,2,2,9,0,2,14,1,1,0,9,3,6,14,8,4,3,0,0,0,0,0
"466",1575,52,"order to take possession of the house. It isn't necessary to bless the church, since it isn't properly speaking a church. Once possession of the house has been taken, those ladies will be able to receive the habit whenever they so desire.
Teresa of Jesus To our Father Visitator.
1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, padre mio. Oh, if you could see how unsettled and scrupulous I am today! I tell you I am indeed wretched, and what is worse I never mend my ways. Today I told the bishop what Fray Angel had done in Alba. It didn't seem to him to amount to anything, for he asked me what harm could come from his governing these monasteries and in what way he could do us harm. I also told him something about Medina, for since they are not keeping things secret, I didn't believe it mattered. And I added that it would be good for him to know about certain things because, in my opinion, he doesn't know the nature of them. Nevertheless, I feel so scrupulous that if someone doesn't come tomorrow to hear my confession I will not receive Communion. What a nice addition to the other worries I now have concerning you.
2. I told him the rest. He had thought that Padilla had written me about it. I let him think so. He says that all the lords of the world could not make them obey unless jurisdiction were had over them, and that includes the Archbishop of Granada, to whom they are very close. He says that if they tell him something, they do so only to know whether he agrees with them, and that they don't pay any attention to what he tells them; and also that he is under no obligation to try to get them to obey and he doesn't offend anyone by not wanting to get involved, and that there is no reason for them to pay any attention to him. He says that the substance of the matter doesn't lie in such things, but that there are other means that could be appropriately used.
3. At one point I think he said that if there are censures they will obey. He didn't say this clearly, nor should any attention be paid to it, for perhaps this is just my impression. We are praying earnestly for this intention. All things considered, it would be better for them to obey so as to remove the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,3,13,0,5,9,1,1,0,17,12,14,17,7,1,7,1,0,0,0,0
"467",1575,53,"scandal being given in the city, where they must have many supporters. May God give them light.
4. You should hold off, even if they do not obey, from delivering letters of excommunication, so that they may have time to reflect. This is how I see it. You will know better because you are there; but I wouldn't want it to seem that ""you have cornered the king.""
5. He says that the friar they sent to Madrid went to Rome and did not speak to the nuncio. They must know already that they do not have a good cause.
6. Tell me how you are, for I now see that you are not without worries. Your worries are an affliction to me, and the help you get from me is my wretchedness, as you see. May God make me improve and may he watch over you.
7. Nevertheless, the bishop told me, since I told him about it -- I mean about Fray Angel because he didn't think the other things were very important -- that Fray Angel was free to do so and that I should inform the nuncio who is a higher authority. The more I think about your writing to the general and showing him all the respect you can, the better such an approach seems to be. I don't think it would appear wrong to anyone. It is already enough that things are being done against his will; one can at least write some kind words and pay some attention to him. Consider, mi padre, that we promised obedience to him and that nothing would be lost by doing what I say.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
8. My brother brought the enclosed letter. Tell me how your brother is, you never tell me anything about him; and send someone here tomorrow so to hear my confession. Not for many years have I had as much distress as I've had since this reform began, for here and there I am always saying more than I would like, without saying what I desire to say. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, amen. May God be blessed that you are in good health and the whole household as well. I greatly desire that Señor Alonso Alvarez's health will be restored, for indeed I love him tenderly in the Lord. I am praying for him and telling the sisters to do so as well, and we are also praying for you.
2. I kiss his honor's",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,16,0,5,20,3,0,1,13,11,12,15,6,4,7,0,0,3,2,0
"468",1575,54,"hands, and he may count this letter as also for him and know that wherever I am he has in me a true servant. And I beg you to tell the same to Señora Doña Francisca Ramírez. Since I receive word of all of you from Mother Prioress, I have neglected to write. And, indeed, I often have so much to do that I am not able to write. Here my health has been good, glory to God. As for the rest, I am happier when up there among Castilians; with these people down here, I don't feel comfortable.
3. I spoke to our Father Provincial about the matter you entrusted to me. He says that it would be necessary for him to be there and that since his brother has been very sick in bed for many days it isn't possible for him to do anything. I have discussed it here with others, but it seems doubtful that anything could be achieved. So, if there is a tribunal up there and you would stand to lose by any delay, do not hesitate to have recourse to it. In my own business affairs I have little luck in Madrid, even though we do all we can. May the Lord be pleased to do what he sees is necessary, for I see how important this is for us. What a hardship that with all the other trials your honors have in this affair, another one should come along.
May His Majesty watch over you and guide you by the hand, amen; and the same to Señor Alonso Alvarez.
Today is the 26th.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus be with you, my daughter, and may he give you as many good years as I ask of him. I tell you that you make me laugh when you say that on another day you will say what you think about some things. As usual you have advice to give! On the last day of the Christmas feasts, they gave me the letter that came by way of Medina, and before that the other containing one from mi padre. I have found no one through whom I could send a reply. I was overjoyed to receive the news about Señora Doña María, for since the bishop wrote that she was sick with fever, I have been very worried, and so we all have been praying much for her. Tell her this and give her my best regards. May God be blessed who",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,10,0,5,14,3,0,2,5,5,6,17,8,3,4,3,2,4,0,0
"469",1575,55,"has made her well. My regards also to her daughter and all the others.
2. The letter was written more out of devotion than a desire to fulfill an obligation. I would like to be so disposed toward him that whatever I say will be courteous. It is a strange thing that the affection I have for this other padre of ours causes me no embarrassment as though he were no person. Actually, he doesn't know that I am now writing to you. He is doing well. Oh, what trials we undergo with these reforms! There's no obedience; he has excommunicated them; there is another uproar. I tell you I have had much more suffering than happiness since he has been here; things were going much better before.
3. Were I allowed I would already be there with you, for they have notified me of the mandate of our most Reverend Padre. That is, I must choose a house and remain there permanently and make no more foundations, for I can no longer go out, because of the Council. Clearly this is due to annoyance over my having come down here. I have reached the conclusion that the mandate came at the request of the friars of the cloth. They think it will do me much harm. And it so pleases me that I doubt whether it will be granted. I would like to choose your house for some reasons that cannot be mentioned in a letter, except for one, which is that you and mi padre are there. Father Visitator has not allowed me to leave here because for now he has more authority over me than our most Reverend Father General. I don't know where it will all end up.
4. It would be very good for me now not to be involved in all the turmoil of these reforms. But the Lord does not wish to free me from these kinds of trials; they are most displeasing to me. Our padre tells me I may leave when summer comes. As for what pertains to this house -- I mean his foundation -- there is no longer any need of my presence. As for my health, clearly this region is better for my health and even in a way for my quiet since here they do not have that inflated opinion of me that they do up there. But there are other reasons why I believe it will be better for me to settle down up there; being closer",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,1,1,0,7,13,3,1,1,10,15,8,8,6,0,2,0,0,2,0,0
"470",1575,56,"to our other houses is one of them. May our Lord guide matters, for I don't think I have a personal opinion; wherever they send me I will be happy.
5. My brother has returned -- and very sick; the fever, however, is now gone. He didn't meet with success in any of his business affairs, but since his possessions here are now safe, he has more than enough to live on. In the summer he will return to Castile, for this was not the right season. He is delighted with his sister and with Juan de Ovalle -- they seek to please him and show him every courtesy -- and they are delighted with him. He stopped by here for only a moment and so I didn't say anything about that other matter, but I believe it will be necessary to do no more than mention it and he will do it. As for the children's needs, one page will be more than enough.
6. My brother says that, if the page comes here, his mother can feel assured that he will be treated as though she were with him, and if he is capable and virtuous he can study with them at San Gil, and he'll be better off than elsewhere. And as soon as I said that you desire this, Juan de Ovalle said he would take care of the matter, which made me laugh, for whatever he imagines I want, he is pleased to do. And thus I have succeeded in promoting so close a bond of friendship between my brother-in-law, his wife, and my brother that I hope in God they will gain much. My brother will not lose thereby, for he is at peace.
7. Juan de Ovalle has been extremely kind to him; the children never stop praising him. I say this because that boy, if he comes -- I mean here -- in the event that they will not be in Avila by April, there will be no one to teach him anything else but virtue. If I were able to arrange everything, I would be delighted to remove any worry from mi padre, for considering his character, I am amazed at how much he takes this to heart; God must have inspired him since the parents of the boy had no other solution. I would be very sorry if he went to Toledo. I don't know why he would rather stay there than in Madrid. I fear it won't come about. May",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,1,1,4,0,4,21,2,0,1,9,8,15,13,7,0,5,1,1,2,0,0
"471",1575,57,"God ordain whatever will be for his service, which is what is important. I am sorry for you, and my desire to stay in your house has greatly diminished. I indeed believe, as I have said, they will send me to the place where there is most need.
8. With regard to his sister, there is no use speaking about it until our padre goes there, and indeed I am afraid that in trying to free them from one expense we will get them involved in a greater one. Since she was reared there for her whole life, I don't know how she would get along here, and from what I have been half given to understand, she doesn't get along well with her sisters. What I mean is that she must be somewhat bent on having her own way. May it not be a sanctity made of melancholy! Well, our padre will look into everything and until then, nothing should be said.
9. By now you will have received my letter in which I told you that I sent a nun from here as prioress for Caravaca. The nun from your house accepted it with much joy, and so the prioress of Malagón, where she has remained, writes me that she is happy. I tell you she must be a good soul. She wrote me wanting to know about you, and she speaks much about what she owes you and speaks of you with much love. The house was founded before Christmas, as far as I know; I haven't heard anything.
10. I believe it will be good if you say nothing about the page to mi padre until I speak to my brother. Write and tell me how old he is and if he knows how to read, because it's necessary that he go with them to school. My best regards to María de la Cruz and to all, and to Dorotea. And why don't you say anything about how the chaplain is? Look after him, for he is a good man. And how is the arrangement of the room working out and do you find it satisfactory both in winter and summer? As usual, despite what you say about the subprioress, you are not more submissive.O Jesus, how we do not know ourselves! May His Majesty give us light and watch over you for me.
11. With regard to matters concerning the Incarnation, you can write to Isabel de la Cruz, for I can help much more from down",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,4,3,7,0,4,13,1,0,1,11,12,9,8,7,3,10,0,0,1,1,0
"472",1575,58,"here than from up there, and this I am doing. And I hope in God that he will give life to the pope, the king, the nuncio, and our padre for one or two years, and everything will be settled. If any of them should die we would be lost, since our most Reverend Father General is of the present mind; yet God would resolve the matter in another way. Now I am thinking of writing to him and offer to serve him more so than before, for I am very fond of him and owe him much. It grieves me greatly to see what he is doing because of bad information. Everyone here sends you their best regards.
12. The situation here is not suited to composing songs. Do you think things are going so well? Pray much for our padre, for a serious person told the archbishop today that perhaps they will kill him. They are in a state that arouses pity, and even more when one sees the offenses committed against God in this region on the part of nuns and friars. May His Majesty provide a remedy and free me from every offense, for up there I don't know ... But if God is to make some use of me, my life matters little; I would like to have many lives.
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
13. The weather is such here that I would have to go in search were I to want cold weather at night. May the Lord be praised for this. At least for my health, it is a good region, and nonetheless I do not desire to be here. My brother's becoming a friar has gone nowhere nor will it. Your paternity should not think, as I have written at other times, that wealth and all other qualifications are found together in one individual. I repeat that if I had not made adaptations -- by considering the small number of postulants entering -- you would not now have any nuns at all either for the one need or for the other. 1. Jesus be with your ladyship. I arrived here in Avila very tired on the Wednesday before Pentecost, for, as I wrote to you, I was in such a dreadful state of health that I wasn't ready for traveling. And so we journeyed at a slow pace. The priest accompanying us was a great comfort to me; he's so gracious about everything. A relative of mine is passing through;",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,3,14,3,10,14,1,3,3,9,5,14,13,6,2,1,1,1,6,1,0
"474",1576,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I was greatly relieved to learn from your letter that matters are quite different from what had been believed here. May God be blessed for everything, for Mother Prioress surprised me and I would have been displeased if she had done anything against your will. I more or less understand what moved the one who told us into thinking she was telling the truth. For me it was really difficult to believe and that is why I wrote to ask you what you had observed. Mother Prioress always tells me of how indebted she is to you, of the comfort you are to her, and the help you give her in everything.
2. As for the price of the house, I am not unhappy nor should you be. In exchange for a house being in a good locality, I never mind giving a third more than what it is worth -- and I've even ended up giving a half more. It is so important to have a monastery well located that it would be a mistake to look at the price. Considering the water and the view, I would elsewhere have very gladly paid much more than what the house cost. Glory to God that you were so successful.
3. With regard to the vicar general, you should feel no regrets, for, as you say, that is not a priority. The monastery was founded with a license from the council of the Order of Knights and a mandate from the king. If the king had not given a mandate -- he does me a great favor in this respect because of the good reputation these monasteries have -- we may have experienced what happened to the foundress of Beas. For twelve years she sought authorization to make a foundation for another religious order, not knowing about this one, and without succeeding. Nor after a monastery is founded, can it be closed down for light reasons; there is nothing to fear in this regard. Now, I believe, they will send you all the documents, except the one I mention in the letter to Señor Miguel Caja, but I will send that one to you soon. And if I do not send it, the reason will be that the bishop, as he says in a letter that arrived today, will be going there. He will go with the readiness to accept the foundation at once, for he is a good",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,6,12,0,5,23,1,0,2,12,10,10,9,6,2,2,1,0,0,0,1
"475",1576,2,"gentleman and has relatives and friends who will help me in every way, and so there is no reason to hesitate.
4. The mistake was in not letting me know immediately, for since I had so often written that I would not make the foundation without the license of the ordinary, I certainly thought that it had been given, for I would not have left without attending to this matter. Since I have mentioned here that they have an income of seven hundred ducats (as Mother Prioress has written me and also written to the bishop), the figure must be true. If a nun is received with a small dowry, it may be used to bring the income to the correct amount, if that is lacking. You should not feel sorry, for our Lord wants us to suffer something; in fact this foundation at first made me suspicious because it came about so peacefully. All the foundations, which our Lord will make great use of, afflict the devil and so there is always something for us to suffer. I rejoiced over the improved health of our sister and señora. Please God it will last for many years, and may he watch over you and Señora Doña Constanza. I kiss the hands of both your honors many times.
Today is Septuagesima Sunday.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. I wanted to be in a more restful state when writing to you. For all that I have just read and written amazes me in that I was able to do it, and so I've decided to be brief. Please God I can be.
2. With regard to my going to Valladolid, were they in their right minds when they thought I could make the choice rather than go where I was sent? Our padre spoke of Valladolid for reasons that no longer exist, and I don't believe he ever had the intention that I go there permanently; but yes, it was my desire. The nuncio has already written to me to say that I should continue making foundations as before. Our padre must have so explained matters that the two came to agree. From the time the nuncio was informed, he has been of this mind. I am determined not to make any foundations unless given orders ... now is the time when our padre will begin the visitation of the friars, for he still has not begun.
3. My brothers are causing a stir so that I might",2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,9,0,7,13,2,0,2,14,20,15,10,11,1,2,2,1,1,1,0
"476",1576,3,"return with them, especially Lorenzo. He says he will wait here until my orders come, for he thinks our padre is softening in his resistance. I only remain silent and ask the Lord to inspire his heart with that which will best fit God's plan and by which I will please the Lord the most, for this is what will make me happy. And do the same up there, I beg you. Tell this to my daughters, and may God reward them for their joy; but let them believe me and never look for happiness in things that are passing, for they will be disappointed, and tell my Casilda the same since I am not able to write to her.
4. In a letter by way of Medina that the prioress will have sent you, I mentioned that I received your letters with the money for portage. Now don't send any more portage until I tell you. With regard to Agustina, do what you have done up until now ... it is very small and when one subtracts the dowry that was given and the cost of food, it is nothing. And so her mother has written me again to assure me that the reason does not lie in this but in the desire of her daughter. I also respect this desire, and perhaps it is the true motive. If it is of God, he will enlighten us.
5. I don't know how I've left to the last speaking about my distress over the illness of mi padre. I'm afraid he did one of those penances customary during Advent, such as sleeping on the floor, for he doesn't usually suffer this illness. Make him keep his feet well covered. Indeed, this pain is not hard to put up with! Once it takes hold, it's a wretched thing and lasts for so many days. Make sure he is dressing warmly enough. Blessed be God that he is doing better. There is nothing that so stirs me to pity as this kind of severe pain, even when in my enemies ... Give him my regards and very best wishes.
6. The page is very young if he is no more than eleven years old. If he were twelve, it would be better. I would like him to know how to write before coming here, for he will have to accompany the boys to school at San Gil in Avila and begin his studies. My brother said that since this was an initiative of",3,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,7,0,9,18,2,1,3,8,9,8,8,5,1,4,3,3,4,0,1
"477",1576,4,"Padre Fray Domingo's he would accept the page even if there is no need, for I told him how indebted I am to mi padre ...
7. I would very much like to accept the lay sister for that monastery, but I don't see how. For the good Asensio has asked us to accept one of his servants, and I have to take a lay sister away from Medina so that this servant may live there. The aspirant is as holy as Estefanía and still hasn't received the habit; on the other hand, ask Alberta. If you would accept this saint there, you would be making me happy. I would bet that if Señora Doña María knew her, she would ask me for her. You could accept her in place of Doña Mariana, and I could ask our padre to find a place for the latter.
8. It's strange that you have not told me what he himself said, perhaps because he doesn't know where he will be sent. I was waiting to see how ... Do all you can to learn about her qualities. If she is good, even though we may not know where to place her, we should accept her. Here we are lacking one, and I would love to have one come from Castile. But it is so far away that I don't see how this could be done. You should know that our padre has many sisters, and they are very poor; and since the Blessed Virgin took him away from his parents whom he was supporting, it's necessary that we help them. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with you, my daughter. The mail carrier is leaving tomorrow, but because I didn't have any good news to tell you I wasn't going to write. Tonight, a little before we closed the door, they sent word to me that the man living in the house has now agreed to allow us to come the day after tomorrow, the feast of Saints Philip and James, which makes me think that the Lord is beginning to soften our trials.
2. Send this to Mother Prioress in Medina whenever you can for she will be feeling distressed over a letter I wrote to her, even though I did anything but exaggerate our trials. You should know that with the exception of the foundation of St. Joseph's everything has been a trifle in comparison with what I have suffered here. When you learn the details, you will",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,2,9,0,3,16,1,0,1,16,11,19,10,3,3,1,3,1,1,2,0
"478",1576,5,"see what I mean when I say that only through God's mercy will things turn out well for us. In fact we can say they already have. The injustices that are the common practice in this area, the deception and the duplicity are a strange thing. I tell you, there is every reason for the reputation this region has. May the Lord be blessed who draws good from everything. On seeing so many instances of this, I have been experiencing a strange joy. If my brother had not been here, we wouldn't have been able to do anything at all.
3. He has suffered very much and most willingly spent his money and supported us in everything, which makes us praise God. How right these sisters are to love him, for they received no help from others, but only more trouble. Now he is in hiding on our account, and it was lucky that he wasn't put in the prison here which is like a hell; and everything is done without justice, for they want us to pay what we do not owe and take him as surety. The only way to end this is to have recourse to Madrid, for there is no other way out, but he has been pleased to suffer something for God.
4. He is in the Carmelite monastery with our padre, on whom trials are falling like hail. Well, I have a hard time trying to hide our own from him, for these are what have tormented him most, and rightly so.
5. That you may know what I am referring to, remember the things I wrote concerning the lies which that nun who left told about us. Well, that was nothing in comparison with what she then accused us of at a most inopportune time and without any reason -- you will find out some day. Those to whom she told so much came here without warning -- and more than once -- and without cause. The source of all this became clear to us through the person who was called in. As for myself, I tell you that God granted me such a favor that I was immersed in delight. My joy surpassed my awareness of the great harm that could come to all our houses. It is a wonderful thing to have a secure conscience and to be free.
6. Her companion entered another monastery. And yesterday it was confirmed to me that this companion went out of her mind, and for no",2,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,6,12,0,8,21,0,2,2,9,6,4,11,10,2,2,1,0,0,1,0
"479",1576,6,"other reason than that she left here. See how great are the judgments of God, who stands up for the truth; and now it is clear that the accusations were all nonsense. And nonsense also was what she said of us, that we tied the hands and feet of the nuns and flogged them -- would to God all the accusations had been of that sort. On top of this very serious lie, she said a thousand other things, which made me see clearly that the Lord wanted to try us with affliction so as to bring all to a happy conclusion, as he did. Consequently, don't be sad. Rather I hope we will be able to leave soon, once the nuns have moved to their new house. The Franciscans have shown no more signs of life, and if they do after the nuns have taken possession of the house, it won't matter.
7. The nuns here are great souls, and this prioress has a courage that has amazed me -- much more courage than I have. It seems to me that my presence here has been a help to them, for the blows fall on me. She is very intelligent. I tell you that in my opinion she is perfect for Andalusia. And how necessary it was to choose well the nuns who were brought here.
I am well, although at first my health had not been good. This syrup is reinvigorating me. Our padre is ailing, but without a fever. He doesn't know that I am writing to you. Pray for him, and that God will bring us through all these affairs happily. Yes, I believe he will. Oh, what a year I've gone through here!
8. Let's come now to your counsels. With regard to the first, the title ""Don"" is given in the Indies to all those who have vassals. But when my nephews arrived here, I asked their father not to call them by that title, and I gave my reasons. He complied and they were calm and unassuming about it. When Juan de Ovalle and my sister came, my reasons were insufficient. (I don't know whether or not they were trying to defend the title of their own son.) Since my brother was not here, for he was absent a long while, and I was not with them when he arrived back, they had so many reasons in favor that all mine proved of little use. True, in Avila nothing else matters but this title,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,11,0,2,17,0,0,1,11,11,5,6,13,2,2,1,2,3,0,0
"480",1576,7,"which is a shame. And certainly, the matter touches me deeply because of what it will do to their reputation; as for mine I don't think I ever think about it, nor should it matter to you, for next to the other things they say about me, this is nothing. Out of love for you I will speak to their father again, but I don't think there is any way of changing the mind of their uncle and aunt who have become accustomed to it. I am very embarrassed every time I hear the title used.
9. As for Teresa's letter to Padilla, I don't believe she wrote to anyone except to the prioress of Medina and to you so as to bring joy to the two of you. I believe that one time she did write to him two or three words. You are convinced that I am blinded by her and my brother, and nothing can make you get this out of your head. Certainly I should be, were I different from what I am. But consider that despite all I owe him, I am happy that he was forced into hiding because he is prevented from coming here often. And it is true that he is something of a bother, although when I tell him to go because our padre or someone else is coming, he is as obliging as an angel. Not that I fail to love him dearly, for I do love him, but I would like to be alone. All of this is so, whatever others may think -- which matters little.
10. Padilla must have been joking in saying that he was visitator. I know him well. Nonetheless, he's been a great help and we owe him much. No one is without faults -- what do you want! I am highly pleased that Doña María is happy with that permission. Give her my best regards, for since it is very late I am not writing to her, and tell her I am sorry that the duchess is not with her. I see that the Lord wants her to have him alone as her company and consolation.
11. I know nothing more about Avila than what you write me. May God be with you. My regards to Casilda and all the sisters and especially to my Padre Fray Domingo. I wished very much that he would have delayed his trip to Avila until I got there; but since the Lord wills that everything be a",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,2,4,0,8,17,2,1,3,10,9,8,9,10,2,4,1,1,1,3,0
"481",1576,8,"cross, so be it. Do not neglect to write me. Don't send away that nun you say is so good. Or, maybe she would want to come here, for I would like to bring some nuns down here, if I could. Take note -- in my opinion, there is no reason to be troubled, for I believe that everything will go well.
12. Don't forget to send this to Mother Prioress in Medina and have her send it to the prioress in Salamanca, and let it be for all three of you. May God make you saints. I confess that the people in this area are not for me and that I desire to be in the land of promise, if God wills. Although if I knew I would serve him better here, I would gladly remain; although the sinful abominations that go on here are a painful affliction. You would be frightened by them. May the Lord provide a remedy.
Today is White Sunday. Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
13. Regards to my María de la Cruz and the subprioress. Read this to my María de la Cruz. Have all your nuns pray for us. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. Oh, God help me, how apt is your temperament to lead me into temptation. I tell you my virtue has to be great in order to write you this letter. And what is worse, I fear that something of your temperament will stick to mi padre, Licentiate Padilla -- may God forgive you both -- since he does not write to me or even send regards, although I am so indebted to Licentiate Padilla that however neglectful he is I cannot neglect him. So I ask you to consider this letter as meant also for him.
2. When I consider the embroilment you left me with and how unaware you are of everything, I don't know what to think except accursed be the man, et cetera. But since evil is to be repaid with good, I wanted to write this so that you will know that on the feast of St. James we will take possession of the house. And the friars have been as silent as the dead. Our padre spoke to Navarro, and he is the one who I think made them keep quiet.
3. The house is such that the sisters never cease thanking God. May he be blessed for everything. All say that what we paid was nothing and are certain that today",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,1,17,1,9,13,2,1,3,13,8,12,13,8,1,5,0,0,1,0,0
"482",1576,9,"it would cost 20,000 ducats to build. They say the site is one of the good ones in Seville. The good prior of las Cuevas came here twice -- he is delighted with the house -- and Fray Bartolomé de Aguilar came once before leaving, for I already wrote you that he was going to the chapter. It has been a great blessing that we happened to stumble upon this house, although because of the excise we got into some serious conflict. Well, I think we are going to have to pay everything. My brother had to give us a loan and he is watching over the renovation work, which relieves me of a great burden. The notary was the one who made the mistake in regard to the excise. Our padre is delighted with the house and so is everyone else. Padre Soto has serious statements to make -- he was just here -- and says that since you don't write to me, he will not write to you. The church will be set up in the entrance way; it will look very nice. Everything is turning out perfectly. All of this is in regard to the house.
4. With regard to Tostado, a friar has now come who left him in Barcelona in March. This friar carries a patent letter (for he was a conventual here), which Tostado signs as vicar general for all Spain. Cota came yesterday. He is hidden in Don Jerónimo's house, hoping that Fray Agustín Juárez will come today, according to what they say. The first two things are true, for I saw the patent letter and know that the other person is here. The information about the provincial is certain, and they say he is coming to take up his office and bringing with him a Motu from the pope which, according to what they say, leaves nothing more to be desired as far as the proposal of the calced friars goes. The prior, also, told me today that one among them in whom he has confidence assured him this was so.
5. His most illustrious lordship our archbishop, his assistant, and his public attorney are of the opinion that our padre should hide from them so that he cannot be notified of anything until the orders of the most illustrious nuncio are known, and this for many reasons they consider valid. So he is going to Castile without continuing the visitation and by a different route. This is not the time to",2,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,6,3,4,0,4,16,0,0,0,7,5,5,6,9,3,5,0,0,0,0,0
"483",1576,10,"be making visitations, for they are very agitated. May God forgive the one who cuts short so much good, although I certainly believe this is part of God's design for the sake of greater good. May it please His Majesty that they merit to make amends. As for the discalced friars, I have no doubt that they will make much progress in perfection, certain that the Lord disposes all for their greater good. Our padre appointed Evangelista, who is the prior of the Carmelite community, vicar provincial. He is now waiting for this blow. I am telling him, however, that since he is not the head, they will not notify him of anything. He has courage, and his assistant is well disposed to help him if something should happen.
6. Tomorrow the prior and the subprior of Los Remedios are going to Umbrete, for the archbishop who is there sent for them. If those two do not carry documents that would annul what the visitator has done -- and I don't think they do -- much will already be done. May the Lord direct all for his service, and may he free you from the siren's song, and also mi padre, Licentiate Padilla, whose hands my brother kisses many times and those of your reverence. I would love, infinitely, to have you here, for I believe you would be delighted to see how well things have turned out.
7. We came three days before the lieutenant left. We became great friends with him and his wife. They all gave us plenty to eat and showed us much kindness. The lieutenant says there is no better house in Seville nor a better site. I don't think one will suffer from the heat in it. The patio looks like it was made of alcorza. Now everyone enters through it -- because Mass is being said in a room until the church is constructed -- and they see the whole house. Off the inner patio there are nice rooms; we are better-off there than in the other house. The garden is delightful, the views magnificent. It cost us a lot of trouble, but I consider it all worthwhile because I would never have imagined it would be this good. Mother Prioress and all the sisters commend themselves to your prayers and those of my Padre Padilla; as I do to those of Father Provincial, Fray Angel. It amazes me how quickly the latter arrived in Madrid. May it please God that the chapter",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,2,2,8,2,9,0,4,29,1,1,1,8,9,8,11,9,4,3,1,2,0,2,1
"484",1576,11,"will result in his service, and it will if it is carried out as you say. May God watch over you despite all your faults and make you very holy. I had not thought the house was such a good one.
Today is 9 May.
8. Would you keep me informed about what is happening, for our padre is not here and I have no way of finding out about anything. I wouldn't want you to leave there without learning how all this ends. I tell you that I miss you, for you understand our affairs, and we are now proceeding with care and caution. My regards to Padre Fray Vicente and congratulations to him for his profession.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
9. Oh, the lies that circulate down here! It's enough to make you faint. Now they just told me that the visitator for the friars of the cloth is in Carmona -- that's how they refer to him -- and that in many monasteries they have given him their obedience. Nonetheless, I fear these things from Rome, for I remember the past, even though I do not think they will be to our harm but to our advantage. Those calced friars must have something up their sleeve. They wouldn't be so foolish as to come here, for they still don't know that our padre has departed; they think he is here. We are receiving many compliments and the neighbors are jubilant. I would like to see our discalced affairs brought to a conclusion, for after all the Lord won't put up with those other friars much longer; so many misfortunes will have to have an ending. Imagine what I felt, in the presence of all the religious orders and confraternities of Seville, at seeing so great a prelate on his knees in front of this poor wretched woman and refusing to rise before she gave him her blessing. 1. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. I am delighted that today a muleteer is available; it puts me at ease to know that I can write to you through so trustworthy a person. I tell you that the thought of your being back in Seville already and that they made you hasten your return fills me with anxiety. I see that the best way I could lessen my anxiety would be to be present there. When I consider that only now and then I will have news about you, I don't know",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,1,9,0,8,12,3,1,1,17,7,9,5,5,4,1,1,1,1,0,0
"485",1576,12,"how I will bear it. May God provide a remedy and grant me the great favor of seeing you free of those people.
2. I don't know why they want to inflict penalties on you and all the others when the excommunications of Padre Mariano and Father Prior were enough. I have no other relief than to see that you have Doctor Arganda. Give him my best regards. I would love to see him again. Don't forget to tell him that I beg him not to be so confident that those people will give up seeking their freedom; they will seek it even at the cost of lives, for they say they will have to do this if you return. Even if they don't go that far, it is always good to take precautions against what could come about, since you are dealing with fiery people.
3. You should know, mi padre, that you made me very happy on the day I saw you, but I would never regret your not having been present for the foolishness that went on there; for they couldn't have done otherwise had you been there, and all to the detriment of the authority of your office and person.
4. I long to know if you are well after having returned from so long a journey. For love of our Lord, try to write to me as soon as you can and find some way for sending the letters. This will be another trial, that Avila is so disorganized as to make it difficult to receive news about you, save from time to time. The letters must go by way of Madrid or Segovia, or sometimes by Toledo. Look at the roundabout ways we have to resort to and in the circumstances we now find ourselves, for even a few hours without knowing about you seemed to be a long time. Since you know this, it would be a great cruelty for you to neglect writing; and even if you cannot write at length, at least let me know about your health. May our Lord give you the good health needed for the sake of the order.
5. Let me know how things are going and if you were happy to see that the house of St. Joseph's is so perfect and has become so well known because of the festivity with which it was inaugurated. I at once saw that since it would be a restful place to live in, the Lord would not leave me",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,2,4,0,6,19,0,2,2,12,9,17,12,7,8,1,1,0,3,2,0
"486",1576,13,"there. May he be blessed forever. Here the setup of the house is bad, and because I've just come from the other one, it has seemed worse.
6. Mother Prioress is better, although not completely well. Her illness grieves me, and it would so even more if there were no hope of her getting better, for it is a dangerous illness. We would lose the best member the order has. From what she says, she has made amends for the faults that she used to have, and she will do nothing without reflection. I love her a great deal and am obligated to love her more at seeing how much she loves you and the concern she has for your health. Don't forget to pray much for her. This house, so to speak, would be lost without her.
7. I sent a messenger at once to Doña Luisa. I am waiting for her and have determined that if she does not do things well, I will arrange to have the nuns transfer to her house in Paracuellos until one is constructed here. Paracuellos is three leagues from Madrid and two from Alcalá and, as it seems to me, a very healthy place to live, for I very much wanted her to build the monastery there, but she never wanted to. I would much rather that the nuns not have to leave since they have already settled in this place and it is a place of transit. But if nothing else can be done, please God she will acquiesce and that you will approve. I will not await further authorization from you, for I believe we have it and there is no other remedy. To close the monastery as was done in Pastrana would be out of the question. Well, if she doesn't answer favorably now, I will go to Toledo to get some other persons to speak to her. I will not leave there until in one way or another this is all settled. Don't let yourself become troubled about it all.
8. I arrived in good condition. We did the right thing in deciding to come the way we did rather than in covered wagons, for I could choose the time for traveling, and my brother provided me with every comfort. He kisses your hands very much. He arrived in good health and remains so. He's a wonderful man! Would that he would leave me in Toledo and go away until matters in Andalusia are settled! He would also have",2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,7,1,8,20,0,1,3,10,5,18,11,6,1,3,1,1,5,4,0
"487",1576,14,"news from you more often, but there is no way of convincing him. Teresa came with us entertaining us along the way, and never being a burden.
9. Oh, mi padre, what a terrible thing happened to me! While we were sitting on a haystack considering ourselves lucky to have found it, next to an inn that we were unable to enter, a large salamander or lizard got in between my tunic and bare arm, and it was the mercy of God that it didn't get in somewhere else, for I think I would have died, judging from what I felt. But my brother got hold of it at once and when he threw it away, it hit Antonio Ruiz right in the mouth. The latter was most helpful along the way, and Diego also. For that, please give him the habit right away, for he is a little angel. I think he brought us a new nun whom I much prefer to Catalina whom I must bring from here. It seems she is doing better, but her anxiety to leave will ruin her health completely. You can rest assured that she was sick when she performed the good work. She says she did it to bring more honor to the order.
10. Mother Prioress sends you her best regards. She says she doesn't write you so as not to tire you. She's up and about and since she is so fond of taking care of everything and so meticulous, her return to health will be slower. When you go to our house, pay special attention to San Gabriel for me, for she was much afflicted when I left; she is an angel in her simplicity and has a very good spirit -- I owe her much.
11. You ought to give orders that the nuns should in no way offer anyone something to eat in the parlor, for this becomes a great disturbance for them. And except for you (for you are not to be included in such considerations, when there is a need), they should do so only reluctantly. I consider it worse when they do so, and this I have stated, and there are many disadvantages in their so doing. And the fact that they wouldn't have food for themselves if they did is reason enough, for the alms are few and the nuns won't say anything but go themselves without eating; and this is the least of the disadvantages. When I was there, I saw to it",1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,2,8,1,10,15,3,1,3,11,2,9,10,6,1,3,1,2,4,0,3
"488",1576,15,"that they would not be in want and that they would not use up what belonged to the monastery. Things tend to go on as in the beginning, and from such a beginning would come much harm. So, you should realize that this is very important and that it will give the nuns great consolation to know that you want them to observe the ordinances given and confirmed by Pedro Hernández{Fernández}. They are all young, and believe me, mi padre, that it is safer for them not to have dealings with the friars. I do not fear anything else in these monasteries more than that. For although now everything is holy, I know where it will all end up if this isn't ruled out from the start. And that is why I insist so much upon it. Pardon me, mi padre, and remain with God. May His Majesty watch over you for me and give me patience to endure the long time I must wait before receiving a letter from you.
12. I arrived on the second day after Pentecost; today is the following Friday. I came by way of Almodóvar. Fray Ambrosio had a big celebration for me. I am crushed over the departure of Padre Fray Baltasar for Toledo. I don't know why Padre Mariano exposes him to temptation, for even at a distance the occasions are not lacking. Please God ...
13. I got this far when the response of Doña Luisa arrived. She says she will send a very good worker this week. I am disaapointed. I forgot to tell you that in Seville Padre Fray Alonso, the subprior, troubled by the harm that it does him to stay in that house, has asked you to send him elsewhere. He is a good man; the right thing to do is give him relief. He would get on well in Almodóvar, I believe, for they have enough to eat; and since the prior is not there, it would be good to have a vicar. Fray Gregorio could take his place, and everything, I think, would proceed well. The more I speak to this padre, the more impressed I am. You will see for yourself.
14. What I ask you is that you take care of yourself. I wouldn't want you to be so negligent about yourself that everything ends in ruins. I know that Mother Prioress will take care of your needs. I will provide from up here, nor will I lack the means. I tell you this",0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,7,0,6,13,1,0,2,9,5,17,3,6,2,2,0,0,0,0,1
"489",1576,16,"so that when you need something you will ask the prioress, for she will send you money shortly and whatever you need. I don't know how many reales I left with San Gabriel; it was what I had left, which wasn't much. Take note, I wouldn't want to say anything to the other friars, which shouldn't surprise you, for it is evident that you need money, and I am worried about your being down there during the summer. This diligence to provide for you from up here does not mean that down there the prioress and subprioress and all the nuns don't care. But perhaps they will be receiving few alms, and when you see this, you will be very reluctant to accept anything.
15. Please God you are well, and may he watch over you for us. The time of your absence will pass, although badly.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and subject, 
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress María de San José, Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. Oh, how I would like to write a long letter, but since I have other letters to write, I don't have time. I told Padre Fray Gregorio to write a long letter about the whole trip. The fact is that there are not many things to report because we journeyed very well; it wasn't hot, and we arrived in good health, glory to God, the second day after Pentecost. I found Mother Prioress's condition improved, although she is not completely well. Take great care to pray for her. I've spent some enjoyable moments with her. I have kept very much in mind the change that you must still make. Please God, you will not be lacking anything.
2. For charity's sake, I beg you to write me through every means you can so that I may always know how you all are. Don't fail to write by way of Toledo, for I will inform the prioress to send the letters in due time, and perhaps I may have to stay in Toledo for a few days, for I fear that this business with Doña Luisa will demand much effort before being concluded. Pray for this. My regards to Mother Subprioress and the other sisters. Take good care of San Gabriel for me, for she was beside herself the day I left. Many regards to Garciálvarez and tell us about the lawsuit and everything else, and give us even more news about our padre if",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,5,11,0,4,19,3,0,1,8,8,10,11,9,2,1,1,0,1,0,0
"490",1576,17,"he has arrived. I am writing him with much insistence that he not allow anyone to eat in the monastery parlor -- see that you don't start something -- except for himself since he is in such need, and if this can be done without it becoming known. And even if it becomes known, there is a difference between a superior and a subject, and his health is so important to us that whatever we can do amounts to little. Mother Prioress will send some money with Padre Fray Gregorio for this and for any other need that may arise, for she is fond of him and so does this gladly. And it would be good for him to know about this, for I tell you that since you receive little in alms it could happen that you would be depriving yourselves of food so as to give it to others. I desire very much that the sisters not be troubled about anything; that they serve our Lord generously. May it please His Majesty that this be so, as I beg of him.
3. Tell Sister San Francisco to be a good historian of all that happens concerning the friars. Since I've just come from the house down there, this house now strikes me as even worse. These sisters here suffer many hardships. Teresa was a little sad on the journey, especially the first day. She said it was caused by having to leave the sisters behind. On arriving here, she felt as though she had been living with these sisters all her life. She was so happy she could hardly eat supper the day we arrived. I was delighted because I believe her affection for them is deeply rooted. I will write again through Padre Fray Gregorio. I have nothing more to say now other than ask the Lord to watch over you and make you holy so that all the nuns will be so likewise, amen.
Today is the Friday after Pentecost.
4. Give this enclosed letter to our padre personally, and if he is not there, do not send it to him unless through a very trustworthy person, which is important.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
Teresa is not writing to you because she is busy. She says she is prioress and sends you her best regards. 1. May Jesus be with your ladyship. The messenger is in such a hurry that I don't know how I'm going to manage sending you even these few lines, although my love for you is",1,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,9,0,5,15,0,0,3,8,10,10,12,3,2,3,1,0,3,1,4
"491",1576,18,"helping me find the time. Oh, my lady, how often I think of you and of your trials, and so I take care in praying to our Lord for you. May it please His Majesty to give health quickly to those lords so that I will not feel so far away from you, for if I knew you were in Toledo, I think I'd be content. I am well, glory be to God. I will go from here to Valladolid after the feast of St. Peter.
2. Remember, since I entrusted my soul to you, that you send it to me by messenger as quickly as you can, but not without a letter from that holy man, so that we may know his opinion, as we agreed in our conversation together. I'm afraid that when the presentado Fray Domingo comes, for they say he is coming this summer, I'll be caught red-handed. For love of our Lord, after that saint has seen it, send it to me, for there will be time for us to see it together when I return to Toledo. Don't worry about having Salazar see it, unless an exceptional opportunity arises, for it's more important that you send it back to me.
3. From your monastery they write me that everything is going very well and that they are making progress, and I believe it. Everyone here thinks that those sisters are so very fortunate in having such a confessor -- for they know him. They marvel and so do I at the manner in which the Lord brought him there. I think the Lord did so for the benefit of souls in that place, for they say he does much good. And this he has done wherever he has been. Surely, he is a man of God. Everyone here esteems the house in Malagón highly, and the friars are very happy. May the Lord bring me back there with you.
4. I find that the sisters here have made exceptional progress. All of them kiss your hands, and I, those of both Señor Don Juan and my ladies, for I have no time to write more. Tomorrow is the feast of St. John; we will pray fervently to him for our foundress and patroness, and for our patron.
Your ladyship's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
Unless you want them to pass through the superior, address your letters, and what I entrusted to you, here. For Mother María de San José, Carmelite and prioress of St. Joseph's in Seville.
1. May",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,17,0,2,16,2,0,0,13,4,2,8,3,3,2,2,1,1,2,0
"492",1576,19,"Jesus be with your reverence, my daughter. I tell you that if you experience some sadness over my absence, mine is greater. May the Lord make use of the many trials and the pain it cost me to leave daughters who are so dear to me. I hope that you are all well; I am in good health, glory be to God.
2. You will have already received the letters that the muleteer brought. This one will be short. I thought I would be here for some days yet, but since Sunday is the feast of St. John the Baptist, I have advanced the day of my departure, and so I have little time. Since Padre Fray Gregorio will be my messenger, I am not bothered by this.
3. I am worried that you will be pressed this year into paying the annuity, for by next year the Lord will have provided someone to pay it for you. Santángel has a sister whom Mother Prioress here praises highly and would prefer her to the one who entered. She says a dowry of 300 ducats will be given for the one who has entered (who will have completed a year in August), and that the other sister will give the same amount, with which you would be able to pay the annuity for this year. It is a small amount. But if what they say about her is true, she deserves to be accepted for nothing, so much the more because she is from this region. Speak about this to our padre, and if there is no other solution, you could accept her. The trouble is that she is only fourteen years old; for this reason I say she shouldn't be accepted unless nothing else can be done. Think about it.
4. It seems to me for many reasons that it would be good if our padre gave orders that Beatriz make her profession at once. One reason is that it would put an end to her temptations. Give my regards to her and to her mother and to all whom you see and to everyone and to Mother Subprioress and all the sisters, especially my nurse. May God watch over you for me, my daughter, and make you very holy, amen.
5. My brother wrote to all of you the other day and commends himself much to your prayers. He is more measured than Teresa, who cannot manage to love any others as much as she loves all of you. Because Mother",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,4,10,0,5,13,1,1,1,11,12,13,12,7,2,4,1,0,3,2,0
"493",1576,20,"Prioress (with whom I am definitely delighted) will be writing and Fray Gregorio will tell you the news, I'll say no more. I believe I'll be in Toledo for some days. Write to me there.
Yesterday was the feast of the Most Holy Trinity.
6. Try to get a letter from our padre for me or send a lot of news about him, for I haven't received any word about him. May God make you all saints.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
7. With regard to the nun, I have found out more; for the time being she shouldn't be considered. For Mother Prioress in Seville, María de San José.
1. May Jesus be with your reverence. I assure you that I feel the same loneliness for you that you feel for me. After I wrote the enclosed letter, I received yours. It brought me so much joy that I was deeply touched. And your requests for pardon have pleased me. On the condition that you love me as much as I love you, I pardon you for what you have done or will do. My only complaint now is about how little you wanted to be with me. But I see well that you are not at fault, and this I told Mother Prioress in Malagón. It was only that the Lord, who willed that I have so many trials in Seville, ordained that I be deprived of your company, which gave me relief. Certainly, as an exchange, so that you and the sisters were able to have some peace, I consider them worthwhile, and I would even bear many more for this purpose. And believe me, I love you much; and that since I see in you this same affection, the rest is a trifle to which you should pay no attention. But while I was down there, since I underwent the trials along with your aloofness -- while I treated you like a cherished daughter -- it was a great suffering not to find in you the same simplicity and love. But certainly with this letter of yours everything is forgotten, and my affection for you is such that I have to temper its excess by recalling the past.
2. I rejoiced infinitely in learning how well everything was done. The terms of the contract must be settled before going ahead, even though they may not offer much security for the future, for it's a hard thing to have a lawsuit on one's hands, especially in the beginning. Let's try to repay quickly",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,7,0,6,22,0,1,3,11,6,5,10,8,2,1,5,1,0,4,0
"494",1576,21,"the money advanced by my brother -- I mean the amount for the excise when the house was purchased. I am as concerned about the house in Seville as when I was there, and even more so, or at least as much. Oh, how happy your letters made him! He never stops speaking about your discretion. The letters arrived in good condition, but whenever you try to improve your handwriting it gets worse. Since he and Teresa are writing, I am not going to say anything about them. I have written to Father Prior of Las Cuevas, and today I must write to Malagón on business and to our padre, and so I don't expect to be able to write in answer to the sisters, especially since there has been no letup of visitors.
3. Because of his charity, I readily believe what you tell me about the good Garciálvarez. Give him my best regards. The letter from Father Prior made me happy. My friends do me a great favor by the way they are treating all of you. Try to get on well with them and when the opportunity arises do something, with moderation, for Mariano and Fray Antonio, for I wouldn't want you to lose their favor. May God forgive them, for the commotion that was caused concerning the other friars could have been avoided and matters resolved in another way. Our padre is very distressed. He is well, and the nuncio thought it a good thing that he had not returned down there.
4. You cannot say that I do not write you frequently. May you do the same, for I greatly enjoy your letters. I didn't know anything about what was going on there, for our padre's letters are very brief; he surely must be unable to do otherwise. May God be with you and make you very holy. Gabriela writes me that she is not well -- for I read her letter after I had written a good part of this one. She says she is suffering from pains in the stomach. Please God it is nothing serious. I don't remember whom I entrusted your care to. Let the subprioress take on this task, and see that you obey her and take care of your health for love of me. It would be infinitely painful to me were you to lose your health. May it please the Lord to grant you good health, as I beg him.

"495",1576,22,"The prioress tells me to send her regards to you. All the sisters are happy about how well things are going for you. May this always be so.
I believe I've already mentioned that today is the feast of the Visitation.
5. The priest came while I was attending Mass, and after giving his greetings, he went away. I spoke with him, and if he had stayed I would have shown him some courtesy, but he was in the company of others and so had to continue on his journey.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
6. Gabriela also writes and says that you keep the house very neat. I would love to see it now. I have not been able to look at whom the letters were from until now. I was glad to receive the one from our good padre, Garciálvarez. I will gladly write to him, and those daughters of mine will pardon me if I neglect them so as to fulfill my obligation toward their good benefactor. 	1. I wouldn't want your honor to forget this, and so I am putting it down here. I have a great fear that if you do not start now to take much care about the education of these boys, they will soon be mixing with some of the haughty crowd in Avila. It's necessary that you make them go at once to the Society, for I am writing about it to the rector as you will see. And if it seems appropriate to the good Francisco de Salcedo and to Maestro Daza, they should wear the student's biretta. Rodrigo's daughter had six children of which only one was a boy. Fortunately for the latter they always insisted on his studies, and even now he is at Salamanca. And this is true also of Don Diego de Aguila's son. Anyway, you will find out there what may be the suitable thing to do. Please God, my brothers will not allow their sons to become vain.
2. You will not be able to see much of Francisco de Salcedo or of the Maestro unless you go to their houses, for they live far from Perálvarez, and it is good to have these talks while alone. For now, don't forget that you are not to have a designated confessor or any more than the smallest number of house servants. It's better to have to increase the number in the future than to have to reduce it. I am now going to write to Valladolid to have them send",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,4,0,6,17,1,0,2,5,3,9,12,5,4,2,0,1,2,1,0
"496",1576,23,"the page. Even if the boys have to go for a while without him, it doesn't matter; for there are two of them and they can go together; I'm now writing for the page to come.
3. You are inclined and accustomed to receiving much honor. You need to mortify yourself in this respect and not listen to everybody, but follow the opinion of these two in all matters, and also of Padre Muñoz of the Society, if you think. But the opinions of the two former are enough for more serious matters and you can adhere to their views. Be careful -- sometimes we may start things that can be harmful in ways not immediately obvious. You can gain more favor from God, and even the world, by saving your money so as to give alms, and your sons will also benefit from this. For the present, I wouldn't want you to buy a mule, but an old saddle pony should be sufficient for your travels and domestic chores. There's no reason why those boys can't go around on foot. Make them study. 1. Jesus be with your reverence. You cannot say that I do not write to you often. This letter may perhaps reach you before the one I wrote three or four days ago, I believe. You should know that for now I am remaining here. My brother left the day before yesterday, and I made him take Teresa with him because I don't know whether or not they may want me to take a roundabout route, and I don't want to be burdened with the care of a child. I am well and am feeling rested after all the commotion, for despite my great love for my brother, it bothered me to see him away from his home. I don't know how long I will be staying here, for I am still looking for the best way to bring the work at Malagón to a completion.
2. I was distressed about your illness, and for you to undergo a purge at this time doesn't seem good to me. Keep me informed about your health. May our Lord grant you health as I desire and also grant it to my daughters. I urgently commend myself to the prayers of you all. Your letters delighted me. I have already answered some. I wrote today to my Gabriela and to San Francisco; they know so well how to praise one. Please God they are not lying, and the next",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,3,6,0,6,15,1,2,0,11,7,10,14,5,4,2,2,1,3,1,0
"497",1576,24,"time the one shouldn't be telling the same thing that the other is. All three told me about the octave of the Blessed Sacrament, I mean the feast. Anyway, I was not displeased, for it was a pleasure to know that the octave was observed so well. May God reward our Padre Garciálvarez. Kiss his hands for me. I wrote to him the other day.
3. My brother and I were delighted that you got the matter about the excise settled. It is extraordinary how fond he is of you, and I have been affected by it. I was also delighted with the books he sent you and for all the kind care my saintly prior takes of you. May God reward him.
4. I would like you to recount with much detail what those poor friars are doing -- I mean whether there is any way of their being pacified -- and tell me about the Franciscans. Pray for our padre, for he is weighed down with trials. Please God he was right in being so severe with those Fathers. Give my regards to Padre Fray Antonio de Jesús and to Padre Mariano and tell them I am striving to reach the perfection they have attained in not writing to me. Tell Padre Mariano that Padre Fray Baltasar and I are close friends.
5. Yesterday, Juan Díaz came here from Madrid. There is no thought of having a monastery here, because Juan Díaz is returning to Madrid. The king has given orders to our padre to have recourse to the president of the royal council and to Quiroga for the affairs of our order. Please God everything will go well. I repeat that there is a need for much prayer. Also pray for Father General who was thrown from a mule and suffered several fractures in his leg; this distressed me because he is old. Best regards to all my friends, both men and women. Have them do what is indicated on the enclosed paper.
6. Oh, how pleased I am with the tunics I made from the sheets! They say here that it is like wearing linen. May God make you all saints, and give you health. Look after yourself, for it is better to cater to yourself than to be sick.
Today is 11 June.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 	1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. Oh, what a long fifteen days these have been! Blessed be God that you are well; I was",1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,0,1,18,0,3,25,1,0,1,4,7,3,4,7,1,1,1,2,2,1,1
"498",1576,25,"greatly consoled. From what you tell me about your servants and the house, I don't think there is anything excessive. I had a good laugh over the master of ceremonies, and I assure you I found it very amusing. You can really trust her since she is a good and wise person. Give her my fond regards when you see her, for I owe her much, and also to Francisco de Salcedo.
2. I am very sorry about your ailment. The cold will soon begin to bother you. I am better than I have been in years, in my opinion. I have a very lovely little cell, well set apart and with a window looking out into the garden, and not many visitors to take up my time. If I didn't have to write these letters and if there were not so many, I would be so well-off that the condition wouldn't last, for that is what usually happens when things go well for me. If you were here I would lack nothing, but if God favors me by granting you health, the separation can be easily endured. May God reward you for your concern about my health, for my sorrow was relieved when I saw that you are also suffering because of my staying here. I hope in God that I will not have to stay so long and that I can get to Avila by the time the cold weather starts there. Despite the harm the cold can do me, I would not avoid it or delay here one day, for when God so wills he can give us good health anywhere. Oh, how much more for my own happiness do I desire that you be in good health! May God grant it to you, as he can.
3. Juan de Ovalle has written me a long letter in which he insists on how fond he is of you and what he would do to serve you. His only fault was to believe that you favored Cimbrón who he thought had complete control over you; and that was the reason my sister didn't come. Those were feelings of jealousy, I certainly think, for he has a jealous temperament and I suffered much from him because of my friendship with Doña Guiomar. All his complaining is about Cimbrón. In certain matters, he's very childish. He behaved much better in Seville where he showed you much love, and so you should bear up with him for love of God.
4. I",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,6,0,11,28,1,3,3,7,7,13,12,5,3,0,4,0,4,2,0
"499",1576,26,"wrote to him telling him what I thought and that I saw how much you loved him and that he ought rather to rejoice that Cimbrón was looking after your concerns; and I strongly urged him to try to please you and send you the money if you ask for it, and I added that each one is better off in his own house, that God perhaps had so ordained, and I blamed him and excused Perálvarez. The trouble is that I think he has to come here and that all my efforts to prevent him from coming will have served for naught. Certainly I feel very sorry for my sister, and so we have to suffer much. With regard to you, I swear his desire to please you and serve you is great. God has not given him more. But he has endowed others with the good dispositions needed to put up with him, and this is what you will have to do.
5. The agnusdei is in the little chest, I think; if not, it is in the trunk with the rings. I am telling the subprioress to send the chest to you so that you might take out the papers on the Foundations and send them back to the subprioress in a sealed wrapping. They have to send us I don't know what for my companion and also my mantle, which we had sent them in a hurry. I don't know what other papers are in there, but I wouldn't want anyone to see them, and so I would like you to take them out (for it doesn't matter to me if you see them), and the same holds true for the Foundations.
6. The key for the little chest broke. Force the chest open and keep it in another larger chest until a key is made for it. In the little chest is a key for a mail pouch that I am sending you, for also in it are some papers, I think, on matters concerning prayer. Feel free to read them and take out the paper on which some details about the foundation of Alba are written. Send it to me with the other papers because Father Visitator has asked me to finish writing the Foundations, and I need these papers to know what I have already written and about Alba. It's hard for me to have to take up this task, for the time that I have left after tending to letter-writing, I would",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,1,2,3,0,5,11,0,1,2,9,8,12,8,3,4,1,3,6,0,1,0
"500",1576,27,"like to spend in solitude and rest. It doesn't seem God wants this. May the Lord be pleased to make use of this work.
7. You ought to know that the prioress of Valladolid has written me that Doña María de Mendoza had a copy made of the book the bishop once had, and that he has the copy in his possession. I was delighted for your sake, because when I come we can arrange to have you see it. Don't tell anyone. If he should happen to go there, you could feel free to ask him for it.
8. I will write what you say to Seville, for I don't know if the letter was received. Why bother about four reales? Either they were not enclosed in the letter, or the carrier knowing that something was enclosed did not deliver it to them. The prioress here is in much better health than usual; she and all the sisters kiss your hands. We have prayed much for your health. I am sending you some quinces so that your housekeeper may make them into preserves and you can eat them after your meal, and also a box of marmalade, and another for the subprioress at St. Joseph's who, they tell me, is very weak. Tell her to eat it, and I beg you not to give any of yours to anyone but eat it for love of me. And when you finish it, let me know, for it is inexpensive here and I'm not using money from the monastery. Padre Gracián gave me orders under obedience to continue doing as I usually do, for what I had was not for me but for the order. On the one hand I have regretted this; on the other, since there are so many expenses to meet here, even if it involve no more than postage, I rejoiced. It pains me that postage costs so much, and there are many other things to pay for ... 1. ... Seculars in matters of self-interest pay little attention to reason. So it is with this mother prioress who, accustomed to the abundance possessed in Pastrana, has little poverty of spirit left. This is a cause of suffering to me and it will be wherever I find such a lack. For, glory to God, these houses were founded by trusting solely in Him. So I fear that by beginning to place our trust in human means, we will lose some of the divine means. I do not",3,3,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4,1,2,9,8,0,7,12,1,1,3,11,12,9,14,1,1,1,3,2,4,2,4
"501",1576,28,"say this in regard to the present matter, but I know that he would not have placed his daughter there if the spirit of poverty were lacking. We owe him, then, so little that it must be the will of God.
On Making the Visitation came as though taught by God. May He be blessed for everything.
2. Your paternity has no need to give me an order, for I consider the order already given and will carry it out. And, to tell the truth, I will be happy not to have to bother with such tiring matters. The only thing is that I fear that in some houses there is more greed than I would like. And please God they will not deceive you more than they do me. I think I am hurt more by this than anything else. And insofar as I know, I was determined that, even were you not the superior, I would not receive anyone without telling you about it, if you were close by, or even, I believe, far away. It's impossible to succeed in every instance. Time will tell. And if we go looking for dowries, we will be even worse.
3. Enclosed is the information from the prioress. When I am well informed, it serves for the good of the houses and their affairs. I don't know how they can say this. May God take care of it and give us light so that from now on we may succeed. But how many excuses I'm making. What is worse, I am really put to the test with the one I mentioned ... 1. ... Now I want to tell your paternity something, because the messenger is a person I can trust. You already know how Angela took for her confessor the prior of La Sisla, for she believes that in many matters one cannot be without someone to consult. She wouldn't feel sure she was doing right nor would she be at peace. The said person began to see her often, but afterward he almost never came. The prioress and I could not discover the reason for this. Once while the unhappy Angela was speaking to Joseph, He told her that He was the one who held him back, that Doctor Velázquez was better for her since he was learned in canon law and highly educated and that in this way she would find some relief, that He would move him to listen to her and understand (for he hesitated since he",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,3,7,0,8,17,2,2,2,18,9,16,16,7,2,5,1,0,2,0,0
"502",1576,29,"is very busy). And since Joseph is so serious a person as you well know, and he counseled her in similar ways before, she didn't know what to do, having already begun with someone else to whom she owed so much. On the other hand she feared displeasing Joseph.
2. She remained thus undecided for several days, and it was a trial for her not to be able to get your opinion, fearing she might lose her peace by consulting with so many. Padre Salazar then came and she decided to do whatever he might say however much the change would cost her, and she almost complained to Joseph for not having informed her earlier. She told Padre Salazar about everything that was happening. He had been the one who had previously counseled her about the prior of La Sisla. She can discuss everything with Padre Salazar, as you are aware, because he already knows about it all. He told her to do what Joseph said. And this was done, and what Joseph said is being realized. First, that the prior came here and that when the prioress asked him why he was acting in this way, he answered that he did not know, that there was nothing he desired more than to come and that he saw clearly that afterward he would regret not coming. He was not master of himself in this regard nor could he do anything else and he was astonished at his powerlessness.
3. Second, that hardly was it mentioned one day to the other person when he said that no matter how busy he was, he would come every week, and was as happy as if he had been offered the archbishopric of Toledo (although I don't think he would be so happy over the latter since he is so good). Fray Hernando de Medina will tell you about him; don't forget to ask him. That you may see how he is accepting the task, I am sending you this note, for I had contacted him over some doubts I had, which I will not mention since it would take too long; they did not concern prayer.
4. So it is, mi padre, that Angela is very happy to have him as her confessor, so much the more since after having met Paul, her soul was unable to find comfort or happiness with anyone. Now, although not as much as with Paul, she feels settled and satisfied, and her soul is disposed to obey him.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,2,4,0,7,10,3,0,2,14,11,9,14,5,2,4,2,1,0,0,0
"503",1576,30,"It is the greatest relief for her. For accustomed all her life to obeying, and being without Paul, nothing she did satisfied her, nor did she think she was doing right; and even if she wanted to she was not able to submit to another. Believe me, he who was at work in the first instance was so also in the second. For she is as amazed by this new condition as was the prior at feeling himself prevented from doing what he wanted.
5. I tell you that you can rejoice if you desire to give some comfort to Angela. It's enough that she is not as happy as with Paul, for her soul has no other comfort. He was not ignorant of the friendship Joseph had with her, for he had heard a great deal, nor was he surprised. Since he is so learned, he backs everything up with sacred scripture. This affords the poor soul the greatest comfort, for in all ways God has banished from her everything she loves. May he be blessed forever.
6. What we must be careful about now is to prevent the prior from finding out. We can let him think that because of his delays about coming I also at times confess with the other person and that you have informed me that I should do what I am told as though it were being told to me by you for the good of my soul. For I assure you that the desires and impulses this woman has to do something for God are so great that now that she cannot do great works, she needs to find out how she can please God more in what she can do.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. Today I sent you some letters through the chief courier. You must not forget to tell me whether you receive them. I believe they will surely arrive in Seville, for he is a brother of one of our nuns.
2. I told you that Tostado left for Portugal the day you arrived here. Infante and another preacher from Andalusia were waiting for him and sent a messenger to Madrid who brought them back this news. Blessed be the Lord who has so ordained.
3. You should know that the members of the Council say that if they are to give the license on the basis of the usual procedure, they cannot do so, for",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,18,0,1,21,0,0,0,11,5,12,7,9,0,2,1,0,1,1,0
"504",1576,31,"we need to have more convincing reasons. If they see a letter from the nuncio saying that he grants it, they will give it without further discussion. This information was given by a magistrate friend to Don Pedro González. Write to me through those returning from the chapter about what we can do and whether it would be good to seek counsel from someone in Madrid, like the duke or others.
4. I have begun to suspect they have impeded him with letters from Rome from giving these permissions, for he gave them to Padre Fray Antonio easily, it seems to me. I have also been thinking that if they give this false information to the pope, and there is no one there to counter it, they will get as many briefs as they want against us, and that it is most important that we have some of our friars there. When it is seen how our own live, the prejudice of the others will become obvious. I don't think we ought to do anything until that moment comes. Then our friars can bring back the authorization to found a few houses. Believe me, it's very important to be prepared for what may come about.
5. I am writing this in a hurry and so cannot say any more than that everyone recommends themselves to your prayers; and I to the prayers of all the Fathers there, especially Father Prior of Los Remedios, although I'm angry with him. I want to know if Padre Mariano came. May God watch over you and lead you by his hand, amen.
6. I am overjoyed to see what nice weather it is for traveling. I am waiting for Antonio. Don't forget to write to tell me the name of the man to whom I must send the letters going to Madrid, that servant of your father's. Be careful not to forget, and tell me how to address the envelope and if he is someone who should be reimbursed for the postage.
Today is 5 September.
7. We are well and it seems I'm feeling somewhat relieved to see that it is easier to write to you from here.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
8. Be careful, mi padre, not to lose the paper I gave you, for you said you would place it in the lining but you did not do so. I would like you to keep a copy of it in your little coffer, for many complications would arise if it were lost.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,1,6,0,4,15,0,2,2,14,4,15,17,3,5,3,2,1,0,0,0
"505",1576,32,"1. Jesus be with your paternity. The carrier of this letter has just arrived, but he is allowing me little time, and so I can say no more than what's needed. I praise the Lord you arrived in good health. I have sent you letters by two different routes, informing you that Peralta left for Portugal on the same Thursday that you arrived here. Santelmo wrote me today -- and I am enclosing his letter -- that we have nothing to fear, that Methuselah is determined to grant our desire of separating out the eagles, for he sees clearly that this is the fitting thing to do.
2. I received a letter today from Seville about the excitement and enthusiasm aroused down there by the news concerning Peralta and how the whole town is being told that the butterflies will have to submit to him. Indeed, what the Lord has done is fitting. May he be blessed forever. Infante came to speak to me; he wanted a letter for Paul. I told him that Paul wouldn't do anything for me, that he should speak to him himself. He doesn't think he is at fault. I believe that if he had any hope for the return of Peralta, he wouldn't be so submissive.
3. In regard to what you say about the prioress of Malagón, I have already written to you about that. In a matter so serious you ought not leave the decision to me, so much more so because in knowing your desire I would not in conscience be able to oppose it. So I beg you to do what you think best, and consider who you think would make a good prioress there. She would have to have more capabilities than is required for subprioress. I can't think of anyone other than the prioress of Salamanca. I don't know the one you mention and she is still new. The other one mentioned would function very poorly in the role of prioress. This distresses me. Recommend this intention to God and give orders about what to do. The actual circumstances make it difficult to transfer nuns. May the Lord direct things, for necessity has no law.
Today is Thursday, 6 September.
I have no time to write to my Padre Fray Antonio or say anything more.
Your paternity's servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 10. When I heard about this matter, I was closer to you, for in May I left that place for where I am now. Our Lord, who so ordained",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,10,0,6,9,2,0,0,11,6,14,10,4,1,6,0,1,1,1,0
"506",1576,33,"things, must have known this to be better. By leaving everything in his hands -- your desires and mine, since all must be directed to his glory -- the Lord will ordain that what is for the best will come about.
11. I am sending through this messenger a request to the licentiate Juan Bautista, who is the priest in Malagón, that he pay you a visit. During the time I was there, he was most gracious and helped in everything, both spiritual and temporal, for the Lord gave him talents in all these matters. He will inquire about your aims and inform you about our way of life (for, as our confessor, he came to know all about it). In this way we won't be left in the dark on a matter so important. I don't think he'll refuse this act of charity.
12. You can speak with him about your concerns as with one who is completely familiar with my goals. Whatever he says in my place and agrees to, you can believe as though it were I speaking. May the Lord direct everything and make your honor his great servant, something I will beg of His Majesty from now on. The news that Father Guardian gave me about the works our Lord does through you obliges me to do this.
13. You are also especially obliged to pray for Father Guardian. He traveled a number of leagues for this matter only, and this he did on foot and discalced, which makes it more praiseworthy, as does the fact that he has devoted himself to my project as if it were his own. Indeed it is for the glory of our Lord and the honor of the glorious Virgin Mary.
Written in Avila in the monastery of St. Joseph, 28 June 1568.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence. I assure you that since I so enjoy your letters I look forward to receiving them. I don't know why it is that I have so special a love for your house and those who live there, unless it's because I suffered so many trials there. I am well now, glory to God. The fevers ended up in a bad cold.
2. I saw clearly the trial you would have to undergo because of the words and deeds of those Fathers. Even here there has been no lack of trial. But since God has delivered us from Tostado, I hope in His Majesty that we will be shown",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,2,15,0,3,23,0,0,1,8,8,7,6,13,2,3,2,2,3,2,0
"507",1576,34,"favor in everything else. I don't believe there is the slightest exaggeration in accusing him of hostility toward the discalced friars and me, for he gave clear signs of this. There is always need for much prayer that God will deliver our padre from these men and give them light and restore order in these matters. As long as our most reverend general is so displeased, I tell you there will be no lack of means for us to gain merit.
3. Because you will learn about everything from our padre, I'm not saying anything about this, except that I beg you out of charity to write to me, when our padre is unable, about what is going on, and give him my letters and send me a summary of his. You see what anxieties one goes through when present there. Imagine what I must go through being so far away. The chief mail carrier here is a cousin of one of our nuns in Segovia. He has come to see me and promises to do wonders for you. His name is Figueredo. He is, as I say, the chief mail carrier here. We have come to an agreement, and he says that if down there you take care to give the letters to the chief carrier, I will receive them in about eight days. What a great thing that would be! He says that by placing the packet for me in a folder addressed to Figueredo, the chief carrier in Toledo, no letter will be lost even if there are many. It's more work for you, but I know that you would take on even more for me, as I would for you.
4. You should know that at times I have such a desire to see you that it would seem I have nothing else to think about; this is true. You can find out down there whether you must use the title magnífico or something else. He has an important position. For this reason I am happier to stay here now, for Avila is an inconvenient place as far as these services go and for other things as well. I'm only sorry because of my brother who finds the separation difficult. You're wrong for not writing to him now and then. In the enclosed letter of his, you will see how bad his health is, although I praise God that he has no fever.
5. I never remember to keep the letters they write me about Teresa. All",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,5,0,7,12,1,1,1,13,5,12,8,9,4,4,0,0,2,0,0
"508",1576,35,"of the nuns tell of how they are in awe at the perfection they see in her and her inclination to assume the lowest offices. She tells them they shouldn't think that because she is the niece of the foundress they should esteem her more, but less. They are very fond of her; they say any number of things about her. I tell you this so that you give praise to God, for you were the nuns who directed her toward the desire for this good. I am delighted that you pray to His Majesty for her. I love her dearly and also her father, but I assure you I am at rest to be far away. I can't understand why, unless it is that the joys of this life are wearisome for me. I must be afraid of becoming attached to anything in it, and so it is better to remove the occasion; although so as not to be ungrateful for what my brother has done, I would like to be there now because he wants me present for the settling of certain matters.
6. Do not fail to let him know about the excise on the sale of the house, and me too; the information should conform to what is on the enclosed paper. I see clearly that you are not going to have enough money, and so I began dealing with the Nicolao matter so that they will give you at the appropriate time the 400 ducats. I had refused that postulant because they told me she had I don't know what kind of scar. Nicolao wrote me another letter, which I am enclosing. Our padre told me she isn't suited for us. Nonetheless, I have not been insistent, because in our present need one could consider if it may not be fitting to give her a try. Perhaps she will turn out to be good. Speak of the matter with our padre if you think you need to and find out about her faults, for I spoke to him only a little about this. I see that your income is poor. I was surprised to learn that Beatriz's mother brought no more than 1500 ducats, although she is such that even if she brought no dowry you would gain a great deal. I am happy that you are making stockings and earning a profit. God helps those who help themselves.
7. In answer to what you say about paying the rent by selling the other things,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,8,6,0,6,18,1,0,2,12,7,14,8,5,3,4,0,0,2,1,0
"509",1576,36,"it would clearly be a very great blessing to be free of that burden. If adding the dowry of Bernalda{Bernarda}, I mean of Pablos, the sum should reach 3,000 ducats, you should accept it. Speak about it first with some competent persons. When they added that condition, Padre Mariano told me it didn't matter, that even though it was added they would have to take the money because anything else would be unjust. Inquire about everything; before paying the rent, see that you have money in the house. Let Padre Garciálvarez speak with the different ones, and they should speak about it to our padre, for when he is there you needn't consult me about anything, but consult him. Please God Leonor's dowry will not be reduced. Tell me how she is doing -- for I am not at all satisfied with her intelligence -- and if she shows good will.
8. As for Vanegas, it would be a difficult thing to accept someone now who has nothing for a dowry. This could only be tolerated by doing it for the love of God alone, for no one has been accepted there under the title of an alms, and God will help us. Perhaps he will draw others to help us because of our doing this for him. This should be done only if the family pleads insistently with our padre and he gives you orders. You shouldn't say a word. And be careful, my friend, that you are not in a hurry to accept nuns, for your life depends on their being suited for us. This one of Nicolao's seems to be pretty and nothing else.
9. The niece or cousin of Garciálvarez, in my opinion, is certainly all that I told you she is. Caballar told me. I don't believe it is Doña Clemencia, but the other one. You can tell Garciálvarez frankly that they've told you she has suffered from great melancholy. He told me clearly she is insane, so I said no more. This was my impression, and I don't believe I am mistaken. The other girls have a father, and you will have a hard time getting something. Even were this not so, there would be no reason now to burden the house unless to free oneself at once from debt. Let's wait a little, for with the uproar caused by those friars down there, I am not surprised that no one is entering.
10. Keep track of all that you spend on postage so that",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,4,8,5,0,7,20,0,0,3,10,6,16,14,8,1,5,1,0,1,1,0
"510",1576,37,"you can subtract it from the forty ducats they have sent from St. Joseph's in Avila; and be careful not to do anything else, for that would not show zeal but foolishness. I have a reason for saying this. How can you presume to send money already! This struck me as funny, since I am so worried about what you are going to live on. Nevertheless, it arrived at an opportune time for paying the postage. May God reward you, and for the orange blossom water, which is very good, and for Juana de la Cruz's veil. However, you should not presume to do things like this again, for when I want something I will certainly let you know, and, I think, with greater openness and desire than I would with those in whom I have the greatest trust. For I believe that you and the nuns would willingly do whatever I ask. The one with the beautiful voice never came back. I am carefully watching for someone who would be suitable for your community.
11. Oh, how I hope they will give you the water! I have wanted this so much that I can't believe it. I have some hope that Padre Mariano, or our padre, will be able to work something out with Fray Buenaventura, since he is the Franciscans' guardian. May the Lord bring it about, for it would be a great relief. You can assuredly believe that it would mean more to me to be down there, now that our padre is on his way, than up here, even if I were to undergo some difficult moments because of the bishop. I am amazed by the joy I feel in the thought of returning to you. God does everything for the best. May he be blessed for everything and keep you for me many years.
12. So as not to sadden you I didn't want to speak to you about my own sorrow over the condition of our prioress in Malagón, although God has drawn profit from worse situations. Apart from how much I love her, her loss is a terrible thing for us at this time. I would have brought her here, but our doctor tells me that though she was given a year to live, she wouldn't live more than a month here. May the Lord find a remedy. Pray hard for her. Her condition is really hopeless. They say it's consumption. Be careful not to drink sarsaparilla water, even though it may be",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,3,10,0,9,23,1,0,4,12,7,16,15,5,3,4,2,0,1,1,4
"511",1576,38,"good against hysteria. The prioress and the sisters send their regards.
13. I have been very sorry about the illness of my holy prior, and we are praying for him. Let me know about him and of what has been done about Delgado, and if Beatriz and her sister were left something by their mother that should go to the house, and give my regards to all those you think it fitting, and remain with God. I have gone on at length and am happy to know that you are all well, especially you. I fear for our prioresses when I see the state we have come to. May God preserve you, my daughter.
14. At times I receive letters from Beas and Caravaca. They have no lack of trials in Caravaca, but I hope in God a remedy will be found.
Today is 7 September.
Your Reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
15. Let us now write more often. See that you don't neglect this or fail to be solicitous at times for our padre. He fully agrees with us about not serving meals to the friars. We have insisted on this so much that I wouldn't want him to go to extremes, and you can determine what his need is and consider how much his health matters to us.
16. How come you never say anything about Fray Gregorio? Give him my best wishes and tell me how the friars are doing -- if you don't write me about everything, no one will -- and how you are getting on with Fray Antonio de Jesús.
17. I will not answer Nicolao until I hear from you. You should pay half a real when you have no more than three or four letters; if you have more, then pay more.
18. Since I know what it's like to be in need and how hard it is to find money there, I did not dare reject entirely Nicolao's recommendation. When you ask our padre for his opinion on a matter, you need to inform him about everything without hurrying him; otherwise, because he's so busy, the importance of the matter will escape him. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. I can truthfully say that your letters are such a consolation. When I read the one and thought there were no more, I myself was surprised by the happiness I felt when I discovered another one; it was as though I hadn't received the first. You should then realize that your letters",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,3,9,0,5,12,1,0,3,14,7,14,11,8,2,3,2,0,2,0,1
"512",1576,39,"are a kind of recreation for me. Always send me a separate note listing the particular items you want me to respond to so that I don't forget anything.
2. With regard to the nuns, our padre left word, I think, that Beatriz's mother could enter, and I was delighted. So you are doing well to accept her, and you can give her the habit with my best wishes, for I am especially happy about this. And tell her that I would be happy to be there with her. I already wrote you to accept Beatriz for profession -- I will tell our padre. And give her my regards and tell her not to forget me on that day.
3. Regarding Garciálvarez's cousins, I don't know if you recall that I was told that one had been melancholic to the extreme, for she lost her mind. I don't believe it is Doña Constanza. Speak about the matter plainly. As for the niece, I know nothing. If suited for us, anyone from his family is preferable to others. Make a thorough inquiry and write for permission from our padre when you are fully informed. He will be in Almodóvar for now, as you will have learned, since the discalced friars are holding a chapter, an excellent thing for them to do. Why is it you didn't say anything about Padre Fray Gregorio's illness? I indeed felt sorry in hearing about it.
4. Getting back to the nuns, the aspirant with the beautiful voice of whom I wrote to you never returned. There is another one whom Nicolao highly recommends -- and Padre Mariano says that Nicolao will do so much for the house. This aspirant will bring a little over 400 ducats in addition to her trousseau. But she will give them right away. This is what I am trying to bring about, that you receive the interest and be free of worry. And there will even be enough to pay the excise on the sale's agreement. I am so sorry that the affair hadn't been concluded before that other one died; perhaps it's for the best.
5. Be always careful to prefer some agreement; and don't forget this, for our padre wrote me that a very learned man in Madrid told him we are not in the right and that even if we were, litigations are always troublesome. Don't forget this.
6. They have told me that this nun is very good. I have urged Juan Díaz to meet with her; if whatever",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,2,2,3,1,6,16,1,0,2,15,4,10,9,5,1,5,1,0,1,0,0
"513",1576,40,"the facial mark they say she has is unsightly she should not be accepted. I was attracted by the dowry money that, it is said, will be given as soon as we want it, for the money from Beatriz's mother and Pablo ought not to be touched; it should be reserved for making the principal payment. If you use it up for other expenses, you will be left with a heavy burden, which is a terrible thing. I would like if possible to send you help from here. I am going to inquire thoroughly about that young lady. They praise her highly, and indeed she is from up here. I will try to meet her.
7. As for what you say about the sermons, it is all right for now. In the present circumstances do what they tell you. In the future you must follow our Acts, however annoyed others become.
8. I repeat that I would not want you to sell this sister's goods, but we should look for other means. Otherwise, we will be left with that burdensome debt. It would be onerous to try to pay everything at once with Pablo's money. You would be left in a weakened situation.
9. Oh, how the letter from my daughters pleased us. I tell you it was excellent. Give them my regards and tell them I am obliged to write to Garciálvarez. I am delighted that he is in the present mood. Nonetheless, you should all be careful, for he is so perfect that what we might think is edifying will scandalize him. That region down there is not noted for its simplicity.
10. I am extremely delighted that the bishop is well and have given thanks to God. Tell him this when you see him, and if you don't see him very often, don't worry about it. Now the letters are well done, for each one tells me about something different. I was delighted with them.
11. Teresa is doing very well. The perfection she showed on the journey is something to praise God for; it was astonishing. She didn't want to sleep even one night outside the monastery. I assure you that just as you worked hard with her, she is now an honor to you. I can never finish thanking you for the good training you gave her, nor can her father. He is well. I tore up a letter that she had written me, which made us laugh. In your charity, please always pray for her; I ask",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,9,7,0,6,24,1,1,0,5,4,16,8,11,3,3,3,2,1,0,0
"514",1576,41,"this especially of her teacher. They write me that she is still homesick for Seville and praises you all highly. I think that some letters for the assistant will be included with these letters; if not, I'll send them later.
12. Today I wrote to Madrid to ask the Count of Olivares to write. It would be a very fortunate thing if he did. May God bring it about. I'll do what I can. Please God I'll be able to do something. I am greatly consoled to know that the house is cool; in exchange for this, I will be glad to put up with the heat here. Don't send me anything, for goodness' sake, for it costs more than it's worth. Some of the quinces arrived in good condition, but not many. The little fish were good. The tuna was left in Malagón and will do much good. Because they will write to you, I will not mention anything about their trials and the prioress's poor health; although the spitting up of blood has stopped, glory to God. May he watch over you, my daughters, and make you holy, amen.
13. I don't think one dares answer your letter. Nonetheless, I assure you that since you are wearing tunics of worsted wool, you can wear underskirts made of the same material without any imperfection. I much prefer this to fine wool.
Today is 9 September.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be ever with your honor. It seems to me our Lord is treating you as he does the strong, for since you want to be poor he is taking away your income. May he be blessed for everything, for he enriches those he loves by exercising them in suffering.
2. At the time I found out, I felt distressed. I was told of this by our Father Visitator who learned of it from the illustrious president of the Royal Council. Afterward I began to think it is for the best, for it is not possible that our Lord would neglect to care for you now that you are without a livelihood. May our Lord so direct events that you might serve him more. This is what all of us must desire who love you in the Lord, for it is what most suits you. I earnestly beseech God for this; the sisters here do likewise, and those up there will not fail to do the same. It is impossible for God to fail to do",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,9,1,2,6,17,0,6,20,1,0,5,10,5,9,16,6,1,0,2,3,2,2,0
"515",1576,42,"what most befits you. So, be very confident and joyful.
3. I have been happy since your servant told me that for a year you have been very well, without having any of your usual ailments. It wasn't Mother Prioress who told me. May God be praised and repay you for the help you are always giving the sisters, which seems inspired by God since you never tire of doing so. The Lord will satisfy this debt we owe you, for he is a very good paymaster.
4. I do not thank you more often for this since I know about you and you about me in another way. But be certain this doesn't mean any lack of gratitude; if I could serve you even to the point of it costing me my life and peace, I think I would do it ... May God grant you peace, as he can here below, so that you will enjoy the eternal rest.
5. The Bishop of Troya is not here, and so the chalice is not consecrated. They say he will come soon. I will arrange to send it to him when he comes. Have it repaired there in the meantime. I beg you not to forget to pray for me in your holy Masses. May His Majesty keep you many years, giving you the holiness I beg of him, amen.
Today is 13 September.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. Do not think, mi padre, that you can make things perfect with one stroke. What fruit can you bring about in the two or three days you stay in those small houses that Padre Fray Antonio could not? Hardly will you have left when they will return to their former ways, and you by doing this are exposing yourself to a thousand dangers.
2. Señora Doña Juana is convinced that you do what I ask of you. Please God that in the present matter this will be so. She spent three days here, although I was not able to enjoy her presence in the measure that I would have liked, for she had many other visitors, especially the canon. They became great friends. I assure you, the qualities God has given her are among the best. I have come across few instances in my lifetime of talent and character like hers, or I don't think any at all. She has a simplicity and openness that put me in seventh heaven. In",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,5,16,0,1,31,0,1,0,8,4,6,13,7,0,1,1,0,3,0,1
"516",1576,43,"these she greatly surpasses her son. It would be the greatest consolation to me if I lived in a place where I could converse with her frequently. We got along so well that one might have said we had known each other all our lives.
3. She says she was delighted with her stay here. God willed that she find lodging with a widow who lives alone with her maids. It was very much to her liking and close by, which she considered very fortunate. Her meals were prepared and brought to her from here; and it was providential that you gave me orders to keep money so as not to have to be dependent on what the monastery could provide, which would have been a painful thing for me. It was a small matter, but I was able to do things the way I like.
4. It amused me when you told me to open the grille and lift my veil for her. It seems you do not know me; I would have wanted to open the depths of my heart to her. Señora Doña Juana, her daughter, stayed with her until the last day. She seemed charming to me, and I am sorry to see her among those young girls at the school, because the truth of the matter is that, from what she says, she finds it more difficult there than she would here. I would willingly give her the habit along with that little angel of mine, her sister, who is as pretty and plump as can be. Señora Doña Juana couldn't get over her surprise on seeing her. Periquito, her brother, for all his intelligence, couldn't recognize her when he came. She is my whole recreation here. I spoke much about her to Señora Doña Juana. On the last day it seems she was somewhat touched, according to what Ana de Zurita told me. She told her that she had spent the night thinking about this and was close to making a decision, but that she wanted to reflect on it more. May God bring it about. Pray for this, for since she resembles you very much, I would love to have her with me.
5. Since Señora Doña Juana observed the happiness and behavior of all the nuns, she has decided to make the effort to send Señora Doña María to Valladolid soon, and I think she has repented for having dissuaded Señora Doña Adriana from going there. She was very satisfied, from what I",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,2,7,0,4,13,0,0,1,14,5,13,8,4,2,4,1,1,1,1,1
"517",1576,44,"could tell, and I don't think she is deceitful.
6. Yesterday she wrote me a highly complimentary letter, saying that while she was here she did not experience her pain and sadness. Her letter got torn up along with some others. I can't count the letters that have arrived these past two days. They'll make me lose my mind. I felt bad that the letter was destroyed, for I wanted to send it to you. The day she left she said that the tertian fever had left Señor Lucas Gracián and that he is now well. Oh, what a nice person Tomás Gracián is. I like him very much. He also came here. Today I wrote to him telling him that you were doing well.
7. I was thinking today about which of us two loved you more. I find that Señora Doña Juana has a husband and other children to love, and poor Laurencia has nothing else on earth but this padre. May God be pleased to watch over him for her, amen, for I am consoling her as much as I can. She tells me that Joseph has assured her again, and in this way she keeps going, although with trials and without any relief from them.
8. Let's come now to the chapter. The members have returned extremely happy, and I am very happy about all the good that was accomplished, glory to God! As usual, this time, too, you have not been spared great praise. It all comes from his hand; and also, perhaps, the prayers do much good, as you say. I was extremely pleased about the appointment of a zelator for the various houses. That is a very good step and will prove beneficial. I insisted with him that he stress manual labor, for it is infinitely important. I said I would write to you about it because the chapter did not deal with this. I told him that it was in the constitutions and the rule and that he could do nothing better than to see to their observance. I was also happy -- so much so that I couldn't believe it -- that they expelled the ones they did from the order. To be able to do this is very important.
9. I was also very happy over the steps taken to strive in every way possible to become a separate province by approaching our Father General, for it is an unbearable battle to have to go about with the displeasure of one's major",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,1,5,0,7,27,1,2,2,7,2,5,6,7,2,4,2,1,2,2,0
"518",1576,45,"superior. If this costs money, God will provide it; let it be given to the two companions. And for love of God, your paternity should make every effort that they not delay in going. Don't take this as a secondary matter, for it is the most important. And if that prior of La Peñuela knows Father General well, it would be a good idea for him to accompany Padre Mariano. And if they cannot obtain any concessions, let them speak with the pope. But the first course of action is the best, and now is the propitious time. And in view of Methuselah's health, I don't know why we are waiting, which is like having nothing to stand on and then one day discovering that we are lost.
10. You should know that a priest friend of mine -- who discusses matters of his soul with me -- told me today that he is very certain that Gilberto will die soon, and he even mentioned that it could be this year. He said that he had experienced such presentiments about others and that these were never wrong. This is something possible, although one shouldn't pay attention to such experiences. But since it is not impossible, it would be good for you to keep in mind, for the sake of our concerns, that this could happen. So deal with the visitation matters as with things of short duration. All that Fray Pedro Fernández wanted to have carried out at the Incarnation, he did through the hand of Fray Angel -- and he observed from afar. Not for this reason did he cease to be the visitator or fail to do his duty. I always remember how that provincial treated you when you were staying in their house, and so I wouldn't want you to show any ingratitude, if you can avoid it. They complain that you are being directed by Padre Evangelista. Also in this regard, you should be careful, for we are not so perfect as to be unable to feel dislike for some and affection for others.
11. The prioress of Malagón is somewhat better, glory to God, although that means little, according to what the doctors say. I was amazed that you wanted to leave the decision to me about going to Malagón when it is out of the question for many reasons. One of them is that there would be no sense to it, for I do not have enough health to care for the sick, nor",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,3,8,1,6,17,1,0,2,14,6,18,13,6,1,3,2,1,4,1,0
"519",1576,46,"that much charity. As for the house, I mean the work on it, I am accomplishing much more here. Since Antonio Ruiz is there, the nuns have nothing to worry about. And even if my presence were greatly needed, this would not be a good time to go as you can see.
12. Another good thing is that you are not giving me orders to go, nor do you think that it would be good for me if I did, and that you are telling me I can do what seems to me best. That would show great perfection on my part, to think that my opinion would be better than yours! When they told me that the prioress had lost her senses and speech -- insisting on the seriousness of the situation -- I sent word that the direction of the house should be taken up by Juana Bautista, who in my opinion was the best choice. It's so much trouble for me to have to transfer nuns such a distance that I avoid doing so as long as I can. I wrote to the prioress so that she would know my opinion, if she were in any condition to read it, but said that if she thought otherwise she could choose whomever she wanted, for that would be in accord with the order's rule.
13. She did not want Juana Bautista and chose Beatriz de Jesús, who she said is much better. Perhaps she may be, but I don't think so. Nor did she want Isabel de Jesús to be novice mistress. They have so many novices that I am worried. Isabel has experience and has not formed bad novices; she may not be astute, but she is a good nun. The licentiate didn't think Isabel should be chosen either, but Beatriz now has ended up with everything and she is exhausted. If she can't manage, there are others to choose from, and for this house that would be better, in my opinion, than bringing in a nun from elsewhere while God still preserves the life of the prioress. I have clearly seen that you did everything so as to please her. But if I should be tempted to go, it would be difficult. Hardly do I think of going somewhere, it seems to me, than everybody knows about it. As for me, I can tell you that in a way I would be happy to spend some days there.
14. Doña Luisa was here yesterday, and I think",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,3,2,5,0,9,15,3,0,1,16,1,23,19,5,2,3,0,0,2,0,0
"520",1576,47,"I got her to agree to give 4,000 ducats this year, for she only had to give 2,000. The construction manager says that if she gives this amount, he will build the place for the nuns by a year from this Christmas; that is, they will be able to live there by then. So it seems that God guides you well, for my stay here will be most beneficial, and will even bring me happiness. I experience much happiness when I don't have to see relatives as prioress in Avila.
15. My temperament is strange, for when I saw that in leaving me here you weren't concerned that I had no desire to stay, I felt the greatest happiness. And I felt free about expressing my desires and opinions when I saw that you pay no attention to what I think.
16. I told Isabel's novice mistress to write to you. In case you don't remember her name, the enclosed letter is for you. Oh, how pretty she is becoming. How plump she's getting and charming. May God make her a saint and watch over your paternity much more than me. Pardon me for making this so long and be patient since you are down there and I am up here. I am well. Today is the vigil of the feast of St. Matthew. Regarding that matter about Rome, I beg you to hurry; don't wait until summer, for the weather is good now, and believe me that this is what is fitting for us.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
17. Don't kill yourself over those nuns, for according to what Methuselah says, your office will be of short duration. And the night owls think this also, for they say he told Peralta to hurry so as to be back here within two months, and they say that certainly he will take full charge. Oh, if only this matter were concluded! How welcome that would be, and may His Majesty deliver us from all this confusion. For Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's, Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. I wrote at length to our padre and so I have nothing more to say except that I desire news about you and that the prioress of Malagón is a bit better.
2. My brother wants to know if you received his letters, one of which contained four reales to be given to the pharmacist who lives near your house. They are for some",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,2,10,1,3,15,1,1,0,11,7,8,10,2,4,5,2,0,1,0,0
"521",1576,48,"ointment my brother received from him when, I think, he had the sore leg. If they didn't arrive, pay for this yourself and don't neglect to write to him, for I think he expects this even though I send him your greetings. My best regards to all the nuns; the prioress sends her regards to you. She will write through the muleteer. I didn't permit her to do so now hoping to pay less postage. More letters have arrived than I expected, and so the cost for postage will be high.
3. I would like to have news about mi padre, about the prior of Las Cuevas, and about what has been done in regard to the water. May God in his power provide and watch over all the sisters for me; give them my regards. For goodness' sake remember to tell our padre to be careful, and to show him every attention; and add what you spend to the forty ducats and don't be foolish. Do what I'm telling you, and also pay the postage, for I will verify it here. I am asking all the nuns to pray hard for you, although I see there is no need to do so.
Today is the vigil of St. Matthew, and I am yours,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's Carmel of Seville, Discalced Carmelite Nuns, San José Street, Behind San Francisco.
1. Jesus be with your reverence. I wrote you two days ago by way of the chief courier, and so I have nothing to say here except that my brother is now well (for I forgot to mention this) and that the nuns don't want such expensive fine wool. The material they use for the underskirts here is like what you used for Teresa, although coarser, the coarser the better. For goodness' sake, take care to send me news of our padre by the means I pointed out in the letter his paternity brought you. I'm longing to know whether he arrived safely and how his trip went. If I was so concerned when he was close, imagine what I feel now!
2. My great desire is that you be careful not to fill the house with nuns unless someone comes along who is suited for the life and able to help pay for the house. I also desire that you reach an agreement about the excise. I assure you that your troubles are of concern to me. Please God, I may see you without any and with",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,2,7,10,0,4,17,0,0,2,8,4,10,7,5,3,1,2,1,2,0,1
"522",1576,49,"the health I desire for you. My regards to all the sisters, and to my nurse, whom I don't forget, especially at night.
3. I am not going to write again to our padre now, for as I say I wrote him at length the day before yesterday, and I think he will be so busy that it will be good not to bother him with unnecessary matters. I pray hard for him. Don't fail to do so there. And give my very best regards to Padre Fray Gregorio. You haven't mentioned whether his health is all right now.
Yesterday was the feast of St. Matthew.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
We are well. 1. Jesus be with your reverence. The carrier for this letter is in such a hurry that I can't say any more than that I am well and that Padre Mariano arrived late yesterday. I enjoyed your letter. Glory to God that you are all well.
2. Don't accept the daughter of the Portuguese -- or whatever he is -- if he doesn't first deposit with a third person what he must give you. I have learned that you won't be able to get a cent of it, and this is no time for us to accept a postulant for nothing; be careful not to do otherwise.
3. Give the enclosed letters to our Father Provincial personally. And tell him not to be disturbed. Up here Padre Mariano and I are looking into what is going on down there to see if we can find a solution and we will do everything we possibly can. Tell him as well that after these letters were written I was going to entrust them to the good Antonio Ruiz, who was going to Madrid, when Padre Mariano arrived. I was delighted to see him and to know that the Lord is now so arranging our affairs that those Fathers are going to leave before being thrown out.
4. Write to me, for goodness' sake, at once and in detail about what is going on. Don't leave this to our padre, for he won't have time. Many greetings to Señor Garciálvarez and tell him that I long to see him. Look at my desires, so seemingly impossible to realize. May God reward him for all the favors he does us and watch over him; and also our good prior, for whom we have prayed hard. I'm happy that he's somewhat better. Tell me also about your health, and tell our padre how much I would have",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,7,0,3,19,1,1,1,9,2,7,9,6,6,2,2,0,4,0,0
"523",1576,50,"wanted Padre Mariano to wait for him.
5. Regards to my daughters, and remain with God, my friend. The nuns in Caravaca have been sick; I am told they have written to you. They are doing well now and already buying a house. Since I have not answered their letter, I'm not sending it on to you. I was delighted with the news from Beas and the accounts of Padre Fray Gregorio; I will write to him.
Mother Prioress in Malagón is very sick.
I think today is 26 September.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus 1. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. If the letter you sent by way of Madrid had not arrived, I would have been in a fine state, for today is the day after the feast of St. Francis and Fray Antonio has not come; nor did I know whether you had arrived in good health until I saw your letter.
2. May God be blessed that you are well and that Paul is too and interiorly at rest. Surely so complete an improvement seems supernatural. All of that must be necessary for this nature of ours, for such things serve well to humiliate and give us self-knowledge. I prayed earnestly here that the Lord would give him a period of calm, for it seems to me he has enough other trials. Tell him this for me.
3. Right now I am without any trials. I don't know where this will end up. They have given me a cell set apart like a hermitage and very cheerful, and my health is good, and I am away from relatives, although they reach me through their letters. Only my worries about what is going on down there trouble me. I tell you that as far as what pleases me goes you had a good idea in choosing to let me stay here. And even regarding the worries I mentioned, I feel more confident than usual.
4. Last night I was reading the story of Moses and about the troubles he brought on the king and his whole kingdom with those plagues and how they never touched him. In fact, I was amazed and happy to see that no one has the power to cause harm if the Lord does not wish it. I enjoyed the account of the crossing of the Red Sea, thinking of how much less it is that we are asking for. It pleased me to see that saint in the midst of those conflicts",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,11,1,6,22,3,1,0,10,4,7,6,8,4,0,2,0,4,0,0
"524",1576,51,"by order of God. I was feeling joy at seeing my Eliseo in the same situation and I offered him again to God. I remembered the favors Joseph has granted me and what he has said about him: ""Still much more has to be endured for the honor and glory of God"". I was consumed with the desire to find myself amid a thousand perils in order to serve him. With these and similar thoughts my life is passing. I've also written the foolish things you will find enclosed.
5. Now I am going to begin writing the story of the Foundations which Joseph told me will be for the benefit of many souls. If God helps, I believe this will be so. But even apart from this locution, I had already decided to write the account since you had ordered me to do it. I was delighted that you gave such a long report at the chapter. I don't know how those who have written contrary to what you reported are not ashamed. It is fortunate that those who perhaps would have had to leave against their will are leaving of their own accord. It seems to me our Lord is straightening out our affairs. May it please His Majesty that what we are doing will bring him glory and be of benefit to those souls. You will be doing well if you give orders from your own monastery about what should be done. Then they won't have to be observing whether you go to choir or not; I tell you everything will go better. Here, our prayers are not lacking; they are better weapons than the ones used by those Fathers.
6. I wrote to you at length through the chief courier, and while waiting to know if you have received those letters, I have been writing by way of Madrid. About the matter concerning David, I think he will hoodwink Padre Esperanza, as he usually does, for they are together and his brother has left. Although the presence of Fray Buenaventura can accomplish much, I fear that it will do no more than create obstacles, for the two know about the matter. This is fortunate because, God forgive me, I wish David would return to his first calling. I have learned nothing more since I've been here.
Your paternity's daughter and servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's in Seville.
1. Jesus be with your reverence. I don't know how it is you let the muleteer leave",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,12,0,4,15,2,1,0,15,8,9,8,1,1,2,1,0,1,0,0
"525",1576,52,"without sending a letter, especially since our padre is down there and we would like to get news about him every day. I greatly envy all of you that you have him with you there. For goodness' sake, don't do this any more; and don't fail to write to me about everything that is happening. Our padre's letters are short, and when he doesn't have time to write, you should be sure to do so. I've already written to you about the means you can use to send me frequent letters.
2. I was delighted to learn, through the letter that Padre Mariano brought -- Fray Antonio has not come -- that you and all the nuns are well and that an agreement has been reached concerning the excise.
3. My brother is now well. He is always happy to receive news about you. I've already told you not to fail to write to him now and again. He bought some property -- which he was already considering when he was down there -- near Avila, I think a league and a half away, or not quite that. It has pasture lands, grain fields, and woods. It cost him 14,000 ducats, but the papers have not yet been drawn up. He says that what has happened down there has taught him a lesson not to close the purchase unless everything is very safe and clear, for he doesn't want any problems. Pray for him and his sons (who already have opportunities for marriage) that they will serve God.
4. You should know that as soon as I arrived here, thinking that we would leave immediately, the trunk and all the packages were sent ahead with a muleteer. And I don't know if it was in unpacking or how, but Teresa's large agnusdei and the two emerald rings are missing, nor do I remember where I put them or if they were given to me. Really, I felt sad to see how everything happened so as to contradict the joy she had in the thought that I would be there with her; she needs me in many ways. Try to remember if these objects were in the house when we left, and ask Gabriela if she remembers where I might have put them, and pray that they may be found.
5. I was very surprised by what you told me about the Fathers in the Society. As that other person told you, they are almost as rigorous as we are. It would be",2,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,3,4,0,7,12,0,2,4,14,4,13,14,10,1,2,1,0,0,0,0
"526",1576,53,"good if Padre Garciálvarez were to speak to them. My regards to him and to all my daughters and to Father Prior of Las Cuevas. We are praying hard for his return to health. May it please God to give it to him, for his illness distresses me and I am not going to write to him until I know that he is better. Keep me informed of his condition as often as you have a messenger.
6. It would be good, despite all this, if you were to arrange at times to have someone from the Society hear the nuns' confessions. This would help toward removing the fear they have in our regard. Padre Acosta would be very good, if you could get him. May God forgive them, for if she is so rich, her entry would bring an end to their problems; yet, since His Majesty didn't bring her to us, he will provide. Perhaps there was a greater need for her in the community she entered.
7. I thought that since Fray Buenaventura was there the negotiations about the water would improve, but it doesn't seem there is any easing off. May God permit us to pay for the house; then, having money, you will be able to obtain everything. Let things go for now, since you have good wells. We would pay highly here for one of them, for this matter of getting water is a real problem.
8. Tell me how the visitation of Fray Buenaventura is going, and what is being done about the monastery they abolished near Córdoba, for I know nothing. I am feeling well and am at your service, as they say. Tell me also whether our padre comes to your monastery to eat sometimes and how you cater to him, for he cannot be catered to in his own monastery, nor would it appear right. Send me news about everything, and remain with God, for now we will be able to write often, as is fitting.
9. I was amused by the account of the old woman you have there and how she used the stairs. Tell me if the boy is still there and if you have anyone to do your errands. Mother Prioress in Malagón wrote to me that she is doing better; but that illness is such that a little improvement is not enough to make me happy. Keep her always in your prayers.

"527",1576,54,"your daughters as well. Amen.
10. In the enclosed letter from Sister Alberta you will see how things are going in Caravaca. I was delighted with the letter from Beas (for I hadn't received any news from them in some time) and that that nun who is very rich entered there. Everything is working out well, glory to God. Always pray hard for our padre, and for me too, for I am in need.
Yesterday was the feast of St. Francis.
11. Enclosed is the postage, for it's expensive, and be careful to let me know if you do not have the money to take good care of our padre when the occasion arises; and don't be proud, for that's foolish. I can send it to you. And take care of your health, if for no other reason than not to kill me, for I tell you the sickness of the prioress in Malagón is costing me dearly. May God provide by restoring her health, amen.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
12. When letters are entrusted to the muleteer, you can enclose the postage. When they are not, you know what usually happens if you enclose it; the letters are at risk of never arriving. I tell you this so that you will never do it. 1. All these sisters kiss your lordship's hands many times.
For a year now we have been hoping that you would come to visit my Señora Doña María. Señor Don Bernardino assured us of this, and we were very happy about it. Our Lord did not will it. May it please His Majesty that I will see you in that place where there will be no separation. The psalms were recited this year on the same day, and this we will always do gladly. May our Lord always guide you and for his greater service preserve you for many years.
2. Señor Fray García is doing very well, glory to God. He is always gracious to us, and each day he is more dedicated to your service. He has undertaken an office given him by his provincial, that of novice master -- a lowly task for someone of his authority. But it was not given him for any other reason than that his spirit and virtue benefit the order and imbue those souls with that spirit. He accepted the office with so much humility that he was most edifying. He has much work to do. Today is 6 July.

Teresa of Jesus
Would you do me the favor",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,4,17,1,4,24,1,1,1,5,3,7,15,9,2,0,2,1,3,1,0
"528",1576,55,"of sending this padre quickly. It could be that a letter from you would be helpful. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, mi padre. Your house is so far out of the way that even though I want to, I have no one through whom I can answer you, and so I have waited until the departure of these fathers.
2. Concerning Padre Fray Antonio, perhaps God did us a favor because, as I understand, he suffered from serious melancholy, which, considering our diet, would have become much worse. May God be with him, for what he suffers certainly seems to come more from lack of health than from lack of a good spirit. You can't avoid its becoming known, for they will have to provide for a preacher in Almodóvar. Please God he will return to his order. Neither by his having come nor by his leaving does our own order lose anything.
3. I thought you would pass by on your return, but only a slight detour was enough to prevent you from coming. Your desire to please me must not be very great, for even when you were here before, I got to speak with you only a little. You should know that in a similar measure I have very little influence in doing anything about what you wrote concerning the departure for Rome. For some time now I have been asking that someone go to Rome and haven't even succeeded in getting anyone to write a letter to the one who ought to receive a letter. But it is enough that we do what we can, come what may. And the matter doesn't depend on our Father Visitator, for he has already done what he could; but so many people are making different recommendations that mine count for little. I deeply regret not being able to do more. I thought this trip had been decided on; that is what I was told. May God provide, and for goodness' sake don't neglect to hurry things along; you can do more than I can.
4. Although I sent the letters to Seville and Almodóvar at once, I think Father Prior had already arrived in Madrid and is still there. I also sent the one to Caravaca, which was a lucky thing, for a carrier was about to leave for that region, and there aren't many who go there. I am very sorry about Fray Gabriel's illness. Tell him this and give him my",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,9,0,10,11,1,0,6,12,4,13,12,2,0,1,0,0,2,0,1
"529",1576,56,"regards, for we are praying for him here. He is a Father for whom I have a great affection, although he has little for me.
5. Our padre has written me that he arrived in good health and that some of the Fathers of the cloth have left and that the conventual chapter was satisfied with him. There is nothing else except that those Fathers are being docile and sending intercessors to him. If God watches over him for us, I think he will do much good. Don't neglect to take care to pray for him, and for me too. I entrust myself to the prayers of all the Fathers there; the prioress asks for yours. May our Lord make you as holy as I beg of him, amen.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's in Seville, my daughter.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. I have been feeling very distressed over your illness. I don't know what to do to keep from feeling it so deeply when a prioress in one of our houses becomes sick. The prioress in Malagón is getting better, glory to God. Take care of yourself, and whatever you do, avoid the sarsaparilla water. And for the love of God, don't let the fever go without taking some remedy for it, something other than purgatives. I have found some comfort in remembering that sometimes they thought you had the fever but I could see that you did not. May God preserve you for me and give you the good health I ask of him, amen.
2. The packages arrived in good condition and that will always be so with Figueredo's services. The cost of the postage will be safe; you can write on the outside the amount that is enclosed -- and don't forget to enclose it. You must tell me how my letters reach you, for I doubt if the ones I sent with Figueredo have arrived there yet. Here they are not in any danger, for he has been alerted to the situation and is a very good man. And although you have responded to some of my letters, I don't remember with whom I sent them. May God watch over you, for you are doing things very well. But it isn't necessary for you to enclose my letters with your responses; I think that would prove tiresome.
3. Oh, how I envy your hearing those sermons, and how I long to",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,16,0,6,17,3,2,1,11,5,5,13,5,3,1,2,0,7,1,1
"530",1576,57,"be with all of you. Here they say that I love the nuns in the Seville house more than all the others. Certainly, I don't know why, but I do love them dearly. So, I am not surprised by your affection for me, for I have always felt the same way toward you, but it pleases me to hear this. There is no longer any reason to speak of what happened in the past, for I certainly don't believe you were responsible for it. I like your courage, and so I believe God will help you. May he be pleased to grant you health as I beseech him.
4. I was delighted to hear of the clothing and the profession; give them my congratulations, and tell San Francisco her letters are a joy to me, as are those of the other nuns, and ask their pardon for my not answering. The amount of correspondence I had down there was nothing; since I've come up here, it has gotten to be terrible.
5. In regard to Garciálvarez's relatives do what you think best, for he will speak the truth, and anyone from his family could not be bad. If I have time I will write to ask him not to stop hearing the nuns' confessions, for that is something I regret; if I don't write, tell him for me. I am very sorry about the illness of our good Father Prior. We are praying for him. I am afraid the courier is ready to leave, so I am not writing him. You will lose a lot if you lose him, but God, who lives forever, will be with you.
6. Regarding the prayer of those sisters, I am writing to our padre; he will speak to you about it. When San Jerónimo experiences something, write to me. By no means speak to Rodrigo about it; with Acosta, you can. Give him my best regards, for I get along very well with him, and we owe him much.
7. I was delighted about the settlement over the excise. My brother has purchased an exempt estate at La Serna, near Avila. It is a very nice piece of property, with pasture lands, grain fields, and woods. It cost 14,000 ducats. Since he didn't have that amount then -- far from it -- this would be the time for you to reimburse a third of what you owe him, and not fail to do so on account of your need of money for food. I hope",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,7,8,0,8,22,1,0,4,9,4,8,10,7,0,8,1,0,2,2,1
"531",1576,58,"in God that you will be able to manage without it. If little by little you can collect what the people in the house owe you, that will be great.
8. You don't mention the deputy's daughter; my regards to her and all her sisters, and anyone else you see, and to Delgado and Blas, and remain with God. Send my regards to Fray Gregorio and tell him to keep me always informed about his health. And may God give you back your health, for I liked your work. Nonetheless, you shouldn't try to spin when you have a fever; otherwise it will never leave you, considering how much you move your arm when you spin and how much you spin. Regards to Margarita.
9. If you must have a lay sister, keep in mind that a relative of our padre's is agitating to enter; let me know if you can take her. The prioress in Valladolid  has seen her. She says she would be a good lay sister. She probably does not know how to read. Our padre doesn't want to become involved in the matter. His little sister is someone special and of a gentler disposition than Teresa; she has unusual ability. I am delighted with her.
Today is 13 October.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus For mi padre, Doctor Fray Mariano de San Benito, Carmelite, Madrid.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence and reward you for the good news you have given me about the health of our good padre, Señor Licentiate Padilla. Please God it will continue for many years. So now you are calling me reverend and señora! God forgive you, for this makes it seem that you and I have turned into calced Carmelites. I was amused by the friendship of the reverend padre who came to ask you for a favor. He tried it with me in Avila -- and God grant him better health! -- although there are twelve hours in a day. Perhaps he has changed.
2. You should know that I've been told -- and it is so -- that Tostado has sent a messenger here with letters for the provincial, who wants to send a friar there. It seems to me there is a lot of coming and going. I am sorry about the departure of Fray Buenaventura, not to mention the good he was accomplishing. If the foolish things being done against him succeed, everyone will deduce that God is favoring him. And you do not tell",1,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,1,1,11,0,3,18,0,1,0,10,6,10,14,4,2,1,0,1,6,0,0
"532",1576,59,"me what is being done about that suppressed monastery. O Jesus, how many things you allow!
3. I wish we already had that little house; the rest can be done afterward, God willing. I wouldn't even want to see the walls of the house of those who have so little love for us. I have already said that a letter from the Señor Nuncio would set everything straight. Mi padre, let us hurry to do all that we can. And if you are able, take up the matter of a separate province, for we don't know what lies in store for us. And nothing would be lost by so doing, but much would be gained. For goodness' sake, if you receive any news about our padre, write to me about it, for I am worried. My greetings to Señor Licentiate Padilla and to Padre Fray Baltasar. The prioress sends hers to them as well, and to you. I was happy to see that that revered padre is there. May God be with you always.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. Yesterday I wrote to you of how those fathers had so calmed down that I praised God for it. You should know that the mandate and the Motu had still not been read to them. I feared very much what has now come about, and today one of them came and told me they have reacted strangely. Since they think they are right, they will surely cause a stir. They say what I have often told Padre Mariano (and I am pretty sure I even wrote this to you) that to give commands as a superior without showing where the authority comes from is something that is never done.
2. In regard to what you said in your letter about Padre Mariano, about why you did not send the brief, certainly if there were reason for doubt, it would have been better to think of this beforehand. If only they would free you from that task and leave you free for us discalced friars and nuns.
3. Padre Padilla will tell you how Melchizedek says that according to the council I cannot make foundations and that our Most Reverend Father has expressly declared this. I would like it very much if you could look over this declaration, if possible. As for what he says about my bringing nuns around with me, I do so always with permission from superiors. I",2,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,3,12,0,5,17,3,1,1,5,11,17,16,8,3,5,0,0,0,1,0
"533",1576,60,"have here the very permission Melchizedeck himself gave me to bring nuns to Beas and Caravaca. How is it that he didn't take this into consideration at that time since the declaration had already existed then? If only they'd leave me in peace.
4. May God give you, mi padre, the rest I desire for you. Perhaps these Fathers will now disgorge all the venom and be better afterward, although in my opinion they were very disposed to obey. This clash has not bothered me. Rather, I enjoy all this opposition, for it is a sign that God will be well served.
5. The enclosed letter for you has to do with the project in Salamanca, for I think they have written to you about it. I wrote to them that the work was not suited to discalced friars. If a place is provided for them there, all right; but not that they be vicars (for I don't think anything else is wanted). Two months is a very short time for such a work. The bishop is not asking this of them. Neither does he show any desire that they be sent to that place, nor are they meant for such works. I would like it if the discalced friars were to be looked upon there as beings from another world and not as friars coming and going in the service of women. We have won over the bishop to our cause without this. But we could perhaps lose him if we accepted such a work. I don't know if good Don Teutonio will do anything, for his chances are limited and he is not a good negotiator. If I were there to stir things up, I truly believe we'd succeed. And perhaps this could be so, if you thought it fitting. I wrote to them about all of this.
6. The prioress and other nuns ask for your prayers and those of the Fathers there with you; I ask for those of Fray Gregorio. My Isabel is well and very enjoyable, and Señora Doña Juana and her family are also well. Give my regards now and then, for charity's sake, to the lord prosecutor and to the archbishop, and also to Señora Delgada and to your other women friends, especially Bernarda. Let this request be a standing one. Remain with God, for it is very late.
Today is the feast of St. Hilarion, my Father.
Your paternity's servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,8,2,1,1,13,0,2,17,0,1,1,7,4,14,15,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"534",1576,61,"your reverence. It's quite clear that you have not understood all that I owe to Padre Olea and how much I care for him, for you have written me about matters that he has discussed, or is discussing, with me. I believe you now know that I am not an ungrateful person. So, I tell you that if in this matter I should have to give up my rest and health, it would already be done. But where a matter of conscience is involved, friendship doesn't suffice, for I owe more to God than to anyone. Would to God the matter involved no more than a lack of dowry, for you already know -- and if you don't you should inquire for yourself -- that there are many nuns in these monasteries who have brought no dowry, while the dowry of this person is a good one. They are giving 500 ducats, which is enough for her to become a nun in any monastery.
2. Since Padre Olea doesn't know the nuns in these houses, I am not surprised by his disbelief. I know what servants of God they are and the innocence of their souls. I could never believe they would refuse the habit to anyone without many reasons. I know how scrupulous they usually are about these things, and for them to make a decision like that, they would have had to have good reasons. And since we are few nuns, the disturbance caused by those who are not suited for religious life is so great that even someone with an unscrupulous conscience would have a problem about accepting them; how much more would someone who seeks not to displease the Lord in anything.
3. Would you tell me how I could get them by force to take a nun if they do not vote in her favor -- and they are not doing so -- and if no prelate is even capable of doing this? And don't think this matters to Padre Olea. He has written to me that he has no greater interest in her than in anyone else he may pass on the street. It's because of my sins that you have been inspired by charity toward something in which I cannot be of help, and I feel badly about it. Even if I were to help, it wouldn't benefit her to stay where she is not wanted.
4. I have done even more in this case than was reasonable. And I asked them to keep",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,14,0,4,15,1,0,0,18,13,20,17,3,0,0,1,0,2,0,0
"535",1576,62,"her for another year of trial, contrary to their will, so that if I pass by there when I go to Salamanca I can become better informed about the whole matter. I'm doing this as a favor to Padre Olea that he may feel more satisfied. I see clearly that the nuns are not lying, for you know how even in matters of little importance such a thing would be far from their minds. It is nothing new for nuns to leave our communities; it is common. And nothing is lost if they say they didn't have the health for so austere a life, nor have I seen anyone less esteemed on this account.
5. Having learned my lesson by this, I will have to be more careful about what I do from here on. So, the person proposed by Señor Nicolao will not be accepted, even if you are more satisfied with her. I have other information, and I don't want to make enemies in order to do a favor for my lords and friends. It is strange that you would wonder why there is a discussion about this. Were we to behave otherwise, no nun would ever be accepted. I wanted to do him a favor, but I had received new information different from what I had first received, and I know Señor Nicolao desires what is good for these houses over anyone's particular good. So he was at peace with this.
6. For love of God don't speak any more about this. She has a good dowry and can enter some other community -- not one in which the numbers are so small that the nuns have to be extremely careful about whom they choose. And if up until now we were not so cautious in some cases -- although these are rare -- things turned out so badly that from now on we will be. And do not put us at odds with Señor Nicolao, which would happen if we had to send her away again.
7. I was amused by your saying that just by seeing her you will be able to recognize the kind of person she is. We women are not so easy to get to know. After many years of hearing confessions, confessors themselves are amazed at how little they have understood. And it is because women cannot express their faults clearly, and the confessors judge by what they are told. Padre, when you desire that one of these houses do you the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,2,1,9,0,6,20,0,2,1,19,5,13,15,4,3,4,1,0,3,1,0
"536",1576,63,"favor of accepting somebody, send us those who are gifted for this life, and you will see that we will not make an issue over the dowry. When such talent is lacking, I can by no means be obliging.
8. You should know that I thought it would be easy to have a house in Madrid where the friars could stay. And even though the house were not a monastery, it wouldn't be unusual for them to have permission for Mass; it is given to caballeros for Mass in their homes. So, I informed our padre about this. He told me that it wouldn't be opportune since this could do harm to our cause, and I think he was right. And knowing his will in this matter, you shouldn't have decided to bring so many friars together and set up a church as though you had permission, which has made me laugh. I never even bought a house until I had permission from the ordinary of the place. You know well what it cost me in Seville for not having gotten this permission.
9. I told you often that until you have a letter from the nuncio granting permission, nothing should be done. When Don Jerónimo told me that you asked the friars of the observance, I was dumbfounded. So as not to resemble all of you by trusting them so much, at least for the moment, I have no intention of speaking to Valdemoro. I have a suspicion that any friendship he shows us is not intended for our good but only to catch us in something that he can report to his friends. And I wish you were as suspicious and would not trust him or make use of such friends for this affair. Leave the matter to the One to whom it belongs, that is to God, for His Majesty will take care of it in his time. Don't be in such a hurry, for that will ruin everything.
10. You should know that Don Diego Mejía is a very good gentleman and that he will do what he says. Since he has decided to speak about the matter, he must have come to know that his cousin will act in our favor. You should realize as well that if his cousin does not do it for him he will not do it for his aunt either. There's no reason to write to her or to anyone else. They are first cousins, and a relative and friend of",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,4,2,3,0,5,18,2,1,1,16,10,15,8,4,1,3,0,0,1,0,0
"537",1576,64,"Don Diego Mejía is to be highly esteemed. And it is also a good sign that the archdeacon has said he will present a report about us, for if he hadn't thought of doing it in our favor, he wouldn't have taken on this task. The matter is moving along well. You should not be stirring things up; you may make matters worse. Let's see what Don Diego and the archdeacon do. I will try to find out if there is anyone here who may be able to intervene. And if the dean can do anything, Doña Luisa will be able to get him to do so.
11. All of this has pleased me greatly and made me believe that God will make good use of this foundation; nothing came about through what we ourselves did. It's very nice that you have the house, for sooner or later we will have the permission. If the nuncio had given it to us, everything would now be over. May it please our Lord to give him the health that he sees is necessary in our regard. I tell you that by no means does Tostado lack confidence, nor am I sure that the One who began all this will give up working through him.
12. Regarding Salamanca, Padre Fray Juan de Jesús is in such a state, because of his quartan fevers, that I don't know what he could do; nor do you say what services he might be able to render. As for the college there, let us begin with what matters most, which is that the nuncio grant his permission. Once he has given it, the main thing is done. If mistakes are made in the beginning everything will be wiped out. What the bishop is requesting, in my opinion -- since he knows that Señor Juan Díaz is in Madrid and what he is doing there -- is to have someone in Salamanca who can do the same. And I don't know if our rule allows for your taking on the task of chaplains. It doesn't seem suitable to me, nor do I know what one could accomplish in two months, were the task to be accepted, other than annoy the bishop. Nor do I know how the Fathers would manage that kind of governing (for they will perhaps want to set high standards of perfection for that community, and such standards will not be suitable for those people). Nor do I know if the bishop would be pleased",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,1,0,6,0,3,12,0,1,0,12,10,17,20,8,2,2,0,0,2,0,0
"538",1576,65,"to have the friars.
13. I tell you there is more to do than you think and where we plan on gaining we will perhaps lose. Nor do I think our order will be seen as responsible if friars who are to be seen as contemplative hermits take on these chaplaincies -- for the friars are not wanted for any other reason -- and move about here and there with these kinds of women. I don't know how this will look, even though these women will be rescued from an evil way of life.
14. I raise these objections so that all of you there may consider them and then do what seems good to you, for I submit to that. You will arrive at a better decision. Read this passage to Señor Licentiate Padilla and to Señor Juan Díaz, for I don't know anything more to say than this. Permission from the bishop will always be sure in coming. Otherwise, I don't have confidence in Señor DonTeutonio as a great negotiator -- in his good will, yes; in his abilities, no.
15. I have been looking forward to being there so as to move this project along, for I am good at bargaining (if you don't think so, my friend Valdemoro will tell you). I wouldn't want the project to fail from your not explaining it well, for I have greatly desired that you have a house in Salamanca and one in Madrid. That you set aside thoughts of a foundation in Ciudad Real for a more opportune moment made me happy. I see no way in which it could have turned out well. All things considered, Malagón would be a much better place. Doña Luisa is eager to have you come and will provide well for your needs as time goes on, and there are many large towns in the surrounding area. I know you will not lack food.
16. And to have a justifiable pretext for abandoning the house in Madrid you could transfer it to Malagón. Let them think for now that you are not abandoning it definitively but only until the work on the house is completed. For you would appear irresponsible were you to start something one day and give it up the next.
17. I gave Don Jerónimo the letter for Don Diego Mejía. He will send it with another for the Count of Olivares. I will write him again when I see that it's necessary. Don't let the matter be forgotten. And I repeat that",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,3,1,2,0,5,15,0,1,4,16,5,12,12,9,6,1,0,0,1,0,1
"539",1576,66,"if he said clearly he would take it up and has discussed it with the archdeacon and considers it as good as done, he is a man of his word.
18. Now he has written me in favor of an aspirant. Would to God the two we let go had possessed her gifts; we wouldn't have had to refuse them. Father Visitator's mother has inquired about her. In mentioning this, it occurs to me that it would be good, under the pretext of saying something to Don Diego about this nun, to speak to him about the other matter and entrust it to him again. That is what I will do. Send the letter on to him. And remain with God, for I've really been lengthy, as though I had nothing else to attend to.
19. I'm not writing to Father Prior, because I have many other letters to write now, and he can consider this one as being for himself. Best regards to my Padre Padilla. I am giving much praise to our Lord because he is well. May His Majesty be with you always. I will strive to procure the document even if this means talking to Valdemoro -- and that would be doing a lot, for I don't believe he would do anything for us.
Today is the feast of the Virgins.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
20. Today they gave me other letters from you before Diego arrived. Send this letter to our padre with the first messenger; it's for some permissions. I am not writing anything to him about those business matters. So don't fail to write to him yourself about them.
21. That you may see whether or not my nuns surpass yours, I am sending you a section of a letter from the prioress in Beas. See the nice house she has found for the friars in La Peñuela; it has indeed given me great satisfaction. Surely, you would not have found one so quickly. They have accepted a nun whose dowry is worth 7,000 ducats. Two others are ready to enter with just as much. And they have already accepted a woman of illustrious background. She is the niece of the Count of Tendilla. The silver objects she has sent, the candelabra, cruets, and many other things, a reliquary, a crystal cross would all take too long to enumerate.
22. And now a lawsuit has been initiated against the nuns there, as you will find out in these letters. See what you can do. It would",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,2,9,0,1,14,0,0,1,10,2,11,10,5,3,3,0,0,0,1,0
"540",1576,67,"be important to speak to Don Antonio about this. Mention how high the grates are and that having the window open is more important to us than trying not to bother them. Well, see what you can do. To Padre Maestro Fray Jerónimo de la Madre de Dios, prior of Los Remedios.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. Today I received three letters from you by way of the chief courier and yesterday those that Fray Alonso brought. The Lord has repaid me well for the time it took them to arrive. May he be forever blessed that you are well. At first I was alarmed, for they gave me the packets from the prioress and I didn't see any letter from you in either of them. You can imagine what I felt. I was quickly put at ease. Always tell me which ones of mine you receive because you often do not respond to anything I ask you, and then on one letter you forgot to put the date.
2. In another, you ask me how I got along with Señora Doña Juana, but I had written to you about that through the mail carrier from here. I think your answer will come through the letter you say you sent me by way of Madrid, and so I am not very bothered by this. I am well, and my Isabel is our sole entertainment. It's extraordinary how gentle and cheerful she is. Yesterday, Señora Doña Juana wrote me. They are all well.
3. I have praised the Lord much over the way our business affairs are proceeding, but I was astonished by the things Fray Alonso told me they say about you. God help me! How necessary your trip was. Even if you did nothing else there, I think you were obliged in conscience to do so for the good of the order. I don't know how they were able to publish such great calumnies. May God give them light. If you had someone you could trust, it would be very good for you to grant them the favor of appointing another prior. But since you don't have anyone, I'm amazed at the one who gave you that advice. It would be like doing nothing. How wonderful it would be to have someone there who would not contradict everything. And if there does happen to be someone, it would be a real trial if the present prior refused to step down. Well,",1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,9,0,4,23,1,3,0,6,8,10,13,6,2,3,1,0,0,0,0
"541",1576,68,"they're not known for having a desire to be held in little esteem.
4. It's no surprise. I'm more surprised that with so many things to do Paul has time to attend to the affairs of Joseph with so much calm. I praise the Lord greatly. Tell him that he should now be content with his prayer and not bother with the work of the intellect when God is favoring him in another way, for I am very happy over what he writes me. The fact is that in these interior things of the spirit what is more acceptable and certain is what leaves the best effects. I do not mean immediately with respect to many desires. Even though these are good, they do not at times amount to all that our self-love paints them to be. What I mean by the best effects are those confirmed by works and that the desires for the honor of God become apparent in an authentic solicitude for it and that the intellect and memory be occupied in how best to please him and show him the love one has for him.
5. Oh, this is real prayer, and not some delights for the sake of nothing more than our own satisfaction. And when these kinds of delight are present, they are accompanied by laxity and fears and feelings that we are not being esteemed sufficiently. I would not want any other prayer than that which makes the virtues grow in me. If it should be accompanied by great temptations, dryness, and trials leaving me with greater humility, I would consider it good prayer. That prayer is the best prayer that pleases God the most. It shouldn't be thought that he who suffers isn't praying, for he is offering this to God. And often he is praying much more than the one who is breaking his head in solitude, thinking that if he has squeezed out some tears he is thereby praying.
6. Pardon me for such a long message, but your love for Paul will enable you to bear it. And if you think what I say is good, tell him about it, and if not, don't. But I speak of what I would like for myself. I tell you works and a good conscience are a great thing.
7. I was amused by what happened to Padre Joanes. It could be that the devil had desired to do him some harm and that God had drawn some good from this. But the greatest",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,18,0,6,33,1,1,2,13,4,16,11,5,0,2,3,1,0,2,0
"542",1576,69,"caution is necessary, for I am certain that the devil will search out every device he can to harm Eliseo. And so it is good to see one of Patillas's tricks there. Thus I don't think it would be harmful to pay little attention to these things. If the purpose is to make Joanes do penance, God is already giving, and has given, him enough. He's not the only one to whom this happened, for his three councilors have also soon had to pay for it.
8. What Joseph then said for certain was that Clemente did nothing wrong, that if he had a fault it was due to his illness, and that in that region where they sent him he was at peace and that Joseph had previously told him about the trial they had planned to inflict on him. Laurencia learned nothing about it from Joseph, but knew only what the people were saying elsewhere. I don't think Joseph would reveal his secrets in that way, for he is very prudent. For my part I think they are calumniating him and the more I hear it said that he is speaking from other sources -- which she couldn't verify -- the more it seems to me to be Patillas's project. I am amused to see where he now casts his net. Why did he have to free him from his beatas so that his soul would make better progress? It would be good to ask for this freedom from the angel, although I would be happy if Patillas were cast out of this house by the means that are usually used. Be careful, for he will show who he is. I will place the matter before God. Angela in another letter will tell what she has thought about this matter. It was very wise to deal with this business under the seal of confession.
9. It will be necessary to make San Jerónimo eat meat for a few days and give up prayer, and tell her not to speak to anyone but you, or that she write to me, for her imagination is weak and what she meditates on she thinks she sees or hears. Sometimes, though, what she says will be true and has been, for she is a very good soul.
10. And I think that the same goes for Beatriz. I don't believe that what they write me about the date of her profession is a whim but very good. She, too, should fast only sparingly.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,3,1,4,10,0,7,16,0,1,0,16,8,10,9,6,3,8,0,0,2,0,1
"543",1576,70,"Give these orders to the prioress telling her that from time to time she have them give up prayer and occupy themselves with other tasks so that things don't get worse; and believe me, this is necessary.
11. It made me sad that the letters were lost. And you do not tell me whether those that fell into the hands of Peralta were important. You should know that I am now sending a mail carrier. I have greatly envied the nuns for the joy they have had in hearing your sermons. It surely seems they deserve this; and I, the trials. Nonetheless, may God give me many more for love of him. I was troubled that you have to go to Granada. I would like to know how long you will be there, how I should write to you or where. For the love of God, keep me informed.
12. No signed blank sheets of paper have arrived. Would you send me a couple. I don't think I'll need them, for I see the work you have to do; and I would like to take on some of it so as to give you a little more quiet. May God give you the rest I want you to have and the holiness that he can give you, amen.
Today is 23 October.
Your paternity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. I already answered your letters, which arrived in good condition through the mail carrier, and they were a delight for me. But I am writing again because I'm sorry about your illness. For goodness' sake write me at once about your health and about what you know concerning our padre. I have envied your general confession. You certainly didn't have as much to confess as I, for I wouldn't have been able to make it so easily. Blessed be God who loves us all.
2. My brother writes in a letter I received today that he has written you and sent someone to collect a third of the amount you owe him. He is well and the purchase of the property has been finalized. The nuns at St. Joseph's are not faring badly. Teresa writes to me from there. The agnusdei and the rings that I was at first worried about have reappeared, glory be to God. I am well, but soon the clock will strike 1 a.m. and so I will not be long.

3. Last week they sent some fresh tuna from Malagón and it was very good and we enjoyed it. I have not broken the fast since the feast of the Holy Cross; see how well I am! Our prioress in Malagón, who has written me that she is better, did so, saint that she is, to console me. Her improvement has not amounted to anything. Today I received a letter from her, and she is very sick with severe nausea, which makes matters all the worse because of her weak condition. We are praying fervently for her, but my sins are great. I know there's no need to ask you to pray for her, but I'm doing this with all the communities.
4. Doña Guiomar was married today. She is delighted to know that you are doing well, and so is Doña Luisa, who has never shown me such love, and her concern for my comfort is by no means slight. Pray for them, and give my fondest regards to all the sisters.
5. I am worried about those monasteries our padre has charge of. I am now offering him the help of the discalced nuns and would willingly offer myself. I tell him that the whole thing is a great pity; and he immediately tells me how you are pampering him. May God preserve you for me. Warn him not to eat with those friars, for goodness' sake. I don't know why he goes down there, unless to provide us all with trials. I have already told you to take what you spend on him from the sum of money sent by St. Joseph's. You see, it would be foolish to do otherwise. And I know what I am saying. The money will be repaid without your realizing how. Don't do anything else. Let the good subprioress keep track of everything; she could do so even of the water. Regards to her and to my Gabriela. May God be with all of you.
6. With what the sister brings, and as much as you can add to it, pay at once on the house so that you will not have such high interest payments, which are a heavy burden, for even if they don't want ... For Padre Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián, apostolic commissary for Carmel.

"545",1576,72,"how well I obey! Sometimes I even wonder if I have this virtue, for if one gives me an order in jest, I want to take it seriously. And I carry out the orders more eagerly than I do this letter-writing, for all the bustle involved is killing me. I don't know how I found time for what I have written, and I have not failed to find some for Joseph either, who is the one who gives me strength for everything.
2. I am also fasting, for the cold in this area is not bad, and so it doesn't do me the harm that it does elsewhere. For goodness' sake, give my Padre Fray Antonio best regards from me; although it would be better, if possible, not to let him know that I am writing so much to you and so little to him. Perhaps I will write him a few words.
3. Had San Telmo taken the matter of his nun as Nicolao did, I wouldn't have had to bear so much. I tell you I don't know what to think, for we are not becoming saints in this life. If you could only see the qualities of the first nun, which make her acceptable, and how San Telmo treats the prioress. May it please God, mi padre, that we will have need for no one else but God himself. At least, San Telmo would not get any cooperation from me, even if the whole world were to collapse, since I see how this goes against my conscience. And, nonetheless, he says that he is no more interested in her than he would be in some stranger passing by on the street. What a life! And what would he do if he were interested in her. I would be afraid to take in someone that he proposes.
4. Mariano is frightened by it, and because I think he will write to you, I have mentioned it so you will not worry; we've done more than we should have. Well, he will come to know the truth, and if he doesn't, it matters little. What matters to me for my tranquility is that God keep you very holy.
5. Today is the vigil of All Saints. All Souls Day is the anniversary of my receiving the habit. Ask God to make me a genuine Carmelite nun, for better late than never.

6. The enclosed sheet of paper has a carol in honor of the saints that the nuns are sending you as an expression of their desire to have you here. They say that for some days God has been doing everything they ask of him here. From what I've seen, they are right. 1. Jesus be with your reverence, my daughter. For love of God, try to find out when our padre receives a letter from me, even though I almost never fail to write to you when writing to him. A letter of his delivered today, written on 22 October, says he hasn't received one from me for a long time -- and I don't do any thing but write. I wrote at length especially when I could use the muleteer's services. I wouldn't want someone to get hold of them. If they were lost, that wouldn't matter so much. Perhaps they are held up in the house of the chief courier down there, for they definitely leave from here. You should inquire there at times to see if they have any letters.
2. Before I forget, the large agnusdei and the rings have shown up. The nuns are all doing well in Avila as you will see by these enclosed letters. My brother tells me he was delighted with your letters, and he laughed a great deal and showed them to the nuns at St. Joseph's. He is going to write to you, for he is very fond of all of you. And I tell you that I am too.
3. You tell me that Nicolao is helping you all very much and that he will be confessor to the nuns. That is very good. Be kind to him, and write and tell me whether you are well, and not in roundabout ways but truthfully.
4. As for the health of the prioress in Malagón, I don't know what to say to you but that she is very bad. There has been talk now of bringing her here, but the doctor here says that doing so would only hasten her end. The illness is of the kind for which God alone is the true doctor. The locality does nothing either positively or negatively in such an illness. I am advising them again not to drink sarsaparilla water.
5. I wrote to Garciálvarez and a great deal to our padre about him. Tell me in detail how everything is going for you and",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,1,1,0,11,0,4,15,0,0,3,4,2,9,10,11,4,5,1,0,5,1,2

Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus To The Most Honorable Señor Francisco de Salcedo.
My lord,
1. Jesus be with you. Glory to God that after six or eight letters dealing with business matters that couldn't be avoided, I have a little time to rest from them by writing these lines to let you know I receive much consolation from your letters. Do not think that writing to me is time lost, for now and then I need this, provided that you don't keep telling me that you are old, which leaves me in total dismay. As though there were some security in being young! May God let you remain here until I die; afterward, so as not to be there without you, I will beg the Lord to bring you there quickly.
2. Would you speak to this padre, I beg you, and help him in this matter, for although he is small, I know that he is great in the eyes of God. Certainly we will miss him very much here, for he is wise, and just right for our way of life. I believe our Lord has called him for this task. There's not a friar who does not speak well of him, for he had been living a life of great penance, even though he is young. It seems the Lord is watching over him carefully, for although in trying to get everything settled we met with a number of troubles -- and I myself must have caused trouble at times by becoming annoyed with him -- we never saw an imperfection in him. He's courageous, but since he is alone, he needs all that our Lord gives him for taking this work so much to heart. He will tell you how we are getting along here.
3. The generous sum of six ducats seemed to be no small thing, but I would give much more to see you. Surely you are worth a higher price than I; who is going to value a poor lowly nun? In addition, you are to be prized more in that you can give aloja, wafer cookies, radishes, and lettuce, that you have an orchard and take the place of your servant -- I know about it --",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,5,15,1,10,14,1,1,4,8,5,6,8,9,4,3,0,2,4,0,2
"548",1576,75,"to bring us apples. The aloja here, they say, is very good, but since I don't have Francisco de Salcedo here, we don't know what it tastes like nor do we have the means of knowing. I'm telling Antonia to write you, for I'm not able to go on at length. Remain with God. I kiss the hands of Señora Doña Mencía and Señora Ospedal.
4. May it please the Lord that the improved health of that married gentleman continue. You shouldn't be so incredulous, for prayer can do all things, and the kinship he has with you will do a lot. Here, we will help with our widow's mite. May the Lord bring it about as he can. Indeed, I think the illness of his wife is more incurable. The Lord can cure it all. I beg you, tell Maridíaz, and the Flemish woman, and Doña María de Avila -- for I would very much want to write her, and surely I don't forget her -- when you see them, to recommend me and this monastery to God. May His Majesty keep your honor many years for me, amen. For, in passing, it might be said that this year could go by without my seeing you again, the Princess of Eboli being in such a hurry.
Your lordship's true and unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
5. I beg again as an alms of you that you speak to this padre and counsel him on what you think about his mode of life. The spirit the Lord has given him has greatly encouraged me, and his virtue, among so many troubles, makes me think we have a good beginning. His prayer is deep and he has good intelligence. May the Lord lead him on. I tell you, my daughter, that before you knew about it, I believe his soul was freed from purgatory. Every day just after I had received communion, he would come to me, and when the news arrived -- despite the distance -- I understood who it was. 1. ... Now she tells me she has the money she owes you. ... She doesn't dare send it to you until you have chosen someone to whom she can entrust it and who will show her a letter from you. Be on the watch, then, for the day when the muleteer leaves there. If he is trustworthy, it would be best for him to bring the money, or better, deliver it. Antonio Ruiz must go ... from Malagón. He",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,3,16,0,1,17,0,0,0,9,3,8,9,7,3,3,1,1,3,1,1
"549",1576,76,"would be delighted because this is not the suitable time for proceeding with work on the house, and so he has nothing to do in Malagón. It's better that he hurry things along down there. You would be doing him a favor by providing him with a way out of his difficulties, and you would be losing nothing. In beginning this letter, I was thinking more of helping these poor people, who are so good, out of their difficulties, than of your gain. But I would also like to see you become very rich, since you spend it so well. And even this morning the thought came to me that you should not have your boys marry soon, so that you can do more for your own soul. If you begin to get entangled in other expenses, you won't have enough for everything. And, after all, this is the recompense you deserve for all the trouble you went through to earn it: to spend as much as you can in the service of the One ... who will give you his kingdom, which death cannot take away. His Majesty ...
2. ... interior spiritual trials you are much better prepared ... in both natural disposition and spirit. ... It's necessary always to show him much kindness, for he soon thinks he is being a bother. I don't know if I could assert that he is the person in my life to whom I am most indebted in every respect, for I began to be greatly enlightened by him, and so I am very fond of him. I am distressed he doesn't bear the trial sent him by the Lord over this lawsuit with greater courage, for I can't believe that it comes from some other source.
3. Pray that God will enlighten him so that he will not be upset. This is what happens when one is not detached from everything. That which could be for us the greatest gain (the loss of property, which lasts for so short a time and is so undeserving of esteem when compared to what is eternal) disturbs and deprives us of this very gain. We have to realize that anyone to whom God has not granted such a favor will receive no consolation from our speaking like this. Rather he will be consoled if he sees we are sorry about his affliction.
4. Today, while thinking of how God distributes his blessings as he wills, I was amazed that a man like this who",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,5,9,1,11,18,3,1,3,10,4,11,6,7,2,1,0,0,1,0,0
"550",1576,77,"has served God so sincerely for so many years should become afflicted about losing goods that he considered as belonging more to the poor than to himself. While I was thinking that this would matter little to me, I recalled how disturbed I became when, while we were in Seville, we learned that you were in danger of losing all that you had brought back with you. And so it is that we never know ourselves. Thus the best thing to do is to forsake all for the All. And then our human nature will not make us slaves of such base things. Those who cannot give up everything should reflect often on how we become the slaves of these things. You should do this too, and remember how your human nature drew you ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with you. If you would believe what I tell you once in a while, we could avoid a lot of trouble. Did I not insist the other day in a letter that you not have yourself bled anymore! I don't know what nonsense has got into you, even though the doctor does give his consent. Your illness has been very distressing to me since the affliction is in your head. Now, about Catalina, you must pray for her, and not because she wants to go there, where I know she is very much loved. I tell you, this woman is a great person. Please God she will not have to pay dearly for all this affection she has for you. This is what passed through my mind, and I'm telling you so that you will repent.
2. I've received all your letters. They arrive in good condition this way. There is no need for you to send money to cover the portage, for I can take care of it with what my brother gives me. I owe him so much in every way. Our Father Visitator is well, for a letter from him arrived two days ago. He is solicitous about writing me, and up to the present he is getting along well with those people. But he carries out his office with much discretion and gentleness. Many days have now gone by since that matter with the Franciscans, and they haven't killed their visitator.
3. The news regarding Bishop Quiroga is true, and we are delighted because our padre has an excellent rapport with him. Now the bishop and the nuncio are very sick. Pray",2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,0,4,9,1,8,15,3,2,2,13,9,10,3,10,0,0,0,1,3,1,0
"551",1576,78,"for them, for we would miss them very much, and the bishop would be a loss to the entire kingdom. Pray also for Don Juan of Austria, for he went to Flanders disguised as the valet of a Fleming.
4. Oh, how pleased you made me by telling me of the health of Padre Fray Pedro Fernández. I had been disturbed, for I had known about his illness but not about his recovery. I tell you, he does not resemble your friend by ingratitude, for with all he has to do, he takes care to write to me. And in everything, he thinks he's indebted to me, although in this regard your friend is much more indebted to me. Know that the care this friend takes of you will last until he finds someone else who pleases him. Be sure of this, no matter how much you take for granted.
5. If God hadn't held me back, I would have done what you wanted to do some time ago. God doesn't allow me to do this, from which I see that he of whom you speak is God's servant. So it is necessary to love him, for he deserves it, and along with him, all the other servants of God there are on earth. If we think we're worth more than they, we're being really foolish. But this does not mean we should resemble him, but rather that we must always be grateful for the good that is done for us. So, forget about all these niceties and don't fail to write to him, but strive little by little to have an inner freedom, of which, glory to God, I now possess a good deal; but you are not as free as you say. Blessed may he be who is always a true friend when we desire his friendship.
6. The letter will be delivered to Luis de Cepeda. I have already written you that his father also died and of how much we prayed here for his father during the illness. Send me the account you say you have prepared for my brother (for I gave him the one Señora Doña María de Mendoza gave me), and send me the other accounts also with all your recollections. And, when you are up to it, prepare a report on Estefanía like the one you sent to Avila, for that was very well done. The handwriting should be good, so that I don't have to get someone here to make a copy.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,4,9,1,5,23,1,0,3,7,6,11,6,12,1,3,0,0,3,1,0
"552",1576,79,"And don't entrust it to Juliana, for, because of exaggeration, the silly and nonsensical things she said in the report about Beatriz de la Encarnación were unbearable. But when you are well, write down what you know, for the provincial has ordered this to be done.
7. I am well, glory to God. There's no way of persuading you, when you need a purgative, to take that syrup, the ""King of the Medes."" It has given me new life, and there's no harm it can cause you. Do not send the accounts by ordinary mail, or even think about doing so, but with the muleteer, even though this means a delay, for nothing would get here.
8. Concerning what you say about your interior life, the greater the disturbance the less attention you should pay to it, for it clearly proceeds from a weak imagination and bad humor; and since the devil sees this, he adds his bit. But have no fear, for St. Paul says that God will not permit us to be tempted beyond what we can bear. And even though it may seem that you give consent, it's not so; rather, you will benefit from all of this. Continue with your cure, for love of God, and try to eat well, and don't remain alone thinking about nothing. Seek some diversion inasmuch as you can and however possible. I would like to be there, for there's much I would talk about for your entertainment.
9. How is it that you didn't write me about the trials of Don Francisco? I would have written him, for I owe him a great deal. When you see the Countess of Osorno, give her my regards, and regards also to my María de la Cruz, Casilda, and Dorotea, and to the subprioress and her sister. I don't know what should be done about that blind novice. I tell you it's a heavy hardship.
10. Indeed, Prádanos is a good friend. You do well to speak with him, even though they are now going to change the superior. If only they'd send Padre Domeneque back! How much I would like that for you. Write soon about how you are, and remain with God. As for the prioress, she has been sorry about your illness. We are all praying to His Majesty for you. When you write to Fray Domingo always give him my regards; and let me know how he is.

1. Jesus be with your reverence. Today the good Valdemoro was here, and I believe he is telling the truth when he speaks about our being friends, for that is what suits his purposes at present. He speaks to me a lot about St. Paul's persecution of the Christians and of what he did afterward. Were he to do for God one tenth of what St. Paul did we would forgive him for both the past and the future. He tells me he is going to ask you to accept his brother.
2. Certainly, if what he says is true, and in view of your need for preachers, it would be to your advantage to have him. But I fear that since our padre in his visitations sends away those who come from other orders, he would not hear of admitting this person into his own order. What I can do in exchange for the friendship is pray for him. You can judge up there what would be the most fitting thing to do.
3. We are praying hard for the sanctification of those lords. May God bring this about according to whatever need he sees. I am worried about the trials of our good Padre Padilla. The devil will not give up waging war against works as great as those he's doing. May God grant him fortitude and health, and may he make you and Padre Maestro very holy.
4. I haven't learned anything new about the business affairs. I think you would learn about them there first. Tomorrow I will be giving Valdemoro, who is going to Madrid, a letter addressed to you. If in it I make a request in favor of his brother, my ultimate desire is that you do what renders the most service to God.
These little friars are like saints. Seeing souls like this is a great consolation, and gives one strength to suffer the trials that could come upon us.
It is 3 November.

3. You should know that Perucho was here two days ago. He says that St. Paul persecuted the Christians and that still God touched his heart and that he can do the same for him making him turn over a new leaf. I think he will continue as long as it's convenient for him.
He's absolutely certain that Paul will come as visitator against them. He says he will be the first to give him a good welcome, that he has a brother whom the night owls expelled, a great saint and preacher, indeed without a fault, who was previously a Dominican; he wants him to join the eagles. If all this is true, it wouldn't do us any harm to take him, since we need preachers. The bad part is that it all seems to me to be a fable. Oh, what a great friend I have in him! God deliver us.
4. The one who is giving the property for the monastery would like them to say a Mass for him once a week, and he will provide for the construction of six nice cells. I told him you would not agree to this. I believe he will be content with less and even perhaps with nothing.
5. I am afraid of our losing Methuselah. Tell me what Angela ought to do if this should happen, for she will then be feeling scruples over obedience in regard to which monastery she should be living in. I see clearly that the one is in an out-of-the-way place and that Laurencia will be much worse off than where she is now, at least as regards her health. But it is really the place where her presence is most needed, so no attention should be paid to what pleases her, for on this earth it would be a mistake to take that into account. Well, her greatest",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,3,10,0,7,16,1,0,1,7,3,17,9,8,1,4,2,1,3,0,0
"555",1576,82,"happiness would lie in being near her confessor Paul, and there are more possibilities down there -- except for building a monastery. Where she is now is even worse than being in Avila as far as dealing with business matters goes. Whatever may be your decision, will you let her know it. If something were to happen and here they told her to go elsewhere, she would not be able to wait for your answer; and she would regret that very much.
6. Also consider if in the designation or choosing of a place for her, it would be fitting to take into account the monastery specified by the previous visitator, for apart from the need for her presence down there, it might be more perfect for her to go to that specified place than to decide on one by herself. So consider carefully, padre, what may be the suitable thing to do in this regard. For whether we make a mistake or do what is right the matter will be public. I don't think it will be long before we will have another Methuselah; but maybe it will be.
7. Oh, God help me! What great freedom this woman has in all that takes place. It doesn't seem that anything bad can happen to her or to her Paul. The words of Joseph are powerful, for they can produce results like this. But what learning and eloquence Paul has! It's something to praise God for. May you recommend all this to him, and answer me, for heaven's sake, for nothing is lost in following your counsel, and much could be lost in following other opinions. Let us pray hard for Methuselah and for the great angel, about whom I feel the most distress without my knowing why. May His Majesty give him health and preserve you for many years with great holiness, amen, amen.
Today is 4 November.
Your paternity's unworthy subject and true daughter.
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress, María de San José.
1. Jesus be with your reverence. I don't have time to say all that I would like. Today the muleteer gave me your message. The longer your letters are the happier they make me. I have received so many letters today that there isn't even time to write this, nor have I had time to read the sisters' letters. Give them my best regards.
2. I already wrote you to tell you to accept Garciálvarez's sisters. It seems to me that my letter should have arrived. If they are",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,2,13,0,7,15,1,0,3,16,5,13,19,5,0,1,2,0,1,0,0
"556",1576,83,"so good, there is no reason for waiting. I am distressed that you are taking in so many nuns without any improvement in your financial picture. Try at least to get those 300 ducats that you are obliged to pay this year, for I assure you it bothers my conscience that you do not give poor Antonio Ruiz his money. He needs this for food for himself and for his livestock in Malagón. I'm already trying to find someone to help him out with more -- and this is my brother, although he will also benefit from so doing -- for I see that he has so little to count on there.
3. Even were the postulant recommended by Padre Nicolao not so perfect, I wouldn't send her away. Give him my regards and tell him that his cousin came to see me and sent an alms.
4. As for Pablo, I don't know what to say, for I still haven't understood well -- until I read the letter again -- why there is such a hurry before the year is up. If they give you 1500 ducats besides what they owe you for this year, give up the inheritance gladly. For these inheritances are never good for us because they end up amounting to nothing. And don't accept the inheritance, but he must take responsibility for that part which they are giving for the house. Don't let it enter your mind to take the inheritance. Say that you can't, that you are not allowed to have an income. Well, you shouldn't be writing me about these things; consider down there what's best for you to do. I wouldn't want anything to be withdrawn from that dowry or from Beatraiz's, but that the entire sum be given together. Otherwise I don't know how you can carry on with all that you have to pay every year, and instead of getting out of difficulties, you will lose a great deal. As for the lay sister, I will write to Valladolid to vouch for her and then write you again soon.
I am well.
The date is 8 November.
5. I will put the letters for our padre in an envelope without an address and with your name on it and two or three crosses; better two, or one, since the letters are numerous. And ask him not to address his letters to me but let you address them and mark them with the same sign. Doing this will conceal them better and make for",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,4,11,1,0,4,16,1,1,1,7,7,8,7,7,3,2,0,0,0,0,1
"557",1576,84,"a better plan than the one I had suggested. Please God you are speaking the truth when you say you are well, and remain with him.

Teresa of Jesus
6. I have written you that your letters were given to my brother, and he was delighted with them. He is well, and the prioress of St. Joseph's remains the same.  
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. Last week while we were within the octave of All Saints, I wrote to you of how I rejoiced in receiving your letter, even though it was short, which was the last that I received. Regarding what you mentioned about writing to Rome, please God the result will be positive and that no other opinions will stand in the way.
2. I also mentioned how delighted I was with the letters you wrote to Padre Mariano which he sent me at my request. It's a story that made me give God much praise. I don't know how you are able to think up such ingenious tricks. May he be blessed who gives you such ability, for it seems to be his work. So, you must always consider carefully the favor God bestows on you and not go about trusting in yourself. I tell you that Buenaventura was so confident in himself that everything seemed easy (which scared me when I heard about it), yet it didn't do him any good.
3. This great God of Israel wants to be praised in his creatures. Thus we need to seek, as you do, what is for his honor and glory and be as diligent as we can not to seek any for ourselves. His Majesty will take care of us as he sees is fitting. What behooves us is that we understand our lowliness and that in that lowliness his grandeur be exalted. But how foolish I am, and how you will laugh, mi padre, when you read this! May God pardon those butterflies who enjoy so peacefully what I could not enjoy there except through much hardship. I can't help envying them, but it is a great joy for me that they are so diligently seeking to provide some relief for Paul, and so inconspicuously.
4. I have already written you many foolish counsels. If you wanted to get even with me, you would have to stop giving me the relief I find in your being able to get some relief for yourself, for you need it so badly in the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,14,0,7,34,1,2,2,7,8,8,9,7,1,3,0,0,0,0,0
"558",1576,85,"midst of such great hardship. But my Paul has more virtue than this, and understands me better than before. That there be no occasion for failing in this understanding, I ask that you refuse to be my chaplain except for this purpose. This is so, for I tell you that if I had suffered all the trials involved in this foundation for no other reason, I would consider it to have been well worthwhile. And again it makes me praise the Lord that he granted me the favor of your having a place there where you can get your breath without being with seculars. Those sisters give me great pleasure, and you do me a great favor, by having them write with such detail, for they say you have given them orders to do so. It is a consolation for me to see that you don't forget me.
5. Doña Elena has combined her daughter's share of the inheritance with what she will bring as a dowry if she enters. And she says that the amount should be sufficient for accepting herself, two other nuns, and two lay sisters, and that after the work on the house is completed the remainder should be used for a pious foundation like that of Alba. The truth though is that she submits entirely to what Padre Baltasar Alvarez, you, and I decide. It was he who sent me this information, for he didn't want to respond before finding out what I would say. I paid careful attention to what I have seen as your will and so, after much reflection and discussion, I gave this enclosed response. If it doesn't seem right to you, let me know. Notice that I do not want to see the houses that were founded in poverty having an income.
May God keep watch over you.
Your unworthy daughter and servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress, María de San José.
1. Jesus be with you reverence. Always include on a small piece of paper a list of the things you want me to answer. Your letters are long -- although they don't seem so, because of the joy they give me; but if when in a hurry I have to read them all over in order to answer them, they do seem long.
2. I wrote you two, three, or four days ago that I would put two crosses on the letters for our padre but with your address. Let me know when you receive this message because I will not",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,3,4,8,0,2,17,0,0,2,18,10,12,9,6,4,3,0,1,0,0,0
"559",1576,86,"start doing this until then.
3. I tell you that I am very sorry about your fever. Why do you tell me that you are well? I'm bothered by that. But take care to see if it isn't caused by amenorrhea, and do something about it. Don't let it take root. I strongly suspect that it leaves you at times; this consoles me. I suggest you apply some ointments or things to mitigate the fever, and don't fail to tell the doctor. I think you usually have yourself bled every year. Perhaps this would benefit you, as the subprioress says. What I'm telling you is not to stay in the state you are in, waiting until it will be too late for a remedy. May God make you well.
4. I haven't heard anything from Malagón for days. I'm worried, and the doctors don't give me any hope for the prioress's return to health. All the signs and symptoms point to tuberculosis. God is life, and he can give it. Always keep praying for this -- also for a person to whom I owe a great deal -- and tell everyone to do so, and give them my regards, for their letters are a delight to me. I don't know if I will have a chance to answer them.
5. I tell you that I greatly envy all of you for the happy and peaceful way in which you enjoy the presence of our padre. I don't deserve such repose, and so I have no reason to complain. I am very glad that you have this relief, for if you didn't I don't know how you would be able to endure everything else. Nonetheless, I tell you to give orders to the subprioress in my name to subtract all the expenses from the forty ducats owed to St. Joseph's, and don't do otherwise, for you would be undergoing a loss. Consider what you spend as being taken care of here, and deduct from the debt whatever you spend on him. I laugh to myself thinking of how the good subprioress will include everything in the accounting, even the water. But she will be doing well, for that's what I want, except for the little gifts given as alms. I will become angry if you do otherwise.
6. You never tell me who his companion is. That's the only worry I have now, for I am very happy everything is going so well, without anyone's knowing about it. I wouldn't want it to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,7,3,0,9,19,2,3,2,11,8,11,15,9,1,2,0,0,7,0,1
"560",1576,87,"be known in Los Remedios where he is eating, for that would open the door to what cannot be allowed for another superior. Believe me it's necessary to consider the future so that we don't have to answer to God for something we ourselves have started.
7. I am concerned to see how those nuns you are taking in are not of any help to you. Padre Garciálvarez will have received by now the letter in which I say that his relatives should be accepted. And I have written one to you that you should try to have them bring some money to help pay the interest, for that inheritance must not be worth anything. I wouldn't want you to wait until you don't know where to turn next, but that you provide for yourself before discovering that you are in water over your head. I accepted a nun in Salamanca who, they told me, was bringing a dowry from which I could have sent 300 ducats to Malagón to pay what you owe them and pay the hundred to Asensio Galiano, but she has not come. Pray that God will bring her to us. I tell you that you owe me a great deal for my desire to see you free of worry.
8. Why don't you try to give that money from Juana de la Cruz at once so as not to be so burdened with debt? Consider how this is not something to neglect. Try to get Anegas to bring what you need to pay Antonio Ruiz, for as I have mentioned you are obliged in conscience to give him what you owe him considering his present need.
9. As for Pablo, I reread what concerned him. You mustn't let him think that you want his daughter, but that he should give up trying to have her enter. And realize that this is better for many reasons, for these business people have a lot of money one day, and the next day they lose it all. How much more so since parents look after those who are close to them, and little is left over. What is more fitting is that he pay you all that he still owes you for the house, if it amounts to 1500 ducats, and don't accept an inheritance or agree on a lesser amount. If you can get more from him, get it. Try to find someone who will tell him not to upset his children by leaving their inheritance to a",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,19,5,0,5,9,2,0,2,15,7,15,10,5,3,1,0,1,0,0,2
"561",1576,88,"monastery. Even if he gave 2,000 ducats, it would not be a lot.
10. They say that the mother of the Portuguese girl could give the dowry. I think that would be worth more than the others. Well, you will not be in want. At the moment you least expect, God will send you someone who will bring more than you want. It wouldn't be bad if that chaplain were to take responsibility for the major chapel. Don't fail to send him some gifts to show your gratitude, even though there be no occasion for doing so.
11. Before I forget, you ought to know that I learned here of some mortifications that are being performed in Malagón. The prioress will suddenly give an order that a sister be slapped by another. They got this notion from here. It seems the devil is teaching them under the guise of perfection to put souls in danger of offending God. By no means should you command or consent that any nun give another a slap (they also say pinches are given). Do not guide the nuns with the rigor you saw at Malagón, for they are not slaves. Mortification should be used only for one's growth. I tell you, my daughter, that it's necessary that you be very careful about what these little prioresses dream up. The things that I am now finding out! How this afflicts me! May God make you a saint, amen.
12. My brother is well, and Teresa too. The letter you wrote him in which you spoke of the four reales was not received; all the other letters were. He is delighted with them, and cherishes them more than the ones he gets from here.
Today is 11 November, and I am yours,
Teresa of Jesus
13. Try to get our padre to respond to the business matters I am writing him about in the enclosed letter. I mean that you insist with him that he not forget. 1. In a way, even though it deeply grieved me, it caused me profound devotion to observe, on the other hand, the tact you are using amid so many calumnies. I tell you, padre, God loves you very much and you are doing well in your imitation of him. Rejoice since he is giving you what you ask of him, which are trials, for which he will repay you because he is just. May he be blessed forever.
2. In what regards that girl or woman, I am convinced that it is due not",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,2,15,1,6,13,0,2,2,7,7,12,12,4,1,3,1,1,0,1,0
"562",1576,89,"so much to melancholy as to the devil. He is the one putting the woman up to those lies. He is trying to see if he can fool you in some way, now that he has fooled her. So you must proceed with great discretion in this matter and by no means go to her house. May what happened to Santa Marina (I believe it was) not happen to you, for they claimed a child was hers, and she suffered much. Now is not the time for you to be suffering in a matter like this. In my poor opinion you should set this matter aside, for there are others who might win over this soul, and there are many others toward whom you can be helpful.
3. Remember, padre, that if she didn't give you that letter under the seal of confession or in confession, it is a matter for the Inquisition, and the devil has a thousand snares. I have learned that someone else died in the Inquisition prison for the same reason. Truly I don't believe she gave the letter to the devil -- for he wouldn't have returned it so quickly -- or all that she says. But I believe she must be lying in some way -- God forgive me -- and enjoys seeing you. Perhaps I am calumniating her, but I would like to see you far away from where she is so that you can more easily protect yourself.
4. How malicious I am! But everything is necessary in this life. Don't try to straighten out a matter that's been going on for four months. Be careful, it's very dangerous. Let them fend for themselves. If there is anything to accuse her of in this regard (I mean outside of confession), be careful, because I fear there will be more publicity and they will blame you afterward, saying that you knew about it and were silent. But I'm aware that my saying this is foolish because you already know it ... To the Very Illustrious Doña Luisa de la Cerda, my lady.
1. May Jesus be with you, my lady and friend. However much this Doña Luisa may travel, she is still my lady. I have told Antonia to write to you about all that is happening, in regard both to my poor health and all the rest. My head is in such a condition that only God knows how I can write this. But knowing that you and my lords have arrived in",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,2,11,1,14,12,1,4,3,17,5,8,15,8,3,4,0,1,2,0,0
"563",1576,90,"good health so consoles me that my writing these lines is not taking much effort. May the Lord be blessed for everything; I prayed a great deal for all of you. I'm also much consoled that you are happy with your monastery. And I find that you are right, for I know that our Lord is genuinely served there. May it please him that the nuns serve you as they ought. And may our Lord keep you and allow me to see you again, since I did not die.
2. With regard to the book, you have worked everything out so well that it couldn't have been done better. So I'm forgetting all the anger this caused me. Master Avila wrote to me at length, and he is satisfied with everything. He says only that some things should be explained further and that some terms should be changed. This will be easy to do. You have done a good work; the Lord will repay you for this and for the other favors and good deeds you have done for me. I greatly rejoiced in receiving such good news, for this is an important matter. One recognizes who it was who counseled that the book be sent.
3. I would very much like to write to Padre Pablo Hernández, but I'm really not able to do so. I think I'll be rendering him a greater service if I do not make myself sick. I beg you to tell him about what's going on here that he might pray to the Lord for me and for all these business matters, for I do the same for him. I also beg you to send Sister Antonia's letter to the prioress of Malagón along with this one, if you do not object. Otherwise, have someone write her that she should not become involved in the matter that I wrote about in a letter sent to her through Miguel, for the general has written to me again, and it seems that things will be going better. Note that it's very important you give her this message.
4. I kiss the hands of Señor Don Juan and my ladies many times. I welcome them back and also you; your return, I repeat, has made me happy. Give my best regards to Señor Don Hernando and Señora Doña Ana, and also to Alonso de Cabria and Alvaro del Lugo. You already know that with me you must lose something of your noble status and gain in humility. May",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,1,10,1,2,21,0,1,1,8,6,9,14,7,1,1,1,1,2,1,0
"564",1576,91,"it please the Lord that I might see you again, for I surely want to. My health and everything else I do fare better in your region than up here.
5. With regard to moving, it's important to be very careful about choosing a healthy site, as you can see from what's happening to us here because of the unhealthy location, even though the house is very pleasant.
6. I was happy that you gave an alms to that young girl. When it comes to your desire, you ought not bother about whether there is room or not, for everything belongs to you. Señora Doña María de Mendoza kisses your ladyship's hands many times. Before I had read to her what you wanted me to tell her, she begged me to convey this to you. She is not at home now. I will pass on what you wanted me to tell her, for she truly deserves it. Tell me whatever you think appropriate concerning the licentiate, our Padre Velasco, and remain with God. May he grant you all that I desire for you, amen.
Today is the day following the feast of All Saints.
Your ladyship's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus be with your paternity. Now see the tiresome decrees made by Padre Juan de Jesús. It seems to me he is just repeating what's in your constitutions. I don't know for what purpose. This is what my nuns fear, that some burdensome prelates will come along and crush them. Laying on heavy burdens accomplishes nothing. It's strange how visitators think they haven't made a visitation unless they have set down some decrees. If the friars were not to have recreation on the days in which communion is received, then those who say Mass daily would never have recreation. And if priests don't observe such a rule, why should the other poor friars have to?
2. He writes me that since he had never visited that house, all these things were necessary, and that must be so. In some matters he must have had to intervene. Still, I felt worn out just from reading the decrees. What would happen if I were obliged to observe them? Believe me, our rule doesn't bear up under rigorous people, for it is rigorous enough.
3. Salazar is going to Granada, something the archbishop arranged, who is a great friend of his. He has a great desire that a house of our nuns be founded there, and this would not displease me. Even if I didn't",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,4,5,1,9,0,5,12,1,1,0,7,8,17,12,12,3,1,3,1,4,1,0
"565",1576,92,"go, it could be done. But first I would want the foundation to be acceptable to Cyril, for I don't know if visitators can give permission for the foundation of houses of nuns as they can for friars. If only the Franciscans don't get there ahead of us as they did in Burgos.
4. You ought to know that Santelmo is badly annoyed with me on account of the nun who has now left, but in conscience I couldn't have done otherwise, nor could you have done anything. Everything possible was done in this matter, and when there is question of pleasing God, the world can crumble. I have no regrets, nor should you. We'll never gain anything good from going against the will of our Good. I assure you that even if she had been my Paul's sister -- which would be the highest recommendation -- I could not have done any more. He just refused to listen to reason. He is annoyed with me because I believe my nuns speak the truth. He thinks the prioress is partial and that his candidate was falsely accused about everything. He has arranged for her to enter a monastery in Talavera with others from Madrid, and so he sent for her.
5. God deliver us from having a need for creatures. And may it please him to help us see clearly without any other need than for him. San Telmo says that I have done this because I don't need him now, and that he has been told I am a crafty one. Notice that I needed him most when we were considering sending his candidate away, and how truly misunderstood I was. May it please the Lord that I understand how to do his will always. Amen.
Today is 19 November.
Your unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. On the feast of the Presentation of Our Lady two letters of yours were delivered to me along with those from our padre. Never fail to tell me something just because you think his paternity is telling me about it, for in fact he doesn't, and I am surprised that he writes to me at all with everything else he has to do. The letters you sent by way of Madrid, which contain the memorandum or note that tells about the commotion that has taken place, have not arrived. I don't think any of my letters were lost except the first packet where I told you about",2,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,10,0,5,10,0,2,3,14,8,17,15,12,1,3,0,0,0,0,0
"566",1576,93,"my Isabelita having received the habit and the happy moments I spent with her mother. Since there was also a letter there from the prioress and the sisters that presented some questions to our padre, and he has not answered, I think they were lost. Let me know through the next mail carrier. I mentioned that when I laughingly asked Isabelita if she were married, she answered very seriously that she was. I asked her with whom, and she answered at once, ""with our Lord Jesus Christ.""
2. I became very envious of those who went to Paterna, and it wasn't because they went with our padre. When I saw that their going there meant suffering, I forgot about the rest. Please God it will be a beginning for how he may use us. There are so few down there that I don't think they will suffer much, except from hunger, for I am told they don't have enough food to eat. May God be with them, for we have urgently begged him about this up here. Send them this letter through a very reliable messenger, and send me any of theirs you have so that I may see how things are going. Always write and encourage and counsel them. It's a harsh trial to be so alone. In no way do I think they should sing anything until their number increases, for this would bring discredit on all. I am delighted that Garciálvarez's aspirants have good voices. You ought to accept them with whatever they bring because you are few in number.
3. I am astounded by the absurdity of allowing the confessor to bring along with him any other confessor he wants. What a nice custom that would become! Since I have not seen the note from our padre, I cannot say anything. I had thought of writing to Garciálvarez to ask him that when he needs counsel he should not go to spiritual masters but search out some truly learned men, for these latter have rescued me from many troubles. I am not surprised about the sufferings of which you speak, for I have suffered much because they told me the devil was behind my experiences. So that you may see what I write to him, I will send the letter unsealed and you can send it to the prior of Las Cuevas. If you can speak to Acosta, I think that will be better. Read that letter and send it to him.

Even though sometimes what they say may not be to our liking, it's worth putting up with for the sake of the importance of having them with us. Think up questions to ask them, for they like to answer questions. And they are right in wanting to do well whatever they undertake. And they do so whenever they undertake a charge like this. In that chaos, this is something that takes on great importance, for when our padre leaves, you will be very much alone.
5. It never crossed my mind to want you to accept Nicolao's aspirant for any other reason than that I think you have a great need of money. If the 1,000 ducats from the relatives of Garciálvarez were in currency, it would be all right. It is good that they have to wait, although you shouldn't fail to accept them for reasons of money, in my opinion.
6. I was amused by the motive for which they are sending me to the Indies. May God pardon them. The best thing they can do is say so many things all at once that no one will believe them. I have already written you not to send the money to my brother until he writes to you. Try to get our padre to do what Acosta tells him with respect to the one who will be appointed the next rector of the Society, which will be soon. I entreated Salazar -- for he was here and is going to Granada and says he may possibly go to Seville -- to speak to the provincial down there. If he should come, be very gracious to him and speak to him about whatever you might wish. You can do so for he is a real gentleman.
7. The prioress of Malagón is better, glory to God, and I am much more confident about her health, for a doctor has told me that if the lesion is not in the lungs she will live. May God provide since he sees our need. Don't fail to pray for this. Recommend me to the prayers of all the nuns, and remain with the Lord, for I have many letters to write.

Teresa of Jesus
8. Always let me know how Padre Fray Antonio is. Regards to him, to Fray Gregorio and Fray Bartolomé. I give much praise to our Lord upon seeing what our padre is doing. May God be pleased to give him health. I hope in God that my daughters will fulfill their duties well. To the very magnificent Señor Luis de Cepeda, my lord, in Torrijos.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, amen. I received your letters and the four ducats. They will be delivered this week. May the Lord reward you for the care you take of our sister at the Incarnation, who is the one most in need. Because of the prioress's illness, Sister Beatriz de Jesús is now in charge of governing the house in Malagón, and she is very busy. She is doing extremely well, glory to God, for I didn't think she was capable of so much.
2. You shouldn't be surprised that you are not able to be very recollected in the midst of so many difficulties. That would be impossible. If you return to your good rule of life when they pass, I will be content. Please God that all goes very well with you, but do not be concerned about having more or having less, for even if a great deal is left for you, everything will soon come to an end. Ask the ladies there to remember me in their prayers; the prioress asks for yours.
Today is 25 November.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesús. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your paternity, and may he keep you, mi padre, for many years, amen. I tell you that if God hadn't given me understanding that all the good we do comes from his hand and how little we ourselves can do, it wouldn't be unusual for me to experience a bit of vainglory over all that you are doing. May God's name be ever blessed and praised forever, amen. The things that are happening are stupefying enough, but that you proceed with so much peace is what makes me marvel, and that you turn enemies into friends and make them the",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,24,0,3,27,1,1,0,5,5,9,13,12,1,0,1,1,4,0,0
"569",1576,96,"authors or, to put it better, the executors of your plans.
2. The choice of Padre Evangelista pleased me. For goodness' sake give him my regards and thank Paul for the recreation he afforded us with his poems and the letter for Teresa. I rejoiced that the matter concerning the cicadas was not true and that the butterflies went there. I hope in God that this will prove to have been very beneficial and I believe the number is sufficient for that place. They are the objects of much envy, for when it comes to suffering we all have great desires; may God help us to put our desires into practice.
3. It would have been a real trial had the spirit of that house been a bad one. Now you can see how much the spiritual people in that region are to be pitied. May God be blessed that you were there during the uproar. What would the poor things have done! Nonetheless, they are fortunate since they are already benefiting from something, and what you write about the archbishop's visitator I consider very important. This house will do nothing but great good, for it has cost us dearly. I don't think Paul is suffering anything in comparison with the fear he suffered on account of the angels.
4. I was very much amused to learn about your begging, but you haven't ever told me who your companion is. You say you were sending the letter to Peralta in the packets, but it didn't come. They did not give me the one that you addressed to Padre Mariano, nor has he written a word to me. It's been a long time since he has written me. He sent me a letter from you today without writing. Perhaps he has kept the one I'm speaking of and Garciálvarez's document. He also sent me one or two letters by way of Segovia. I thought they were from you, although the addresses were not in your handwriting. Afterward I saw that they were not from you. The news around here is that Methuselah has much improved, glory to God, and no longer has a fever. It's strange the way I feel, for nothing that happens can trouble me, so deeply rooted is the feeling of certitude about a successful outcome.
5. On the feast of the Presentation, I received two letters from you; afterward a very brief one that came with another for Doña Luisa de la Cerda, who is more than just a",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,2,4,9,0,10,17,1,1,4,9,5,5,8,5,2,2,2,0,2,0,0

6. Oh, how eagerly, according to what I'm told, would Angela have prepared food for Paul when he experienced that hunger of which he speaks! I don't know why he looks for more trials than God gives him by going about begging. It seems he has seven souls so that when one life comes to an end, there will be another. Scold him, for goodness' sake, and thank him on my behalf for the favor he shows me in taking so much care to write to me. May it be for the love of God.
Teresa of Jesus
What is happening now, although I believe Esperanza will have mentioned it ... 1. I sent a letter last week through the mail carrier from here in which I answered Paul concerning the scapular of the tongues. In speaking about it to Joseph, I was told to inform him that he has many enemies visible and invisible, that he should be careful. For this reason, I would not want him to trust so much in the Egyptians -- you tell him that -- or in the night owls. 1. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and give you the comfort that is necessary for what seems to us at this moment in time to be so great a loss. But the Lord who has willed this and loves us more than we do ourselves will make us understand in due time that he has brought about the greatest good possible for my cousin and for all of us who wish her well, for he always calls souls to himself when they are in the best condition to respond.
2. You ought not think of having a long life, for everything that finishes so quickly is short. But consider that your loneliness may not last long and entrust yourself completely into God's hands, for His Majesty will do what is most fitting. It is a great consolation to see a death that allows us to have such assurance that she will live forever. And have the belief that if the Lord now takes her to himself, it is so that you and your daughters will have more help since she is in the presence of God.
3. May His Majesty hear us, for we have prayed much for her, and enable you to be resigned to whatever he does and give you the",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,13,1,4,19,0,1,3,11,6,7,9,7,2,3,1,2,2,2,2

4. I'm sending two melons that I've found, but they're not as good as I would like them to be.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. ... Our Isabel is like an angel. The disposition and happiness of this creature are something to praise God for. Today the doctor happened to pass by a room where she was, for he usually doesn't go that way. Since she saw that he had seen her, even though she tried hard to take flight, she began to cry thinking she was excommunicated and that she deserved to be expelled from the house. We all had a good laugh about this and love her dearly, and with reason ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. Not long ago I answered your letters, which are not as many as mine to you. You have never written about the procedure our padre follows in making a visitation. Would you be kind enough to do this for me. Please God it is being carried out according to the plan that our padre says is used by the archbishop's visitator and by himself for his nuns; this would be most beneficial. Considering his earnest zeal, it would be impossible for His Majesty not to help him.
2. I greatly desire to know how my nuns in Paterna are doing. I believe they must be doing very well, and considering the news our padre will give you that Tostado is not going to be allowed to proceed, the reform promoted by the discalced nuns will not stop with this monastery alone. May God watch over our padre, for it seems miraculous the way things are going.
3. I was very pleased with the statement written by our padre concerning Garciálvarez, for there is nothing else that would have to be added to it. I haven't heard who was appointed rector. Please God he will be of the same mind as Padre Acosta. Since I wrote to you about this previously, I will not speak of it now or add anything, nor would I know what to say.
4. I didn't hear anything more about the prioress of Malagón since I last wrote, for they told me then that she had improved. Nor have I heard anything about Antonio Ruiz who had another relapse, but I believe that had he died I would have heard by now.
5. My best regards to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,14,1,3,19,0,0,2,13,9,10,9,3,3,7,1,0,2,1,0

6. Alberta has written to Doña Luisa and sent her a cross. I haven't written to her yet -- it's amazing how she delights in any little attention from her nuns -- nor to Doña Guiomar who is now married. Don't be a thankless one, and remain with God.
Today is 3 December 1576.
Your servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with you, mi padre. Each time I see letters arriving from your paternity, and how frequently they are coming, I would like to kiss your hands to thank you for having permitted me to remain in this place, for I don't know what I would have done without the relief of living here. May God be blessed for everything. Last Friday I answered some letters from you. Now I've received some more, the ones you wrote from Paterna and Trigueros. The later one was full of worries, and with every reason.
2. Despite all your motives for remaining there, I wish that after you have visited those marquises you would go to see the ""angel,""since the letter from him is so insistant, even though it would mean a hardship for you. For even if he is mistaken, these matters are difficult to deal with by letter, and we owe him so much. It seems that God has placed him there for our help, for error itself will turn to our benefit if we follow his opinion. Be careful, mi padre, for the love of God, not to displease him, for down there you are deprived of good counsel, and you would cause me much disturbance.
3. I am disturbed also to learn from the prioress how that ""saint"" is not carrying out the duties of his office well, and even more disturbed by his lack of courage. For love of God, tell him in a way that he will understand that justice will be rendered to him as well as to others.
4. I'm writing this in such a hurry that I am not going to be able to say all that I would like. I was forced to receive a visitor just when I was about to begin this letter, and now it is late at night, and the muleteer is going to deliver it. Since he is so reliable I don't want to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,13,0,7,16,4,0,1,9,10,12,10,5,3,2,1,1,1,3,0
"573",1576,100,"miss telling you again what I've already written to you -- that is, that the Royal Council has stipulated that Tostado is not to make a visitation of the four provinces. The one who wrote us about this has seen this ordinance, and his letter was read to me. However, I don't consider the one who read it to be very trustworthy. But I think he was in this case, and I don't think he had any reason for lying. Whatever the case, I hope in God that everything will go well, for the Lord is turning Paul into an enchanter.
5. If I had no other reason to serve the Lord than this, I would consider it a sufficient one. Certainly the way things are unfolding is admirable. You ought to know that for some time Esperanza has not been praising Paul to me, and now he wrote to speak wonders about him and wants me to give him my blessing. What will he do when he learns about how things have been dealt with at Paterna? Indeed, I marvel to see how the Lord is intermingling sorrows with joys, for this is the strait path along which his plans are brought about.
Teresa of Jesus
6. You should know, padre, that in a certain manner it is a delight for me when you tell me about your trials, although the matter of the calumny offended me deeply, not on account of what regarded you but on account of the nuns. Since the perpetrators are not finding anyone to be a witness, they are looking for someone who they think will not talk, but she will know how to defend herself, as well as her son Eliseo, better than anyone else in the world.
7. Yesterday a Father from the Society wrote me, as well as did a lady from Aguilar del Campo, a nice town thirteen leagues from Burgos. She is a sixty-year-old widow with no children. She has had a serious illness and, desiring to do a good work with her estate (which amounts to 600 ducats in income and a good house and garden), she was told about these monasteries. This appealed to her so much that in her will she left everything for this purpose. Well, she continued to live, but still has a great desire to found a monastery, and so she wrote to me asking that I give a reply. It seems to me to be far away, although perhaps God desires that this be",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,2,3,11,0,5,18,0,2,2,15,8,9,10,5,3,1,0,0,1,0,0
"574",1576,101,"done.
8. Also, in Burgos there are so many women who desire to enter that it is a pity there is no place for them to do so. Well, I will not discourage her but simply reply that I will seek more information about the locality and everything else until I see what you will ordain and if with your brief you can accept monasteries of nuns. For although I cannot go, you could send others. Don't forget to tell me what you decide to have me do in this regard.
9. I have someone in Burgos who can provide me with information. If she gives everything (which she will), it will easily amount to 9,000 ducats, and more with the houses added in, and the distance from Valladolid is not too great. It must be very cold there, but this lady says they have good hedges to protect themselves from it.
10. Oh, mi padre, how I would like to share with you those worries, and how well you do to complain to the one who becomes so afflicted over your sufferings. And how it pleases me to see you so close to the cicadas. The result there should be most fruitful. I hope in God that he will provide for them in their poverty. I want to tell you that San Francisco wrote me a letter that made a great deal of sense. May God be with them. Their affection for Paul pleased me very much, and I rejoice -- although not as much -- that he loves them. I already love the nuns in Seville and I love them more each day for the care they take of the one whom I myself would like to be taking care of and serving. May God be praised that he gives you such good health. Be on guard, for love of God, about what you eat in those monasteries. I am well and happy to have such frequent news of you. May His Majesty watch over you and make you as holy as I beg him to, amen.
Today is the eve of our Lady's Conception.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 
1. I, Teresa of Jesus, prioress of St. Joseph's in Avila, have received from the Most Reverend General, Master Fray Juan Bautista Rubeo, sufficient patent letters for founding and accepting monasteries of the primitive rule of the holy Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. I have been informed that in the city of Toledo, moved by the grace of",1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,15,0,4,26,1,0,2,8,6,10,9,3,3,1,1,0,1,4,2
"575",1576,102,"our Lord and aided by the Blessed Virgin, patroness of our order, some persons want to give this order an alms consisting of a house together with a church and four chaplains and everything else necessary for the divine service in the church. I am of the opinion that our Lord will be served and praised by this, and I therefore accept the offer as a work of charity and alms and sign my name below.
2. And if it should be necessary to negotiate certain matters regarding this agreement, as usually happens, I declare that if Father Superior and Padre Pablo Hernández are willing to do me this charity of working toward an understanding in these matters, I will accept the obligation to fulfill all that they arrange. And if they themselves should not want to enter into these negotiations, I will accept whomever they appoint; we must not fail in reaching an agreement since my going to that city would please the Lord.
3. And because these things are my desire, I declare that I will carry them out and attest to this with my signature.
Valladolid, 7 December 1568.
Teresa of Jesus, prioress
St. Joseph's in Avila,
Carmelite For Madre María de San José, prioress of Seville.
1. Jesus be with your reverence. Today, the vigil of the Immaculate Conception, the muleteer sent me your letters and is in a hurry for the reply. So, you will have to forgive me, daughter, if this is so short, for I wouldn't in any way want to be short with you, for whom my affection is great -- I certainly love you much. And now I am so obliged because of the care you take to provide our padre with every comfort, as he tells me; thus my love for you has even grown greater. And I am happy that you are doing this with such prudence, for I believe that neither now nor ever will there be another with whom we can deal in this way. Since the Lord chose him for these beginning stages, which are exceptional, I don't think there will be another like him. All that which serves to open doors will end up in something worse than can be imagined when superiors are not like him. But neither will there be so much need for caution, because now, as in a time of war, we need to proceed with more care. May God reward you, my daughter, for the care you take with your letters, which are a source",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,2,13,1,3,28,0,1,1,8,8,15,10,10,0,0,0,0,0,3,0
"576",1576,103,"of life for me.
2. This week I received all three that you said you had written. And even though they came all together, they are more than welcome. I was much moved by the letter from San Francisco, which is good enough to be published. What our padre is doing seems unbelievable. Blessed be God who gave him so much talent. I would like to have great talent so as to be able to give the Lord due thanks for the favors he grants us and for what he has done in giving our padre to us for a father.
3. I see from here, my daughter, the trial and loneliness you are all going through. Please God, the illness of Mother Subprioress will not be serious; I would be sorry even on account of the increased burden it would be for you. I was most happy that you benefited from the bloodletting. If that doctor has understood you, I wouldn't want any other to be taking care of you.
4. Today they brought me the enclosed letter from the prioress of Malagón. For some time now she has not got worse. Everything I can do for her health and happiness, I do. For apart from all that I owe her, her health is very important to me. But yours is much more so, believe me without a doubt. You can imagine from this how much I want you to be well!
5. From the enclosed note you will see that Mariano received your letter. I've already written you about the one he refers to from my brother, for I think I tore that one up with some other letters. It was still open, and that must be what happened. I was very upset and made a great effort to find it, for it was a wonderful letter. Now he has written me to tell me he has sent you a letter with the muleteer from Avila. Thus, I'll say nothing about him except that his soul is making good progress in prayer and that he gives away a great deal in alms. Pray always for him and for me as well, and remain with God, my daughter.
6. I was much more upset to learn that the prior there is not carrying out his office well than about his pusillanimity. Our padre ought also to frighten him by pointing out what is wrong with him, which he will do, as is his custom. My regards to all, and to Fray Gregorio",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,8,0,10,22,4,0,1,8,4,9,7,8,2,2,0,0,5,0,0
"577",1576,104,"especially, and to Nicolao if he hasn't left, and to those daughters of mine. My greetings to Gabriela for her letters and to the subprioress. Oh if I could give you some of the extra nuns from up here! But God will provide them for you. I've already asked about the fleet. I well understand the burden that you have there, for I am worried about it, but I hope that God will take care of everything and that your health will last. May His Majesty watch over you and make you very holy, amen.
7. I am delighted that you are beginning to recognize what you have there in our padre. I was aware of this already in Beas. Some letters from down there and from Caravaca arrived today. I am enclosing the one from Caravaca so that our padre may read it, and you also. Return it to me with this same muleteer, for I need it because of what it says about the dowries. In the letter written to the prioress she complains much about you.
8. Now I must send to Caravaca a statue of Our Lady that I got for them. It's large and beautiful, and not yet attired. And they are making one of St. Joseph for me that won't cost the nuns anything. You are carrying out your office very well, and you did more than very well to inform me about the pinching, the pathetic customs left over from the Incarnation.
Today is -- I've already told you.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
9. Our padre answered me very well about everything and sent the official permissions I asked for. Kiss his hands for me. 1. Jesus be with your paternity, mi padre. Oh, what a good day I had today, for Padre Mariano has sent me all your letters! There's no need for you to tell him to do so, for he does it in response to my request. And even though they arrive late, they are a great consolation to me. But still you do me a great charity when you write telling me the substance of what is going on; for as I say those other letters arrive late, although when he receives one for me, he sends it on at once. We are very good friends.
2. I was moved to praise the Lord for the manner and grace and, above all, perfection with which you write. Oh, mi padre, what majesty lies in your words when you write about perfection and what consolation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,2,10,0,5,19,1,1,1,5,4,7,8,7,2,2,1,1,1,1,0
"578",1576,105,"they bring to my soul! Even if we were not faithful to God for the good that comes from this, but were so only on account of the authority he confers on others (and the greater the authority the more faithful), our gain would be most great. It seems clear that you are on good terms with His Majesty. May He be blessed for everything, for he grants me so many favors and gives you so much light and strength. I will never be able to serve him enough.
3. The letter you wrote me from Trigueros about Tostado was excellent, and you did well to tear up those that were delivered to you with requests. Well, mi padre, God is helping you and teaching you with all clarity, as they say. Have no fear of failing in your great undertaking. Oh, how I envy you and Padre Fray Antonio because of the sins you prevent, and here I am with only desires!
4. Let me know on what grounds the accusation was made against the nun who is a virgin and bearing a child. I think a charge like that is the greatest stupidity. But none could match the one you wrote me about the other day. Do you think it is a small favor the Lord grants you to be able to bear these things the way you do? I tell you he is repaying you for the services you are rendering him down there. This will not be your only reward.
5. I am frightened by all the adversity, especially about the Masses, for I went to the choir to ask God's help for those souls. It isn't possible that God would allow so much evil to increase, now that he has begun to reveal it. Every day I am learning more about the fruit of prayer and the value before God of a soul that for God's honor alone seeks help for others. Believe me, mi padre, I think the desire is being accomplished for which these monasteries were founded, which was to pray to God to help those who struggle for his honor and service, since we women count for nothing. When I consider the perfection of these nuns, I am not surprised by what they obtain from God.
6. I was delighted to see the letter that the prioress of Paterna wrote you and the skill God gives you in everything. I hope in God the nuns will do much good, and I felt a great",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,7,1,0,2,24,0,10,25,3,3,2,10,6,7,6,8,1,2,1,0,0,1,1
"579",1576,106,"desire that these foundations continue to be made. I've already written to you about one, concerning which the prioress in Medina writes in the enclosed letter. It's not 1,000 ducats that she is giving but 600. It could be, now, that the donor is keeping the rest. I discussed this matter with Doctor Velázquez because I had a scruple about dealing with it against the general's will. He insisted that I try to get Doña Luisa to write to the ambassador and ask him to obtain permission from the general. He offered to give the information that needed to be presented and said that if the general doesn't give it, permission should be sought from the pope, informing him that these houses are mirrors for Spain. This is what I am planning to do unless you think otherwise.
7. I answered requesting that they write me again about the way in which this money was given. I have already written to Maestro Ripalda, who is now rector in Burgos and a great friend of mine from the Society, that he inquire for me and let me know, and that I would send someone there, if fitting, to see the place and begin the negotiations. So, if it seems all right to you, Antonio Gaytán and Julián de Avila could go when the good weather comes. You can send them the authorization and they will be able to make the foundation as they did in Caravaca without my having to go. Even if more nuns are taken for the purpose of reforming other houses, there are enough to go around as long as the number in the houses is small, as is the case down there. In others, where the nuns are more numerous, I think more than two should go, and even down there I do not regret their letting a lay sister go, for they have them, and what truly fine ones!
8. I am certain that no remedy exists for monasteries of nuns if there is not someone behind the doors to watch over them. The Incarnation is now something to praise God for. Oh, what a desire I have to see all of the nuns free from the jurisdiction of the calced friars. I will dedicate my life to our being made a separate province, because all the harm comes from our not being separate, and there is no remedy. For although other monasteries are relaxed, they are not so to such an extreme. I mean those",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,4,2,9,0,3,10,0,0,1,9,8,14,9,5,3,1,0,0,3,0,0
"580",1576,107,"subject to the friars, for it's a terrible thing with those subject to the ordinaries. And if superiors realized what their responsibilities are and took the care that you do, matters would go otherwise. And it would be no small mercy from God that there be so many prayers offered by good souls for his church.
9. I think what you say about the habits is very good, and one year from now you can give them to all the nuns. Once it's done, it's done, for all the clamor lasts for only a few days. And if some are punished the others will remain silent, for women on the whole are timid. Those novices should not remain there, for goodness' sake, for they would have such a bad beginning. It's very important that we have success with this monastery, for it is the first. I tell you that if you think they are your friends they are repaying you with their deeds.
10. I approve of the severity used by our Padre Fray Antonio. Understand, then, that with some it would not be harmful to so act, and this is very important, for I know them. Perhaps more than one sin of the tongue will be avoided and they will even become more submissive. Gentleness must be accompanied by severity -- this is the way God leads us -- and for those very determined individuals there is no other remedy. And I repeat that those poor discalced nuns are very much alone, for if one of them gets sick it will be a severe trial. God will give them health since he sees the need.
11. All your daughters here are doing well, except for those in Beas who are being killed by lawsuits. But it is no serious thing that they suffer something, since the foundation was made without much trouble. I will never have better days than those I had there with my Paul. I was pleased that he wrote me as ""your dear son""; and how quickly I said (being alone), ""He is right!"" I was delighted to hear it, and I would be even more delighted if matters down there proceeded so well that he could return to care for matters up here which I hope will be entrusted to his care.
12. I am distressed over the sickness of the prioress there, for it would be hard to find another one like her for that post. Make sure she gets good care and that she takes",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,11,1,16,24,3,2,3,8,8,16,10,6,1,4,1,1,3,0,0
"581",1576,108,"something for that continual fever. Oh, how well I get on with my confessor! To make me do some penance he obliges me to eat more every day than I usually do and to pamper myself.
13. My Isabel is here. She asks how you can joke with her so much as not to answer her. I gave her a little melon; and she told me it was very cold, that it deafens her throat. I tell you she uses the most delightful expressions, and she's always happy, with a gentle disposition that reminds me very much of mi padre. May God watch over him much more than me, amen, amen.
Your Reverence's daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
14. You should know that the nuns down there have a strange fear of the prioress, and also the custom of never saying anything precise to their superiors. The students who serve them must be watched. May God keep you. For Mother María de San José, Carmelite prioress.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. Until you write that your fever is gone, I will be worried about you. Be careful that it doesn't turn into jaundice, which can happen where there is anemia. Although there was hardly ever any occasion for me to contract this illness, I have suffered much from it. The cure consisted of some aromatic fumigations with vetch and coriander leaves and egg shells and a little oil and a little bit of rosemary and a little lavender, which I inhaled while lying in bed. I assure you that I recovered. This is only for you; I think it would be good if you tried it sometime. I once suffered from fevers for eight months, and with this remedy they went away.
2. I do not tire of thanking God that little Blase was there on the night the good old woman died. May the Lord take her to himself, as we have begged him here. I don't think there will be any need to console her sister or niece. Give them my regards and tell them they are right in being happy that she has gone to enjoy God. But Beatriz must not be desiring the same, for she should be careful that she doesn't commit a sin with such foolishness. You did me a great favor by writing such a detailed account of all this, and I rejoice that you have received so good an inheritance. It doesn't seem to me that the devil has afflicted",2,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,2,16,1,9,16,2,1,2,6,4,8,17,10,2,2,1,1,6,0,2
"582",1576,109,"you down there with the pusillanimity he did me, for now I see that it was he; up here I have returned to the way I felt before. What is this that the good prior of Las Cuevas is writing to Padre Mariano that he try to get a trickle of water for you? I don't know how he could succeed, although it would certainly make me very happy. He puts as much effort into the matter as he would if it were for himself. Blessed be God that he is in good health; I'm going to write to him.
3. Many regards to all the nuns, and to my Gabriela, for her letters are a delight to me. Let me know whether she is a good turn sister, and don't forget to give my greetings to Delgada, and tell me whether Fray Bartolomé de Aguilar is well. I don't know how you can be sick since you have our padre there. Each day God gives with both ... etc.
4. Peru is where my brother is, although by now I believe he has moved further on. I will find out from Lorenzo. But in regard to what you have to do down there, remember that he doesn't have an established residence, because he is not yet married, and he is in a place one day, and gone the next, as they say. I sent your letter to my brother, Lorenzo. If you have told him what country this man of whom you speak is from, perhaps he will know to whom you can recommend him. Try to find out about this and write to me when you do.
5. It would be only right to pay for the house with Beatriz's dowry, for she played a part, I believe, in our being sent down there. Always tell Gabriela to keep me informed on how things are going in Paterna so that you don't have to tire yourself. It's no surprise that they have little peace. Ask mi padre if it wouldn't be good for Margarita to go there and join them, for she would certainly have the courage. It seems to me they are very isolated, and I think she could make profession (although I don't remember when she received the habit). If one of the two sisters were to become sick it would be a rough situation, and you are not in want of lay sisters. May God be with you, amen.

6. From the enclosed letter you will see how the prioress of Malagón is doing; it is from her doctor.
7. Read the two other enclosed letters. So that you don't do what I am advising San Francisco, I'm sending them to you open; close them. If Father Prior gives you any pictures for me, don't take any of them for yourself; he will give you as many as you want down there. 1. ... I will be happy if she leaves it to him as she did the rest. Be careful how you speak to her about all this that I am writing to you, for she will tell her mother, and this will look bad after the letter I've written to Don Pedro. You can easily tell her that she should leave it to his conscience; otherwise I would not interfere in the matter, as is true.
2. I am amused that Doctor Velázquez thinks that Don Pedro should not take it upon his conscience, while as usual there will be someone to tell Don Pedro that he can do so. Those who think the Fathers of the Society are being moved by their own interests are so displeased that they have thought it good for him to act in this way. Don Pedro is more considerate of my reputation than you because he is delivering me from getting involved. May God pardon and watch over you for me and give you many happy years.
3. I am always concerned that you not displease Señora Doña María.
4. We are doing well. I sent your letter to Father Provincial in which you say that Doña María now wants her to renounce her possessions in favor of the house. I don't know what to say about this world, for where there is a question of self-interest there is no holiness, and this makes me want to abhor everything in it. I don't know why you are getting a Theatine mixed up in all this (for Catalina tells me that Mercado is one), since you know their own interests are at stake. Prádanos has pleased me very much; I believe he is a man of great perfection. May God give perfection to us also, and to them their money.

After all, since you have a superior, I believe it would be better for you not to renounce anything until you get his opinion. So don't pay attention to what I have said other than to draw light about what would be more fitting. I would not want to impose this on you, for you have enough trials. Write about it all to Padre Maestro, and through Arellano, the Dominican, you could let me know whether she is calm. Señora Doña María will have him come ... 1.

May God be blessed for everything. That there be matter for confession in these things or in the fact of your coming here seems to me to arise from a scruple rather than virtue. You displease me very much for this. But you have to have some fault, since, after all, you are a son of Adam.

May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter, and give you his intense love this Christmas so that you do not feel your illness so much.

You need not be disturbed about such matters, for in that bed you are gaining glory upon glory.
2. It is a good thing that you are not worse in such trying weather. Do not be surprised by your weakness, for you have been sick a long time. The cough must have come from some cold draft you may have been in, but without knowing for certain the cause, nothing can be prescribed for you here. It's better if the doctors there prescribe for you.

5. My greetings to ... and that I am letting her know that there is quite an uproar because Sister Casilda is renouncing her possessions. Don Pedro has written me about this. Doctor Velázquez, who is my confessor, says that they cannot make her go against her will. Well, I have left it to Don Pedro's conscience. I don't know where it will all end up. They want to give her 500 ducats and the cost of her veil -- what an expense that is, so great that it has to be mentioned! -- but they do not want to give it now. Surely, this angel owes but little to her mother. On account of the child's distress, which is great, I would like to see the whole matter concluded. And so I wrote to her asking her not to worry even if they don't give her anything.
6. Beatriz writes that she is better now and suffers no more. Since she sees you want her to be well, she thinks she is well even though she may be sick. I've never seen anything like it, as the poor licentiate says ... I am fine. May it please the Lord that you, my daughter, will be well very soon, amen.

4. The three foundresses will make their profession on New Year's Day, and it will be a consolation for them to have the statues there. 1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. The clock will soon strike two, and so I can't be long, I mean two o'clock in the night. For this reason I can't write to the good Nicolao; wish him a happy New Year. Today, his cousin's wife was here. That man who wants to found a monastery is always in the same frame of mind. He persists with his good desire, but since the business in Madrid that would allow it is not concluded and Padre Mariano is not coming here, things remain the same.
2. I am delighted that you have received such a good nun. Give my regards to her and to all the sisters. I was also delighted with the letters from my brother that you sent me. What makes me sorry is that you don't say anything about your health; may God grant you the health I desire for you. He does us a great favor by giving it to our padre. May he be forever blessed.
3. The muleteer brought me your letters for Malagón. I don't know if he brought the money. It would have been really foolish not to accept what my brother is giving you -- would that it had been more. It will be kind of you if you send me the sweets you mentioned if they are especially good, for I would like to have them for a particular need.

Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. This is a letter Señor Ahumada wrote me. I am sending it to you that you may see what he is here asking of you and not fail to do it in time. And, lest you forget because of your present grief, tell Señora Magdalena at once, so that she may take care of the matter. It would be a regrettable thing to rent the house when not needed, or to give it up when needed. Give her my best wishes, and tell her also to let me know how she is doing.
2. It seems to me that our Lord wanted to bring that little angel to be with her mother in heaven. May he be blessed for everything, for as I've been told, the poor little one was always sick. God has granted a great favor to us all, and to you especially by giving you so many people up there to help you bear the trials of this life. May it please His Majesty to watch over Doña Catalina, and may he always guide you by the hand, amen.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. My Isabel is getting better every day. When I go to recreation, which is not often, she sets aside her needlework and begins to sing:
Mother Foundress

Is coming to recreation;

Let's all dance and sing

And clap our hands in jubilation. 
2. But this is for a moment. Outside the time of recreation she remains in her hermitage so absorbed with the Infant Jesus, the shepherds, her work, and her thoughts (which she tells me about) that it is something to praise the Lord for. She sends her regards, and prays for you. And she desires to see you, but not Señora Juana or anyone, for she says they are of the world. She is for me a delight, but all this writing leaves me little time to enjoy it ... 
To the very illustrious Doña Luisa de la Cerda, my lady.
1. May Jesus be with your ladyship. I have neither time nor",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,2,3,18,1,3,15,0,0,3,4,4,10,15,7,5,1,2,2,2,0,0
"590",1576,117,"energy to write much, for, by myself, I am now writing to only a few persons. I wrote to you a short while ago. I am in a wretched state. When I am with you and in your city my health is better; although the people here do not abhor me, glory to God. But since my desire is to be there, so the body would want to be there also.
2. What do you think about how the Lord arranges things so that I can be at rest? May his name be blessed, for he has wished to work things out through persons who are such servants of God that I think His Majesty will be greatly served through this. For the love of His Majesty you might try to obtain the license. I don't think the administrator should be told that it's for me, but that it is for a house of discalced nuns. And he should be told of the great good they do wherever they are. At least this is true for our nuns in Malagón, glory to God. And you will see that soon you will have this servant of God there with you, for it seems that the Lord does not want us to be separated. May it please His Majesty that we may be together in glory, with all my lords, of whom I ask for prayers. Write and tell me how your health is, for you have been very negligent in doing me this favor. The sisters here kiss your ladyship's hands.
3. You can't imagine how many indulgences and benefits we have obtained through the foundresses of this order. These favors are without number. May the Lord be with you.
Today is the feast of St. Lucy.
Your ladyship's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. I am happy that Padre Fray Antonio is not with you, for according to what they tell me, when he sees so many letters of mine and none for him, he becomes disturbed. O Jesus, what a wonderful thing it is for two souls to understand each other, for they neither lack something to say, nor grow tired. 1. Jesus be with your honor. Serna allows me so little time that I did not want to go on at length, but when I begin writing to you -- and since Serna comes so seldom -- I need time.
2. Do not read the letters I write to Francisco, for I fear that he is somewhat melancholic and is doing",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,0,16,0,4,18,2,0,1,7,6,10,8,2,2,1,1,2,4,2,0
"591",1576,118,"a lot by being open with me. Perhaps God gives him those scruples to detach him from other things. Fortunately, for his good, he is able to believe me.
3. Clearly, I didn't send the paper, although I was wrong in not telling you. I gave it to a sister to copy, and I have not been able to find it. Until they send another copy from Seville, there is no way I can send it to you.
4. I think by now they will have given you a letter I sent by way of Madrid, but in case it has been lost I will have to repeat what I said there. I regret having to spend time doing so. First, look over that house you have rented belonging to Hernán Alvarez de Peralta. I think I have heard it mentioned that in one of the rooms the walls are ready to cave in. Be very careful.
5. Second, send the small chest and any other of my papers that may have been in the bundles, for it seems to me there was a bag containing papers. Have them sent to me well sewn. If Doña Quiteria through Serna sends a parcel that she needs to send, they will easily fit inside. Add my seal also, for I can't bear using this seal with the skull. I prefer the one with the monogram of him whom I would like to have engraved on my heart as had St. Ignatius. Don't let anyone open the chest, unless it's yourself, for I think the writing on prayer is in there, and don't tell anyone what you find in it. Be on guard, for I don't give you permission to do this, nor would it be fitting. Even though it may seem to you that this would render service to God, I forbid it because of other disadvantages that would result. Enough said, for were I to learn that you tell someone, I would never let you read anything again.
6. The nuncio has asked me to send him copies of the patent letters authorizing me to found these houses, and an account of how many there are, and where, and how many nuns, and from where, their age, and how many I think have the qualities for being prioress. The lists of these things are in the chest, or maybe in the bag. Well, I need everything that is there. They say he wants it so as to set up the province. I fear,",10,0,5,1,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,4,3,4,0,6,7,1,0,3,12,6,11,14,3,1,4,0,5,0,0,0
"592",1576,119,"instead, that he may want our nuns to reform other monasteries, for he has spoken of this previously, and such a thing would not be good for us, except for monasteries of our order. Tell this to the subprioress, and tell her to send me the names of those who are in that house, the ages of those who are there now, and how long they have been nuns. This should be done with good handwriting in a small notebook, and signed with her name.
7. Now it occurs to me that I am prioress there and that I can do it, and so it is not necessary that she sign it but only send me the information, even if in her handwriting, for I can copy it. There is no reason for the nuns to know about this. You take care of how this is to be sent so that the papers aren't in danger of getting wet, and send the key.
8. That which I said is in the book is in the one where I treat of the Paternoster. There you will find much about the prayer you are experiencing, although not to the extent in which it is explained in the other book. It seems to me it is found in the section on Adveniat regnum tuum. Read it again, at least the part on the Paternoster. Perhaps you will find something that satisfies you.
9. Before I forget, how could you make a vow without telling me? That's a nice kind of obedience! This troubled me, although your determination pleased me. But what you did seemed to be dangerous. Inquire about this, for that which is a venial sin could become a mortal sin on account of the promise. I will also ask my confessor who is a most learned man. And it seems to me foolish, for what I promised carried with it certain conditions. I would not dare promise what you did, for I know that even the apostles committed venial sins. Only our Lady was free from them. I am sure that God accepted your intention, but it would seem to me wise for you to have the vow commuted at once for something else. If it can be done by means of a bull, do so immediately. This jubilee year would be a good occasion for doing so. God deliver us from committing ourselves to something in which it is so easy to fail without our hardly even being aware of it.",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4,1,2,12,1,8,18,0,2,1,20,7,10,13,5,0,2,1,0,0,0,0
"593",1576,120,"If God hasn't charged you with a greater fault, it is because he knows our nature well. In my opinion you should correct this situation at once, and don't make any more vows, for it's a dangerous thing. It doesn't seem to me to be inappropriate to speak at times about your prayer with your confessors, for, after all, they are close at hand and they can give you better counsel about everything, and nothing would be lost.
10. Your being sorry that you have bought La Serna is the work of the devil who doesn't want you to be grateful to God for the favor he granted you in this regard, which was great. Be convinced that it is the best you could do from many viewpoints, and you are providing your children with something more than property, which is honor. Nobody hears about your purchase without thinking that you were most fortunate. And do you think there is no work in collecting rent? You would be spending all your time in property seizures. Consider this a temptation; don't pay any heed to it, but praise God for what you bought, and don't think that if you had more time your prayer would go better. Make no mistake about this, for time well spent, like looking after your children's property, does not hurt prayer. God often gives more in a short moment than in a long time. His works are not measured by time.
11. Try, then, after these feast days are over to devote some time to getting all the records in suitable order. And what you spend on La Serna will be well spent, and when summer comes you will be happy to go and spend some days there. Jacob did not become less a saint for tending his flock, nor Abraham, nor St. Joachim. When we try to avoid work, everything tires us. That's the way it goes for me, and for this reason God wills that I be always loaded down with many things to do. Discuss all these things with Francisco de Salcedo, for in these temporal matters I willingly let him stand in my stead.
12. It is a great favor from God that you tire of what others find restful, but not for this reason should you renounce it. We have to serve God as he wishes and not as we wish. The livestock business is what in my opinion you can disregard. For this reason I am somewhat happy that you have",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,1,11,14,0,8,18,1,1,2,12,6,12,14,8,1,2,1,1,3,0,0
"594",1576,121,"given up the business with Antonio Ruiz that was based on profit. For even in the eyes of the world one suffers some little loss through such dealings. I think it would be better for you to be moderate in almsgiving, for God has given you food and what you need to give alms, but not a lot. I do not call what you want to do at La Serna the livestock business, for it is something very good; it is not what I call a business. I've already told you that in all these matters you should follow the opinion of Francisco de Salcedo, and you will no longer have such ideas. And always give my best regards to him and anyone else you choose, and to Pedro de Ahumada to whom I would like to have time to write so that he might answer, for his letters are a delight to me.
13. Tell Teresa not to fear that I love anyone as much as I do her and that she should distribute the holy pictures, except those I put aside for myself, and that she give some to her brothers. I long to see her. I was moved by what you wrote about her to Seville. They sent me your letters, which filled the sisters with joy when I read them in recreation, and me too. Whoever would take away gallantry from my brother would be taking away his life. Everything seems to him good, since his gallantry is put into practice for saints, for I believe these nuns are saints. In every instance they put me to shame.
14. We had a great feast yesterday for the Holy Name of Jesus; may God reward you. I don't know what to send you for all you do for me except these carols I composed, for my confessor gave me orders to bring some happiness to the sisters. I spent the past evenings with them, and I didn't know how to bring them joy except with these. They have a delightful sound -- it would be nice if Francisquito could sing them. See if I'm not making good progress! Nonetheless, the Lord has granted me many favors during these days.
15. I am amazed by those he is granting you. May he be blessed forever. I understand why devotion is desired, which is good. It is one thing to desire it and another to ask for it.

16. It wouldn't be bad when at times you wake up with those impulses of love of God to sit up in bed for a while; always being careful though that you get the sleep your head needs (for unawares you could end up incapable of prayer). And be careful and try not to suffer much cold, for the cold is not good for the pains in your side. I don't know why you want those terrors and fears, for God is leading you by love. They were necessary back then. Don't think it is always the devil who impedes prayer, for God in his mercy sometimes takes it away. And I am inclined to say that this is almost as great a favor as when he bestows much prayer; and this for many reasons that I do not have time to tell you now. The prayer God gives you is incomparably greater than thinking about hell, and you wouldn't be able to do so even if you desired. And don't desire to do so, for there is no reason for it.
17. Some of the responses of the sisters made me laugh. Others were excellent, for they gave me light on the subject, for don't think that I know the meaning. I didn't do any more than mention to you haphazardly what I will speak to you about the next time I see you, God willing.
18. I was amused by good Francisco de Salcedo's response. His humility is in a sense strange. God so leads him with fear that it could even seem to him wrong to speak of these matters in this way. We have to accommodate ourselves to what we see in souls. I tell you he is a holy man, but God is not leading him along the road he is leading you. Indeed, he is leading him as he does the strong, and us as he does the weak. The response was long for someone of Francisco's temperament.
19. I just now read your letter again. I hadn't understood that you wanted to get up during the night, as you say, but thought you just wanted to sit up in the bed. I thought that was already a lot, for it is important not to go without",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,2,0,17,0,11,15,3,1,1,17,12,11,8,6,2,4,3,4,2,2,0

20. Your letters do not tire me, for they console me greatly, and I would be consoled if I were able to write more frequently. But I have so much correspondence that I cannot write more often, and even tonight my prayer has been impeded by this work. This doesn't cause me any scruple, only regret at not having time. God gives it to us that we might always spend it in his service, amen.
21. Different kinds of fish in this town are so scarce that it is a pity for the sisters, and so I was delighted with those sea bream. I think considering the weather they could have been sent without bread. If you manage to have some when Serna comes, or some fresh sardines, give the subprioress the means for sending them, for her package was very well wrapped. This is a terrible place for having to go without eating meat, for there is never even a fresh egg around. Nonetheless, I was thinking today that I haven't felt so well in years, and I am keeping all the observance that the other nuns do, which is a great consolation for me.
22. The enclosed verses that are not in my handwriting are not my work, but they seem to me good for Francisco. In the way the nuns at St. Joseph's compose theirs, one of the sisters here did these. During these Christmas festivities we did a lot of this in recreation. Today is the second day of the year.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
23. I thought that you would send us your carol, for these have neither rhyme nor reason to them, and the sisters sing everything. I now recall one that I once composed while in deep prayer, and it seemed I entered into even greater quiet. Here it is, but I don't remember if the verses went just like this. See how even from here I want to provide you with some recreation.
 

Oh Beauty exceeding
All other beauties!

God forgive you for making me waste time, but I think these stanzas will touch you and inspire you with devotion, but don't tell anyone. Doña Guiomar and I were together at that time. Give her my regards. 1. Jesus be with your reverence, my daughter. You must have experienced a happy Christmas since you have mi padre there, for I would too, and happy New Year. It seems that things down there are not going to end so quickly, and I am already feeling anguish over the loneliness his absence causes us up here. Oh what freezing cold we're having! It is not much different than in Avila. Nonetheless, I am well, although I am longing to receive a letter from down there because it seems a long time since I have received any. The mail is as slow in getting up to us as it is in getting down to you. Truly, everything seems slow to one with longings.
2. From your note at the top of your letter I see that you are feeling better since you have been bled; what I want to know is whether the fever has gone away. I was happy to receive your letter and would be much happier to see you. I would be particularly happy now, for I feel that we are very close friends, for there are few others with whom I would enjoy speaking about any number of things. You certainly please me, and so I rejoice to see from your letters that you have come to understand, and that if it pleases God we see each other again you wouldn't be foolish, for you have come to know how I love you, and so I feel much tender compassion for you in your illness.
3. As for the illness of Mother Prioress of Malagón, no one understands it. They say she is somewhat better, but the high fever doesn't go away, nor can she get up. I so much wish she could get well enough to be brought here. Don't fail to pray much for her. Since I know I don't have to insist on this with you, I don't repeat it every time.

5. I am writing to mi padre that it is very important, since they need nuns at Paterna -- I mean lay sisters -- that he send some of ours, for these would be a help to the other nuns who I assure you are few in number. Send them my regards, and always let me know how they are doing. Fray Ambrosio told me how good our padre's health is. I felt very grateful to you, for I think a major part of this is due to your care for him. Blessed be God who grants us so many favors. Many regards to Padre Fray Antonio. Since he never answers me, I don't write to him. Insofar as possible try not to let him know about all the letters I write; tell mi padre not to say anything to him about them. My regards to Garciálvarez and anyone else you happen to see. It has just occurred to me to ask what you did for early Christmas morning. Let me know, and remain with God. May His Majesty make you a saint, as I beg of him.
It is the third day of January.
6. My brother wrote me yesterday. The freezing cold isn't doing him any harm. The favors he is receiving in prayer are something to praise God for. He attributes them to the prayers of the discalced nuns. He is making much progress and doing good for all of us. Do not forget him.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
Turn the page.
7. I gave the paper from our padre, the one he wrote to Garciálvarez, to a sister to copy, for it is excellent for every house and for Avila. It seems the devil made it disappear. Anyway, send me another like it in good script, and don't forget. 1. These inner spiritual experiences are difficult to speak about, and still more so when one wants to speak of them intelligibly. If this writing were not done under obedience, one would be lucky to succeed especially in matters so hard to explain. But such success makes little difference since these words are destined for one who knows other more foolish things about me.
I beg your Reverence to realize that in all things I say it is",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,0,16,0,5,21,0,0,0,12,11,6,11,8,1,4,4,0,2,0,0
"599",1576,126,"not my intention to think I am stating them correctly, for I could be mistaken. But what I can certify is that I shall not mention anything I have not sometimes, or many times, experienced. Whether what I say is correct or incorrect, your Reverence may discern and inform me.
2. It seems to me it would be pleasing to your Reverence if from the beginning I started to deal with supernatural experiences, for there is already understanding of the devotion, tenderness, tears, and meditations we can ourselves, with the help of the Lord, procure here below.
3. The first prayer I experienced that in my opinion was supernatural (a term I use for what cannot be acquired by effort or diligence, however much one tries, although one can dispose oneself for it which would help a great deal) is an interior recollection felt in the soul. For it appears that just as the soul has exterior senses it also has other interior senses through which it seems to want to withdraw within, away from the outside noise. So, sometimes this recollection draws these exterior senses after itself, for it gives the soul the desire to close its eyes and not hear or see or understand anything other than that in which it is then occupied, which is communion with God in solitude. In this state none of the senses or faculties are lost, for all are left intact. But they are left that way so that the soul may be occupied in God. And this explanation will be easy to understand for anyone to whom the Lord has granted this prayer; and for those to whom He has not, there will be need at least for many words and comparisons.
4. A very pleasing interior quiet and peace sometimes flow from this recollection, so that it doesn't seem to the soul it is lacking anything. Even speaking tires it, I mean reciting vocal prayer and meditating. All it wants is to love. This quiet lasts a short while, and even a longer while.
5. From this prayer there usually proceeds what is called a sleep of the faculties, for they are neither absorbed nor so suspended that the prayer can be called a rapture. Although this prayer is not complete union, the soul sometimes, and even often, understands that the will alone is united, and this is known very clearly; I mean it is clear in the soul's opinion. The will is completely occupied in God, and it sees it lacks",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,19,0,4,8,0,0,3,22,2,11,25,8,3,6,1,2,2,1,0
"600",1576,127,"the power to be engaged in any other work. The other two faculties are free for business and works of service of God. In sum, Martha and Mary walk together. I asked Father Francis if this experience could be deceiving because it puzzled me, and he told me that the experience is a frequent one.
6. When there is union of all the faculties, things are very different because none of them is able to function. The intellect is as though in awe; the will loves more than it understands, but it doesn't understand in a describable way whether it loves or what it does; there is no memory at all, in my opinion, nor thought; nor even during that time are the senses awake, but they are as though lost, that the soul might be more occupied in what it enjoys. This union passes quickly. By the wealth of humility and other virtues and desires left in the soul, one discerns the great good that comes to one through that favor. But what the union is cannot be described, for even though the soul is given understanding, it doesn't know how it understands or how to describe it. In my opinion, if this experience is authentic, it is the greatest favor our Lord grants along this spiritual path, at least among the greatest.
7. Rapture and suspension, in my opinion, are both the same. But I am used to saying suspension in order to avoid saying rapture, a word that frightens. And indeed the union just described can also be called suspension. The difference between rapture and union is this: the rapture lasts longer and is felt more exteriorly, for your breathing diminishes in such a way that you are unable to speak or open your eyes. Although this diminishing of these bodily powers occurs in union, it takes place in this prayer with greater force, because the natural heat leaves the body, going I don't know where. When the rapture is intense (for in all these kinds of prayer there is a more and a less), when it is greater, as I say, the hands are frozen and sometimes stretched out like sticks, and the body remains as it is, either standing or kneeling. And the soul is so occupied with rejoicing in what the Lord represents to it that it seemingly forgets to animate the body and leaves the body abandoned; and if the suspension lasts, the nerves are left aching.
8. It seems to me the Lord",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,3,11,0,5,13,2,0,3,13,7,5,16,4,1,4,3,10,1,2,0
"601",1576,128,"here wants the soul to understand more of what it enjoys in the union. So some things about His Majesty are usually revealed to it in the rapture. And the effects left in the soul are great, and there is a forgetfulness of self in the desire that so tremendous a Lord and God be known and praised. In my opinion, if the suspension is from God the soul cannot remain without a deep awareness of its inability to do anything there and of its great misery and ingratitude for not having served Him who solely out of His goodness grants it such a wonderful favor. For the feeling and sweetness are so excessive that if the remembrance of them didn't pass away, all the comparable satisfactions here on earth would ever be nauseating to the soul. As a result, it comes to have little esteem for all the things of the world.
9. The difference between rapture and transport is that in rapture the soul only gradually dies to these exterior things and loses its senses and lives to God. The transport comes swiftly through some knowledge the Lord gives in the soul's intimate depths that makes it seem to the soul that its higher part is being carried away; for in its opinion this higher part leaves the body. So courage is necessary in the beginning for the soul to surrender itself into the arms of the Lord to go wherever He may want to bring it. Because until His Majesty places it in peace where He desires to bring it (I say ""bring it"" by which is understood to lofty things), there is certainly need to be determined to die for Him. For the poor soul doesn't know what that experience is, I mean at the beginning.
10. The virtues, in my opinion, are left much stronger from this experience, for the soul desires and devotes itself more entirely to understanding the power of this great God in order to fear and love Him. Without our being able to resist, He carries the soul away; indeed, as its Lord. It is left with deep repentance for having offended Him, and fright at how it dared to offend such great Majesty, and intense longing that no one offend Him but that all praise Him. I think those extraordinary desires for the salvation of souls, and for taking part in this work, and that God might be praised as He deserves must come from this experience.
11. The flight of",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,24,2,8,21,3,3,3,16,5,11,12,9,0,1,1,2,1,1,0
"602",1576,129,"the spirit is something I don't know what to call that rises up from the most intimate part of the soul. I only remember the following comparison, which I put down in that place your Reverence knows of where these kinds of prayer and others are explained at length; and my memory is such that I quickly forget. I think the soul and the spirit must be one, but that like a fire that is great and has been getting ready to start blazing, so the soul, through the readiness it has from God does suddenly begin to blaze and shoot forth a flame reaching high in the air, even though the flame is just as much fire as that which remains beneath. This flame doesn't cease to be fire just because it rises up. So here in the soul it seems something is produced so suddenly and delicately that it rises up to the superior part and goes wherever the Lord wills. This cannot be explained any further. It seems to be a flight, for I don't know what else to compare it to. I know it is recognized very clearly and that it cannot be stopped.
12. It seems that that little bird, the spirit, escapes from the misery of the flesh and the prison of this body, and thus it can be more occupied in what the Lord gives it. What He gives is something so delicate and so precious, from what the soul understands, that there doesn't seem to be any illusion in it or in any of these things when they take place. Afterward there were fears, since the one who received this favor was so wretched that everything seemed to give reason for fearing; although in the interior of the soul there remains a certitude and security that enables one to live, but not to set aside any efforts against being deceived.
13. An impulse is what I call a desire that sometimes comes upon the soul, and even very habitually, without any preceding prayer. But suddenly there comes to it a remembrance of its separation from God, or of some word it hears that refers to this separation. This remembrance is so powerful and has such force sometimes that in an instant the soul seems to be beside itself. It's as though you were suddenly given some unknown and very painful news, or like a great and sudden shock that takes away the mind's discursive power to console itself; the mind remains as",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,17,0,5,12,3,0,1,21,6,2,23,3,0,1,3,2,1,0,0
"603",1576,130,"if absorbed. So it is here, except that the pain serves such a purpose that the soul comes to know that the purpose is worth dying for.
14. The fact is that it seems everything the soul understands then adds to its pain, and that the Lord doesn't want it to profit in its entire being from anything else. Nor does its will appear to be alive, but it seems to be in so great a solitude and so forsaken by all that this abandonment cannot be described in writing. For the whole world and its affairs give it pain, and no created thing provides it with company, nor does it want any company but only the Creator; and it sees that having such company is impossible unless it dies. Since it must not kill itself, it so dies with the longing to die that there is true danger of death; and it finds itself as though hanging between heaven and earth. It doesn't know what to do with itself. And from time to time God gives it a knowledge of Himself in a strange and indescribable way so that it might see what it is missing. There is no knowledge on earth, at least of what I have received, equal to this divine knowledge. In the half hour this prayer lasts, there is sufficient time to leave the body so disjoined and the arms so straight that the hands can't even write; and the pains are most severe.
15. Nothing of this is felt until that impulse passes. The soul has enough to do in experiencing what is happening interiorly. Nor do I believe it would feel heavy bodily torments. Yet it is in possession of its senses, and it can speak and even see -- but not walk because the forceful blow of love prostrates it. But unless God gives this impulse nothing is gained even were one to die for it. It leaves the greatest effect and improvement in the soul. Some learned men explain it one way, others another way; none of them condemns it. The Master Avila wrote me that it was good, and so says everyone. The soul understands clearly that this impulse is a great favor of the Lord. Were it very frequent one's life would not last long.
16. In the ordinary impulse there comes this extremely tender desire to serve God, along with tearful wishes to leave this exile. But since there is freedom for the soul to consider that it is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,2,14,8,11,13,0,2,3,18,8,9,9,8,3,2,4,4,7,1,0
"604",1576,131,"the Lord's will that it go on living, it is consoled by this thought and offers Him its own life, begging Him that it be for no purpose other than His glory. With this thought the soul can continue on.
17. Another type of prayer quite frequent is a kind of wound in which it seems as though an arrow is thrust into the heart, or into the soul itself. Thus the wound causes a severe pain which makes the soul moan; yet, the pain is so delightful the soul would never want it to go away. This pain is not in the senses, nor is the sore a physical one; but the pain lies in the interior depths of the soul without resemblance to bodily pain. Yet, since the experience cannot be explained save through comparisons, these rough comparisons are used (I mean rough when compared to what the experience is); but I don't know how to describe it any other way. For this reason these are not things to be written about or spoken of, because it's impossible to understand them unless one has experienced them. I mention the interior depths this pain reaches, because spiritual sufferings are extremely different from physical ones. From this fact I deduce how much greater the sufferings of souls in hell and purgatory are than what can be understood of them from bodily sufferings here on earth.
18. At other times, it seems this wound of love rises out of the intimate depths of the soul. Its effects are great. And when the Lord does not provide a remedy, there is none, no matter how much the soul strives to procure one. Nor can the soul resist when the Lord is pleased to provide a remedy. These wounds are like some longings for God, indescribably alive and refined. Since the soul sees it is bound in such a way that it cannot enjoy God as it would like, a great abhorrence for the body comes over it. The body seems like a thick wall impeding the enjoyment of what the soul, in its opinion, knows it possesses within itself at that time without the hindrance of its body. Then it sees the great evil that came upon us through the sin of Adam when this freedom was lost.
19. This prayer was experienced before the raptures and great impulses I mentioned. I forgot to say that those great impulses are almost never taken away unless by a rapture and great favor from the",3,4,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,22,1,13,18,0,3,2,15,15,4,10,4,2,2,3,6,16,1,0
"605",1576,132,"Lord, in which He comforts the soul and encourages it to live for Him.
20. Because of some reasons, which would take a long time to list, none of what has been said can be mere fancy. Whether this wound is good or not the Lord knows. One cannot fail, in my honest opinion, to recognize the effects and the improvement it brings to the soul.
21. I see clearly that the Persons of the Trinity are distinct, as I saw yesterday when your Reverence was speaking with the provincial; except I do not see or hear anything, as I already mentioned to you. But there is a strange certitude even though the eyes of the soul do not see. And when that presence is gone, the soul is aware that it is gone. The how of this presence I do not know; but I do know very well that the experience is not imagined. For even though afterward I may try vehemently to represent it again, I cannot; and thus it is with everything written down here insofar as I can understand. For since so many years have gone by, one must have been able to see in order to speak of these things with this certitude.
22. It is true, and your Reverence should take note of this, that I can easily affirm who I think is the Person who always speaks; of the other Persons, I wouldn't be able to affirm that they speak. One of them I know clearly has never done so. I have never understood the reason why, nor do I occupy myself any more in asking about what God wants. For it seems to me that then the devil would deceive me; and neither would I ask now, for I would be afraid of that.
23. The first Person, I think, spoke once; but since I do not recall this clearly now, nor what was said, I wouldn't dare affirm it. Everything is written down in the place your Reverence knows of and in a much more ample way than it is here, although I don't know if it is put in the same words. Although knowledge is given in a strange manner that these Persons are distinct, the soul understands there is only one God. I don't recall that it seemed to me our Lord spoke unless in His humanity, and as I already said I can affirm that this experience is not the work of imagination.
24. What your Reverence says about water, I",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,11,0,5,8,1,0,1,23,9,10,10,12,6,11,0,1,1,0,1
"606",1576,133,"don't know; nor have I ever known where the terrestrial paradise is. I have already said I cannot avoid knowing what the Lord gives me knowledge of; I understand because I cannot do otherwise. But I have never asked His Majesty to give me knowledge of anything, for then it would seem to me I had imagined it and that the devil would deceive me. And never, glory to God, did I have a curious desire to know things, nor do I care to know anything more. This was quite a trial to me that without having wanted to know, as I say, I understood; although I think it was a means the Lord made use of for my salvation since I saw I was so wretched. For good people don't have need of so much in order to serve His Majesty.
25. Another prayer I recall, which comes before the first kind I mentioned, is a presence of God that is not a vision of any kind. But it seems that when and each time (at least when there is no dryness) one wants to pray to God, even though it be vocal prayer, one finds Him.
May it please God to have mercy on me and that I not lose through my own fault so many favors. 1. I had begun to confess to a person in a city where I am at present. But after his having been very kind to me, ever since he accepted the guidance of my soul, he discontinued coming here. While I was in prayer one night thinking about my need for such a person, I understood that God had kept him from coming because it was fitting for me to discuss my soul with another person in this city.
To do so was a burden to me because I would have to deal with a person I didn't know. It could turn out that he wouldn't understand me and would disturb me, and I loved the first one who had been doing me this charity. Although, whenever I saw or heard this other person preach he brought me spiritual consolation. But it also seemed to me inappropriate because he had many duties. The Lord said to me: ""I shall bring it about that he listen to and understand you. Open your soul to him, for some help will come from your troubles."" This latter was said, I think, because I was then extremely weary of being separated from God. Then His Majesty",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,23,0,7,9,2,0,1,27,9,11,10,5,2,6,1,0,1,1,0
"607",1576,134,"also told me He was clearly aware of my trial, but that it couldn't be otherwise while I lived in this exile, that everything was for my greater good; and He consoled me very much.
So it has come about that this other person is happy to listen to me and finds the time and has understood me and given me great comfort. He is a very learned and holy man. 1. On the feast of the Presentation while praying to God very intensely for a person, it seemed to me it was still unbecoming the great sanctity I desired for this person that he have his freedom and an income. I considered his poor health and the abundant light he gave to souls, and I heard: ""He serves Me very much, but it is a great thing to follow me stripped of everything as I was on the cross. Tell him to trust in me."" He mentioned the latter because I had concluded that this person couldn't reach such perfection with his poor health. 1. Once while thinking of the distress it caused me to eat meat and not do penance, I understood that sometimes my distress was more a matter of self-love than a desire for penance. Epilogue
 
JHS
 
1. It has occurred to me to record here how the nuns of the first monastery that was founded, St. Joseph's in Avila, about which I wrote in another work and not in this book, transferred their obedience to the order after having first professed it to the bishop.
2. When the monastery was founded, Don Alvaro de Mendoza was bishop, the one who is now Bishop of Palencia. All the time that he was in Avila he was extremely helpful to the nuns. And with regard to our giving obedience to the bishop, I heard from our Lord that it would be expedient to give it to him. This was borne out afterward, for in all the disagreements with the order and in many other things that happened we clearly found great support in him. Never did he allow any priest to make a visitation nor did he do anything more in that monastery than what I asked him. This arrangement lasted seventeen years, a little more or less, for I don't remember, nor did I ever intend that this jurisdiction be changed.
3. When those years were over, the Bishop of Avila was transferred to the diocese of Palencia. At that time I was in the monastery of",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,3,19,0,3,13,2,0,0,11,12,5,5,10,0,3,0,0,2,0,1
"609",1577,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. Oh, how many blessings this old daughter of yours begged for you on reception of this letter that Padre Mariano sent me today, 9 January. On the vigil of the Epiphany I had received the letter that came with the commission for Caravaca, which it was my delight to be able to send on, within two days, with a very reliable messenger. Your letter, despite your effort to soften the news of your illness, distressed me greatly. Blessed be God for granting me the wonderful favor of restoring you to health. Then I wrote to those monasteries I could asking for prayers for you. I will have to write again to give them the good news, having no other way to inform them. What a blessing it was that this other letter arrived so quickly. Every day I feel a greater obligation to you for the care you take to bring me joy; so I hope that God will reward you.
2. I tell you I was most pleased that now, as though you had no other responsibilities, you are dedicating yourself to the confessional. It seems to me to be something supernaturally inspired. Nonetheless, we must not seek miracles from God, and it's necessary that you realize you are not made of iron, and that many in the Society have ruined themselves through overwork. For days I have been weeping over what you tell me about the perdition of those souls who entered religious life in order to serve God. It would benefit them greatly to be given good confessors. If in those monasteries to which the discalced nuns are sent you do not provide help of this kind, I fear for the fruitfulness of the effort. Oppressing them with exterior practices and not providing someone to help them interiorly would be like burdening them with a heavy trial. I had this problem at the Incarnation until the discalced friars came.
3. Since you want to do this work only to help souls, then do so by finding someone who can guide them, and give orders that if there is a monastery of friars nearby, none of them be allowed to go and disturb these souls. I think Millán is in Antequera; perhaps he would be good. At least his letters that you send me are truly refreshing. May the Lord be pleased to direct everything well.
4. Oh, how happy it makes me to see",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,22,0,7,22,3,0,2,9,6,10,10,5,1,0,3,0,3,0,1
"610",1577,2,"the perfect way in which you write to Esperanza. For when dealing with letters that will be shown around, it is good that they be written in this way, even for your own sake. And how absolutely right you are in what you say about the reform, that souls are not to be conquered like bodies by force of arms. May God keep you, for you make me very happy. For my prayers for you to be efficacious, I would want to be very good -- I mean so that my supplications might be heard. In my desires and purposes I never find that I am cowardly, glory be to God, except when it comes to Paul.
5. Oh, what delight Angela found in the sentiment he manifested on a page written after a letter he sent! She says she would like to kiss his hands repeatedly and wants to tell you to be at ease, for the matchmaker was so qualified and made the knot so tight that it will be taken away only when life ends. And after death the knot will be even tighter, for the foolish striving for perfection will not be so excessive and the remembrance of you will rather help her praise the Lord. Her former freedom in fact kept her at war. Now the submission in which she lives is far better and more pleasing to God, for she finds someone who helps her bring to the Lord souls who will praise him. And this is such a great consolation and joy that I share in it in large measure. May he be blessed forever.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter and subject,
Teresa of Jesus For Madre María de San José, prioress.
1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. Before I forget, how is it that you never tell me anything about Padre Fray Bartolomé de Aguilar, the Dominican? I tell you, we owe him a great deal, for all the things he said were bad about that other house we bought were the reason for our having left it. As often as I think of the kind of life you would have had to live there, I can't thank God enough. May he be praised in everything. Be convinced that Fray Bartolomé is very good and that for matters concerning religious life he has more experience than others. I wouldn't want you to forget to call for him at times. He is a very good friend and well informed, and a monastery has nothing to",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,17,2,3,29,0,1,0,8,7,9,7,9,0,4,3,3,3,1,0
"611",1577,3,"lose by having persons like him to speak with. Here is a letter I've written him; please send it on.
2. Before I forget, I liked the note you sent me about the alms that were received and your estimation of how much you have earned. Please God what you say is true, for I would be delighted. But you're a fox, and I fear you are using some ruse as you do in regard to your health in order to please me.
3. Our prioress in Malagón remains the same. I have repeatedly asked our padre if water from Loja brought this far would help, for we could send for it; remind him of this. Today I have sent him a letter through a priest who was going down there to see him only on business. I was delighted to have that opportunity and so I am not writing to him now. You do me a great favor by sending me his letters, but be assured that even if there are no letters from him, those from you are most welcome -- have no fears about that.
4. I have already sent your package to Doña Juana de Antisco. There hasn't been time yet for me to receive an answer. For persons like her, it doesn't matter even if you have to spend something from the monastery, especially since we are not in need the way we were in the beginning. For when there is need, you are more obligated to your daughters.
5. Oh, how vain you will become now that you are almost provincial. And how it amused me that you said with such indifference, ""Here are some carols from the nuns,"" when you were probably the one behind them. I don't think it would be bad for me to tell you -- since you say that nobody there tells you anything -- to be careful not to yield to vanity. At least it appears evident you don't want to say or do anything foolish. Please God your intention will always be to serve him, for there is nothing wrong in all this. I am laughing to myself to see how burdened I am with correspondence and yet spend time writing about trivia. I will easily pardon you for boasting of knowing how to guide the one with the gold ingots if you in fact succeed, for I have a strong desire to see you without worry. Yet my brother is advancing so much in virtue he would willingly",3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,3,5,0,11,22,3,0,1,4,9,13,14,6,3,5,0,0,1,0,1
"612",1577,4,"come to your aid in all your needs.
6. It's gracious of you not to want there to be any other like Teresa. But you should know, certainly, that if my Bela does not have the natural and supernatural grace of the other (for we have truly seen some of the things God was bringing about in her), she has more intelligence, talent, and gentleness, so that you can get her to do whatever you wish. It's extraordinary the talent this child has, for with some drab little shepherds and some little nuns and a statue of our Lady belonging to her, there isn't a feast in which she doesn't create something with these in her hermitage or at recreation, along with some verses for which she provides a lovely tune, all of which leave us amazed. I have only one problem: I don't know how to correct the way she holds her mouth, for she keeps it very tight and has a laugh that is extremely cold, and she always goes around laughing. Sometimes I make her open her mouth, at other times close it, and at other times tell her not to laugh. She says it's not her fault but her mouth's, and she's right. Whoever has seen the charm of Teresa, physical and otherwise, must notice the difference more -- and here they do -- although I do not manifest my own view; I'm only telling you this in secret. Don't say anything to anyone, but I would like you to know the trouble I'm going to in order that she correct the way she holds her mouth. I think that when she's older, it won't look so cold, and at least her words are not cold.
7. That is my picture of your girls so that you don't think I am lying when telling you how one is better than the other. I've done so that you may have a laugh. Have no fear that I will dispense you from all the work I give you in receiving and sending letters.
8. Most pleasing to me were the verses that arrived from down there. I sent the first ones to my brother and some of the others, for they were not all of equal merit. I think you could show them to the old saint, telling him that this is how you spend your recreation, always speaking the language of perfection, and it is right to provide some diversion for the one to whom you owe so",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,2,3,0,5,21,1,1,0,8,5,9,15,13,5,3,4,4,1,0,0
"613",1577,5,"much. All that charity of his amazes me.
9. You ought to know that some adversity is being prepared for Padre Garciálvarez, for they say that he is educating you in pride; tell him this. Now the nuns in Avila are anxious about what they will write you, for my brother told them you had sent him the letter so that they would respond. You should know that no one here wears, or has worn, worsted cloth except me, for even now with all the freezing cold, I have not been able to do otherwise -- I have a great fear of the pain in my kidneys. So much has been mentioned to me about what I'm doing that I have a scruple about it. And since our padre took away my old habit, which was made of coarse wool, I don't know what to do. May God pardon him. Nonetheless, I say that because of the heat down there you couldn't wear anything but underskirts of light material, but not the same for the habit. The other matters little. Until they bring me what my holy prior is sending me, I don't know what to write him about, because I cannot say that I received it. I must write him a letter that I can send with the muleteer.
10. O Jesus, how obliged I am to him for what he does for you. How we laughed over Gabriela's letter, and how we were filled with devotion on hearing of the diligence of our saints and also the mortification of good Garciálvarez. I pray earnestly for them. Give my regards to him and to all the nuns, for I would like to write to each one, so much do I love them. Certainly, I have an especially great love for each sister; I don't know why. My regards to the Portuguese nun's mother, and to Delgada. How come you never mention Bernarda López? Read the enclosed letter for Paterna, and if it doesn't sound right you can make your emendations as the superior of that house. You have an advantage over me in knowing what would be the appropriate thing to say. God reward you for what you do for them -- I mean this -- for it gives me much consolation. It's a pity I don't know how to end when I write. Please God you will not gain the habit of charming others, as our padre has. May God charm you and transport you into himself, amen,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,11,0,5,18,2,0,1,8,11,8,6,6,0,6,2,2,1,2,0
"614",1577,6,"amen.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
11. Open this letter to the prioress of Paterna and read it, for I sealed it by mistake. And read the one for the prior of Las Cuevas to whom I have written again -- although in such a hurry that I don't know what I said -- and seal it. 1. Jesus be with your reverence. Oh, how happy it made me to learn that you are well! May God be blessed forever, for in these past days I have been troubled about your health. Take care of yourself, for the love of God, for if you are well everything will work out all right. Indeed, when I see you sick or with some suffering, I understand how much I love you in the Lord.
2. Before I forget, don't in any way try to have Nicolao come up here -- that would be very unfortunate for the nuns in Seville -- until that widow has entered down there. The prioress has been writing me about how the devil is trying to block her entrance and how Nicolao is carefully dealing with this matter. Although she has a keen desire to enter, others are making her doubtful. You must realize how important this is to the nuns, since with her dowry they could pay off their debt on the house.
3. I am very delighted with the good archbishop God has given us here. I don't worry about that gossip of the friars; it will end up like their other calumnies: they have found a man who longs to undergo such things.
4. As soon as I received your letter, I sent the archdeacon his. I don't think he will do anything, and I would like us to stop bothering him. Since we now have an archbishop, I have thought we could perhaps get him to speak to the chapter since the matter has already become public.
5. If Tostado is being dealt with the way you say, don't be afraid that the friars will be an obstacle to it any more. I am delighted that you are going to see Señora Doña Luisa, for we owe her a great deal in every way. She wrote to me saying she thought you were going to come to see her. The archdeacon said he would try to get them to answer the letter promptly and that he would come to see me. I will take care of the matter, for during these past days I haven't been able",2,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,1,3,11,0,10,17,3,1,1,10,10,11,10,6,4,5,0,0,2,2,0
"615",1577,7,"to attend to business affairs.
6. I did not dare express myself so openly in previous letters. Now that you are well, I want you to know that I can't wait to take the matter out of the hands of those blessed friars to whom Padre Juan Díaz entrusted it, for Maestro Córdoba is a cousin of Padre Valdemoro, and the other is a friend of both the prior and the provincial, who believe everything that is told to them, which is not little. I truly believe that they were not, in their minds, deceptive, for they are both well-meaning men. But when it seems that one might be proceeding unjustly, one doesn't have much enthusiasm. From what we can figure out, our padre will now be in Granada. The prioress of Seville informed me that the archbishop has sent word asking him to return to Seville; I don't know any more.
7. Thank Nicolao for what he is doing for the nuns. And for goodness' sake let him be if God calls him to more important matters than those of the archbishop, for God will provide someone else, although I certainly regret any trouble this would cause the archbishop; and that is how it should be, for we owe him a great deal. For some days I have been certain that the Grand Inquisitor would be the archbishop here; this is fortunate for us, and even if in some things it seems he is not so ... 1. Jesus be with your honor. I already mentioned in the letter sent through the mail carrier from Alba that the sardines arrived in good condition and the sweets at a good time, although I would have preferred that you had kept the best for yourself. May God reward you. Now don't send me anything else, for when I want something I'll ask for it. Congratulations for having moved to our area. Nevertheless look over carefully the room I mentioned, for if repairs are not made it will be dangerous; it was in such a state that the danger was great. Anyway, be careful.
2. With respect to the secret in my regard, I don't mean that you should feel obliged under pain of sin, for I am very much opposed to that sort of thing and one can slip if not careful. It's enough that you know it would cause me distress. As for the promise, my confessor has told me that it was not valid, which made me very happy, for",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,8,0,7,25,1,2,1,14,5,14,16,4,1,0,2,1,1,0,0
"616",1577,8,"I was worried about it. I also told him about the obedience you promised to me, which seemed to me inopportune. He says that obedience is good, but that you shouldn't promise it to me or to anyone else. And so I don't want you to do so, and even without the promise I accept your wish only reluctantly. I do so for the sake of your consolation on the condition that you don't make a promise of it to anyone. I rejoiced that you feel that Fray John understands you, for he has experience. And even Francisco has a little, but not of what God is granting you. May he be blessed forever without end. With both of them you are now well cared for.
3. How good God is! It seems to me he wants to show his greatness by raising up miserable people, and with so many favors, for I don't know any who are more wretched than the two of us. You ought to know that for more than eight days I have been in such a state that were it to last I would not be able to attend to so many business matters. From the time before I last wrote you, I've begun to have raptures again, and this distresses me because they happen in public sometimes. One came upon me at Matins. Trying to resist them doesn't help, nor can they be disguised. I'm so terribly embarrassed that I want to hide I don't know where. I plead with God not to let this happen to me in public. Beg this of God for me, because there are many disadvantages to experiencing them, and it doesn't seem to me that the prayer is better. I've been going around these days as though I were partially drunk; at least I am well aware that the soul is in a good place. Since the faculties are not free, it is a difficult thing to have to attend to more than what the soul wishes.
4. Prior to this, for about eight days I often found it impossible even to have a good thought, but was left in extreme aridity. In a certain way this highly pleased me, for I had spent some other days before those like the ones I am having now, and it is a great pleasure to see so clearly the little that we can do of ourselves. May he be blessed who can do everything, amen. I have said a great",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,3,10,0,8,23,5,0,2,12,7,9,12,4,1,2,1,0,0,0,1
"617",1577,9,"deal. The rest is not meant to be written or even spoken. It's good that we praise the Lord, each for the other; at least you should do so for me, for I am incapable of giving him the thanks I owe him, and so I need much help.
5. As for what you told me you experienced, I don't know what to say, for it is certainly beyond what you can understand and the beginning of many blessings, if you do not lose them through your own fault. I have already passed through this kind of prayer, and the soul afterward usually finds rest, and sometimes undertakes some penances. Especially, if the impulse is very strong, it doesn't seem the soul can endure it without doing something for God. It is a touch of love that is given to the soul in which you will understand, if it goes on increasing, what you say you do not understand in the poem; for it is a great affliction and pain that comes without one's knowing how, and most delightful. And although, as a matter of fact, it is a wound caused by the love of God in the soul, one doesn't know where it comes from or how, or whether it is a wound or what it is, but it feels this delightful pain that makes it complain, and so it says:
 

Sin herir, dolor hacéis
y sin dolor deshacéis
el amor de las criaturas
6. For when the soul is truly touched by this love of God, the love it has for creatures is taken away without any pain, I mean in such a way that the soul is no longer attached to any love. This doesn't come about without this love of God, for whatever regards creatures, if we love them greatly, causes pain; and separation from them causes much more. As God takes hold of a soul, he gives it dominion over all creatures. And even if that presence and delight is taken away (which is what you are complaining of), as if nothing had been experienced in the bodily senses, to which God wanted to give some share in the soul's joy, God doesn't abandon it. Neither does he fail to leave it enriched with favors, as is seen by the effects afterward with the passing of time.
7. As for the lascivious feelings that you tell me about, don't pay any attention to them. For although I have never experienced this -- for God in his goodness has",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,21,0,12,24,0,0,3,15,7,9,20,5,1,4,4,1,6,7,0
"618",1577,10,"always delivered me from those passions -- I think it must happen because the delight of the soul is so great that it arouses these natural feelings. They will die away with the help of God if you pay no attention to them. Other people have spoken to me about this.
8. The shaking will also go away, for since it is something new the soul grows frightened, and it has reason to be frightened. As the experience repeats itself you will become more capable of receiving favors. Do all that you can to resist this shaking and any exterior thing so that none of this becomes a habit, for it is a hindrance more than a help.
9. As for the heat you say you feel, it has little importance; it could be somewhat harmful to one's health if excessive, but it will also perhaps go away as will the shaking. These things, in my opinion, have to do with one's physical constitution. Since you have a sanguine temperament, the intense movement of the spirit along with one's natural heat, which is gathered in the superior part and touches the heart, can give rise to this. But, as I say, the quality of the prayer isn't any greater on this account.
10. I think I've answered what you said about ""feeling afterward as though nothing happened."" I think it may be St. Augustine who says that the spirit of God passes without leaving a trace just as an arrow passes through the air without leaving one. Now I recall that I answered this question. A huge amount of mail has arrived since I received your letters, and I still have many letters to write so that I don't have much time for this one.
11. At other times the soul is left in such a condition that it cannot return to itself for many days, but it seems like the sun that cannot be seen although its rays can be felt. So the soul seems to have its seat far off somewhere, and it animates the body, not being in it, since one or other of its faculties is suspended.
12. You are doing very well with your style of meditation, glory to God; I mean when you don't have the prayer of quiet. I don't know if I have answered everything; I always reread your letters, which requires a bit of time, and now I haven't had time to reread your last one except in bits and pieces. You shouldn't make",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,12,1,6,9,5,0,0,20,7,6,18,5,1,6,5,3,2,2,0
"619",1577,11,"the effort to read over those you send me. I never reread mine. If some word is missing, put it in, and I will do the same here with yours. The meaning is at once clear, and it is a waste of time to reread them unnecessarily.
13. For those days when you are unable to be recollected during the time of prayer, or have a desire to do something for the Lord, I am sending you this hairshirt, for it is a great help in awakening love, provided that you don't wear it when fully dressed or when sleeping. You can wear it anywhere on the body and adjust it so that you feel discomfort.
14. I am fearful of doing this, for you are so sanguine that anything could alter your blood. But doing something for God (even a trifle like this) when one has this love brings about so much happiness that I wouldn't want us to neglect trying it. When winter is over, you will do some other little thing, for I am not forgetting you. Write to let me know how you are faring with this trinket. I tell you that whatever may be the punishment we desire to impose on ourselves, it does become a trinket when we remember what our Lord suffered. I am laughing to myself to think how you send me sweets, presents, and money, and I send you hairshirts.
15. Give my regards to Aranda. Tell him to throw some of these enclosed pastilles around your room or close to the brazier, for they are very healthy and pure, and were given to me by the discalced nuns, who don't use anything out of the ordinary. However mortified you want to be, you can use them. They are excellent for rheumatism and headaches. Would you have this little package delivered to Doña María de Cepeda at the Incarnation.
16. You should know that everything is agreed on for a very good nun to enter the monastery in Seville. She has 6,000 ducats free of any ties, and before entering she has given some gold ingots worth two thousand. She insists so much that they begin to pay for the house with them that the prioress is doing so and has written me that she will pay three thousand now. This made me very happy for they were carrying a great burden. Well, as soon as the nun makes profession, the prioress will pay off everything, and perhaps even before.

17. Our Father Visitator is busy organizing different things; he is well and making his visitation of the houses. It is amazing how calm the province is and how they love him. The prayers are having their good effect, as well as the virtue and talents God gives him.
18. May God be with you and keep you, for I don't know how to stop when I speak to you. All send their best regards, and I do too. Give Francisco de Salcedo my best. You are right to be fond of him, for he is a holy man. My health is very good.

19. I wrote to the bishop to ask him to send the book, for perhaps I will be stirred to finish it by writing about what the Lord has given me since. Or another large one could be written, if the Lord should desire that I be able to express myself; and if I can't, there would be no great loss.
20. There were some little things belonging to Teresa in the small chest; I'm sending them back. The little round brazier is for Pedro de Ahumada, for since he spends much time in church, his hands must get cold. I don't need any money now. May our Lord reward you for your care and watch over you for me, amen. You can entrust the matter about the money to the prioress of Valladolid, for she will take care of it very well. She knows a merchant who is a great friend of the house, and a friend of mine and a good Christian. 1. Jesus be with your reverence. Oh, my daughter, what a letter you sent me, filled with good news, as regards both your health and the nun who will render us so good a service as to pay for the house! Please God there will be no mishap. I pray for this urgently, for it would give me the greatest happiness to see you freed from the burden of debt. If she enters, help her along, for the love of God; she truly deserves it. I really wish I had more time so that I could write a long letter; but I wrote today to Avila and Madrid and elsewhere, and my head is in a terrible condition. I received your letters, the ones you mentioned. One that I",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,3,6,18,0,3,30,0,0,1,4,7,12,9,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,0
"621",1577,13,"wrote to Father Prior of Las Cuevas -- which I sent unsealed so that you could read it -- must have got lost, for you say nothing about it. You must all feel lonely without our good padre there.
2. Tell Señor Garciálvarez that he must be a father now more than ever. I am delighted that his relative has entered. Give her my best regards, and also send this letter to the nuns in Paterna (for I have so great a desire to write to them) so that they will know that I am well and was delighted with their letter and delighted to know that Margarita is going there and also a confessor. They shouldn't be surprised that those nuns do not become like us at once. To think they should would be foolish. Nor should they place so much stress on silence and other things that in themselves are not sinful. By taking away from people something they are accustomed to, you make them sin more. Time is needed so that God may do his work and you not exasperate them. We are praying very much for them here.
3. It is wrong for the prioress to allow them to insult her, unless she can do so by pretending that she didn't understand what was said. Those who govern must know that, save for matters concerning the enclosure, God will do the rest, and they should proceed with great gentleness. May he be with you, my daughter, and watch over you and all the other nuns. Give them my regards.
4. Tell the prioress of Paterna to send me news of how they are. In all her letters she pays no more attention to San Jerónimo (who may be the more efficient of the two) than if she were not there. And tell San Jerónimo to write to me; and both of them to put their trust in God so that they may succeed in everything, and that they shouldn't think they can do anything of themselves.
5. I am well. Mother Prioress of Malagón is as usual. Let me know if our padre took money for the trip, for it was my understanding that he didn't. Send him this letter, please, and do so with great caution taking care that it get to him quickly; but the carrier should be trustworthy. I am truly sorry about the departure of the public attorney. It seems God wants us to know that it is he alone who does everything. Give",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,2,10,0,9,20,1,1,3,14,3,17,10,11,1,3,1,0,0,0,0

Teresa of Jesus
6. I liked your Matins. I believe it must have gone well, for the Lord always helps at the time of greatest need. Don't fail to write me, even though our padre isn't there. I won't write so often, but that's because of the cost of the postage. 1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. My congratulations to you and your daughter on the occasion of her taking the veil. May it please God that you have the joy of her presence for many years and that you both serve him with the holiness that I have begged of him during these days, amen.
2. I would love to write a long letter to answer yours, and certainly I now have the opportunity, but it could do me great harm, for I am very tired. I already had the thought of not writing until I had more time, but I am doing this so that you will know I have received all your letters. They are arriving here very safely. I am not sending the pope's dispensation, for it is in Latin and I have not yet found anyone to translate it for me. I will send it to you later. They gave it to me yesterday, the feast of St. Sebastian. It inspired the sisters with much devotion, and me as well. May God be blessed, for thus everything has been concluded. The fact that Señora Doña María is happy makes me so as well, very much so. Give her my very best wishes, and a good embrace to my Casilda; how I would love to do so personally. It would have given me great joy to be there. You did well to pay great attention to the friars; that must have added more solemnity to the ceremony.
3. In regard to what you say about the other nun's dowry, you told me that it would be necessary to take out fifty ducats for the trip. I asked you that if this were so, why you said the dowry would be six hundred ducats. Don't specify any amount. I don't remember about the trousseau. If she is all they say she is, it makes no difference if what she brings doesn't amount to much. For I tell you that we really need talented nuns. Be assured that she will bring what she has. You",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,10,0,3,26,0,0,2,9,7,14,8,10,0,3,0,0,1,2,0
"623",1577,15,"already know that if the nuns are very suited for us, we don't have to be so concerned about the dowry. Her mistress is saddened to death that they are taking her away, from what I have been told. And this must be true, so she will not give her much help. Her master has been well informed that it must be restored to him if she does not live up to what he says of her. I have been so insistent about taking this nun that I have wondered if it were not a temptation.
4. Read the enclosed letter, close and seal it, and entrust it to Agustín de Vitoria, or to someone you are sure will deliver it promptly, for it is not possible to pay the portage and it must be delivered safely.
5. Father Visitator is so avid about your taking that house that as soon as you are in agreement, I will send Antonio Gaytán. He has been commissioned by the visitator to sign the deeds. Once this is decided, a way will be provided for dealing with that woman, for she is old and very sick, and something must be done because the need of souls there is great. May God direct the matter and watch over you, for you have carried out your affairs well. May he be blessed who does it all, for you are very wretched.
Today is 21 January.
Your servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit always be in your soul, and may he give your honor his holy love and fear, amen. Padre Doctor Pablo Hernández has written me about the favor and alms you are granting me by wanting to found a house for this holy order. Indeed, I believe that our Lord and his glorious Mother, my Patroness and Lady, has moved your heart to so holy a work, which I hope His Majesty will make good use of. And I hope you will as a result receive many spiritual blessings. May it please the Lord to accomplish this, as all the sisters and I beg him; and from now on the entire order will be praying for you. This has been a great consolation for me, and so I desire to meet you that I might offer myself in your presence as your servant; may you consider me so from now on.
2. Our Lord has been pleased to free me from the fever. I am hurrying as much as possible so that when I",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,2,2,20,1,2,20,1,0,1,7,4,12,18,11,1,1,0,1,3,1,0
"624",1577,16,"leave here things will be to my satisfaction, and I believe that with the grace of our Lord the work will soon be finished. I promise you that I won't lose time, or pay attention to my illness should the fever return, but will leave at once. It is only right that, since you are doing everything, I should do my part, which is nothing, and endure some trial. We ought not strive for anything else, those of us who seek to follow the one who, without deserving any trials, always lived in the midst of them.
3. I do not think I will gain only one benefit from this work, for according to Padre Pablo Hernández I stand to gain much from knowing you. Up to this point I have been sustained by the prayers of others, so I beg you for the love of our Lord, not to forget me in yours.
4. I think that unless His Majesty ordains otherwise I will be in that city, at the latest, two weeks after the beginning of Lent. Even though I will leave here soon, I will be stopping for a few days at the monasteries that the Lord has been pleased to found during these past years. My stay will be as short as possible, since that is your desire; although in matters that are so well taken care of, I will have nothing else to do but behold and praise our Lord. May His Majesty always guide you and give you life and health and the increase of grace that I beg of him, amen.
Today is 9 January.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite For my daughter, Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's in Seville.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. And I tell you that up here I could still add to the praises you bestow on our padre, and with the greatest sincerity. I don't know what it is that induces me to love you so much. I am now beginning to believe that you are reciprocating. May it please the Lord that this will be shown by our praying earnestly for each other.
2. Yesterday, the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul, the muleteer brought me your letters and money and all the rest. Everything was so beautifully wrapped that it was a pleasure to behold, and so everything arrived safely. May God reward you for the happiness you gave me because of what you sent to our padre's mother.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,16,0,1,20,0,0,1,9,4,5,9,6,1,0,0,0,4,2,0
"625",1577,17,"No one thus far has done so much, and he is very happy. Why shouldn't I love you so greatly, for you do nothing but please me? I only coveted somewhat the agnusdei, for I had been desiring these past days something to give to the administrator, who doesn't fail to come to my help whenever I need something. He has worked especially hard for the house in Malagón, and will continue to do so. That house is undergoing such a dry spell that, given my nature, it is a great trial for me. In every house there is some little portion of the cross, but I do not regret it.
3. God has granted me such a favor by alleviating the worries of your house and allowing everything to go so well that I have nothing to complain about. It is especially good that you give me hope that you can pay part of the debt, for when I think of your having to pay more than a ducat a day, I cannot help but be troubled. Such disturbance is beneficial because it makes me pray that God will lift the burden from you. May it please His Majesty at least to lighten it, amen.
4. To return to the agnusdei, because of the one to whom it was destined, I did not want to fail to send it, for it gave value to the rest, which looked nice. Here we took some of the balsam, since Isabelita told us they have a lot of it there, and three brinquinillos so that you don't think my Isabelita is the daughter of a bad mother who will give her nothing; those that are being sent are enough. May God reward you, my daughter, amen, amen, amen. And for the potatoes, which arrived in good condition right at the very time when I have no desire to eat! And the oranges gladdened the hearts of some of the sick nuns, although they are not seriously sick. Everything else is very good, and the sweets as well, and there are many.
5. Doña Luisa was here today, and I gave her some. Had I known that she would prize them so highly, I would have sent them to her in your name, for she is made happy by any little thing at all, but it seems better to us not to give much to these ladies. My brother sent me the best box from those you sent him. I am glad that this",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,0,4,4,9,0,10,22,2,0,3,4,8,9,13,4,2,0,2,1,2,1,1
"626",1577,18,"didn't cost you anything. You can, then, when you think it is appropriate, ask for something for some person you consider worthy, or if you are given a gift, say that you are accepting it for so and so or some specific person; then you would not be giving away what belongs to the monastery.
6. I had not sent the prioress of Malagón any of the sweets my brother sent me because of the high fever she has; they would kill her. And I wouldn't want you to send her any gift that would worsen her fever. But it would be very good if you sent her other things, such as sweet oranges, for she suffers from nausea, and other items suitable for a sick person. I would like so much to bring her here. Now I am hoping to get water from Loja. I have written to our padre to let us know if he stops there, for I will send someone to get it. I think she is being well cared for, for I insist very much on that. What she most prefers now are mantequillas.
7. I would like to respond at length to your letters, for I have received them all, but the muleteer is leaving tomorrow and you can see all the correspondence I am including for our padre. I apologize for the cost of the portage, but this is something so important that it is necessary to have a good carrier. And you, too, should get Padre Fray Gregorio and ask him for me to send the letters quickly with some trustworthy person -- Diego if he is there -- for out of love for me he will do so gladly. If the person is not trustworthy or going immediately, they shouldn't be given to anyone, for I wouldn't dare send some of the letters unless the carrier were very safe.
8. The orders sent me by the general while I was down there have also been seen here. They forbid not only me but all the nuns to go out, so that the nuns cannot leave their monasteries to be prioresses or for any other reason. And if our padre's commission were to end, everything would be destroyed. For although we are subject to the discalced friars, being so is not enough unless as commissary our padre declares we have this permission. His statement is sufficient for me and for the nuns, but at any moment something could happen to change this.
9. So,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,5,1,5,17,0,2,1,8,3,21,26,5,3,1,0,0,4,1,1
"627",1577,19,"make every effort, for goodness' sake. And whoever is the carrier should wait for our padre to prepare the statement, which won't take much time, and bring it back to you. And if you can't send it with the muleteer, paying well for the portage, don't send it. Tell our padre that I told you to have him send it to you. It's strange how stupid we have been. The administrator has examined it, who is a great legal scholar, and Doctor Velázquez. They both say this can be done and are sending instructions. May God do what is most suited for his service, for they are ordering me to get this in a hurry, and so I am doing it.
10. It's lucky you didn't give the money to Antonio Ruiz, for the manager who was to bring it is here. I had already told the one who is in charge of paying the portage for me to give the twenty reales so that we don't get in debt over trifles; but he will do what you say. We also took a little of the courbaril resin. I had wanted to write and ask you to send some, for some pastilles may be made from it with rose-colored sugar that are very helpful for my rheumatism. There is still a lot left over. Next Tuesday they will deliver the package with care.
11. I was especially delighted to learn that you are well. Be careful that you don't start acting as though you are healthy. We don't want to begin worrying again, for you made me go through some anxious moments. My regards to the subprioress, to all the nuns, and to everyone. I will write soon through the mail carrier. No more now except that Casilda has made her profession.
May God keep you, my daughter, and make you holy, amen.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
Greetings to Garciálvarez and his cousin, and to all. 1. Jesus be with your honor. I have now recovered from the exhaustion of the other day. Since I thought I had too much bile and fearing that my condition would hinder me from observing the Lenten fast, I took a purgative. That day there were so many letters and business matters to attend to that I kept writing letters until two in the morning. This did my head so much harm that I believe the experience has been for my benefit because the doctor has given me orders never to go on writing after midnight,",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13,0,0,5,7,0,7,11,3,1,0,5,8,5,10,4,0,2,0,1,4,0,1
"628",1577,20,"and that sometimes I should get someone else to write my letters.
2. And certainly the work of letter-writing has gone to excess this winter. And I am very much to blame because I sacrificed sleep so as not to have my morning disturbed, and since I did my writing after the vomiting everything worked together in doing me harm. On the day in which I took the purgative I became especially sick, but it seems I am getting better. So you needn't be disturbed, for I am taking good care of myself. I have mentioned this so that you will know why it will be, sometimes, that a letter for you is not in my handwriting or is shorter in length.
3. I am pampering myself as much as I can, and so I was annoyed with what you sent me, for I prefer that you eat them yourself. Sweets are not for me, although I did eat some and will eat the rest. But don't do this again for it displeases me greatly. Isn't it enough that I never send you any delicacies?
4. I don't know what paternostres those are that you say when taking the discipline, for I never told you anything like that. Read my letter again, and you will see what I said; and don't take the discipline any more than is mentioned there. In no way should it be taken more than twice a week. In Lent you may wear the hairshirt once a week provided that you remove it if you see it is doing you harm. Since you are so sanguine, I fear very much your doing this. And since taking the discipline can be bad for the eyesight, I don't agree to your taking it any more often. Also it is a greater penance to practice moderation after having begun, which amounts to breaking the will. You must let me know if the hairshirt makes you feel ill when you wear it.
5. That calm prayer you mention is the prayer of quiet which is described in that little book. As for those sensual stirrings, so that you be tried in every way, as I told you, I see clearly that this is not a matter of importance and that the best thing you can do is to pay no attention to them. Once a very learned man told me that a man came to him extremely distressed because every time he received communion a terribly lascivious mood came over him (much",1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,7,2,0,1,4,0,10,10,4,2,0,9,7,7,14,9,4,3,3,6,3,0,3
"629",1577,21,"worse than your experience) and that he had been ordered not to receive communion more than once a year, which was enough to fulfill his obligation. And this learned man, although he was not a spiritual person, understood the weakness and told him that he should pay no attention to it and receive communion every eight days. And the trouble went away when the man lost the fear of it. So, you shouldn't pay any attention to this.
6. You can speak with Julián de Avila about anything, for he is very good. He tells me he gets along well with you, and that makes me happy. Go to see him from time to time, and when you want to do some favor for him, give him an alms, for he is very poor and detached from riches, in my opinion. He is one of the better priests there, and it is good to have conversations like this, for everything doesn't have to be prayer.
7. As for sleep, I tell you and command you that it not be less than six hours. Consider how necessary it is for us who are older to take care of these bodies so that they do not tear down the spirit, which is a terrible trial. You wouldn't believe the displeasure I feel these days, for I don't dare pray or read, although, as I say, I am now feeling better. But I have learned my lesson, I'm telling you. So, do what you are told; this is how you will fulfill your duties to God. How foolish it is to think that this is like the prayer that did not allow me to sleep! There is no likeness between them, for I tried much harder to sleep than to stay awake.
8. Certainly I fervently praise the Lord for the favors he grants you and for the effects that follow. You can see how great they are by the virtues you are given, which you would not have been able to acquire even after much effort. You should know that the weakness of the head doesn't depend on eating or drinking; do what I tell you. The Lord is doing me a great favor by giving you such good health. May it please His Majesty to give you many years to spend in his service.
9. This fear that you mention, I think certainly must come from the fact that your spirit senses the evil spirit, and although you do not see it with",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,7,2,0,5,12,0,10,22,2,1,1,15,8,7,8,7,3,2,3,5,3,0,2
"630",1577,22,"your bodily eyes, the soul must see or feel it. Keep holy water nearby, for there is nothing that has so much power to make him take flight. It has often helped me. Some did not stop at causing fear, but tormented me greatly; this is for you alone. But if the holy water does not get sprinkled on him, he will not flee, and so it is necessary to sprinkle it all around.
10. Don't think your sleeping so well is a small favor from God, for it is a very great one. And I repeat, don't try to go without sleep; this is not the time for that.
11. It seems to me to be the sign of great charity to desire to take trials for yourself and to give delight to others, and it is a great favor from God that you can even think about doing this. But, on the other hand, it is great foolishness and a lack of humility to imagine that you could possess the virtues Francisco de Salcedo has, or those that God has given you, without prayer. Believe me and let the Lord of the vineyard work, for he knows what each one needs. I have never asked him for interior trials, although he has given me many and truly heavy ones in this life. One's natural constitution and humors have a large part to play in these afflictions. I am glad you are getting to understand the temperament of that saint, for I would like you to be tolerant of his disposition.
12. You should know that I foresaw the effect the judgment would have on him and that he would feel hurt, but it wasn't possible to answer in a serious vein. And if you saw my answer, I didn't fail to praise some of the things he said. Regarding my answer to your response, I couldn't have said anything else without lying. I tell you definitely that my head was in such a condition that I don't even know how I said what I did. That day the business matters and letters had so piled up that it seemed, as it does sometimes, that the devil had done this. And my night was a bad one, for the purgative did me harm. And it was a miracle that I didn't send a letter I had written to Padre Gracián's mother to the Bishop of Cartagena, for I had put it in the envelope addressed to him; I can't thank",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,12,0,10,20,1,1,3,16,5,12,12,6,3,3,4,7,1,0,2
"631",1577,23,"God enough. I was writing to the bishop about what was happening between the nuns of Caravaca and the vicar general, whom I have never seen. It seems to be a crazy thing; he's forbidden Mass to be said for them. Now this has been taken care of, and the rest I think will turn out all right, which is that he accept the monastery. He can't do otherwise. Enclosed with mine were some other letters of recommendation. See what could have happened, along with my departure from here!
13. We still have fear of this Tostado, who is returning to Madrid. Pray for this. Read the enclosed letter from the prioress in Seville. I was delighted with the one she sent me from you, and the one you wrote to the sisters, which certainly is charming. They all kiss your hands many times, for they were delighted with your letter, and especially my companion. She is the one who is fifty years old and came with us from Malagón. She is extremely good and most wise. At least she is extremely good in watching out for my well-being and shows great concern for me.
14. The prioress of Valladolid wrote me about how everything that could be done in the matter was being done, for Pedro de Ahumada was there. I believe that the merchant who is in charge of the affair will do well. My regards to him and to my little boys, especially Francisco, for I long to see them. You did well in letting the servant girl go, even though there was no occasion to do so, for they don't do anything but get in each other's way when there are so many. Greetings to Doña Juana, Pedro Alvarez, and to all. You should know that my head is much better now than when I began this letter. I don't know if this is not caused by the delight I find in speaking with you.
15. Today Doctor Velázquez was here, who is my confessor. I spoke to him about what you tell me regarding the silver and the tapestries you want to give up, for I didn't want you to fail to advance in the service of God because of my not helping you. There are cases in which I do not trust my opinion, although in this matter his opinion was the same as mine. He says that these things don't have significance as long as you strive to see how little they matter and",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,1,7,0,4,17,2,0,1,8,4,6,7,8,5,4,1,2,1,1,0
"632",1577,24,"are detached from them, and that it is reasonable to have a home appropriately furnished since you have sons whom you will have to marry off. So for now be patient, for God usually always provides the occasion for carrying out good desires, and he will do so for you. May God keep you and make you very holy, amen.
It is 10 February.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, mi padre. I'm not surprised that you are sick, but rather that you are alive after what you must have undergone there both interiorly and exteriorly. I felt infinitely distressed when they told me you were in bed because I know you. Since the illness is not dangerous, although painful, I was very much consoled. I was wondering if you hadn't caught some cold since you travel about so much. Let me know in a detailed way how you are, for love of God -- for even if it is in the handwriting of Padre Miseria, I will be happy -- and whether you need anything. And let nothing cause you distress, for whenever things seem to be going well I am usually less happy than I am now. You already know that the Lord wants us to see that it is His Majesty who does what is good for us. That we come to understand this better and know that the work is his, he usually permits a thousand setbacks. It is then that everything turns out best.
2. I am told nothing about Padre Padilla, which troubles me, nor does he write to me. I would like him to be healthy so that he could care for you. Since Padre Baltasar has to leave, may it please the Lord that you recover your health quickly. I am writing to those Fathers about what was done and what I think about it. This messenger has no other task to carry out.
3. You know, mi padre, I have considered how much we will miss the good nuncio, for, after all, he is a servant of God. His departure would trouble me deeply, and I think that what remains to be done is due to the fact that his hands are tied more than we think. I have a great fear that while negotiations are going on in Rome they will have trouble, for there is someone there continually trying to keep things tied up. I recall that the good Nicolao",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,0,12,1,10,17,4,1,2,15,11,10,12,5,1,0,3,1,6,1,0
"633",1577,25,"said, when he passed through here, that the discalced friars would have to get a Cardinal Protector. Today I spoke with a relative, who seems honest, who told me that he knows a prudent person in the curia in Rome who if we paid him would do all that we want. I at once told him that I wanted to have someone there who could discuss matters with Our Father General. See if it would be good for the ambassador to petition him in favor of the discalced friars.
4. You should know that Padre Fray Pedro Fernández was here. He says that if Tostado does not have power over the visitators, the acts remain in force. But he says that if he does, we have only to be silent and obey, for he thinks that the commissaries cannot set up provinces and appoint definitors if they do not receive more authority than they have had. So it is good that we look for help elsewhere. May God help us, for he will do everything, and in his mercy restore you to health quickly, as we are all begging him.
This messenger is not going to Madrid for any other purpose than to see what they want done and to get news about you.
5. Please tell Padre Juan Díaz to deliver these letters to Padre Olea, for they are very important to me, or send for him and give them to him very secretly if you cannot get them to him in another way.
Today is 16 February.
Your Reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence. Since I was waiting for a letter from the Carmelite prior, I mean an answer from him, I had not sent a mail carrier. And that was fortunate because the one who is carrying this is Señor Diego Pérez. I praised the Lord to see him free. It really seems that he is an authentic servant of God, for our Lord has tried him in suffering. It's a pity to see the condition the world is in.
2. If a letter from Señora Doña Luisa de la Cerda is necessary for your negotiations, you should know that she is not here but in Paracuellos, near Madrid, three leagues from there. This padre pleased me very much; he must have a great talent for every kind of good.
3. The Carmelite prior's decision, according to what Maestro Córdoba said, in the presence of Señor Diego Pérez, is that until he sees the permission for the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,8,0,2,12,0,0,2,9,5,17,15,6,6,6,0,0,1,0,0
"634",1577,26,"foundation of the monastery given in the handwriting of our most Reverend Father General he will do everything he can to oppose it. He says that there is no reformer and that the nuncio can do nothing except by means of one. And he is so convinced of this and that the discalced friars are acting against obedience, since they are not obliged to follow the visitators but their general, that it would have been useless for me to have said anything to the contrary. Diego Pérez could not even persuade him. He says also that the king, having seen how the discalced friars are living in disobedience, has given the command that his ordinance coming through the royal council be issued.
4. I tell you that it is something for which to praise God, the way those Fathers carry on their affairs. I was quick to believe their assertion that they had a new brief, but it is the one from the general chapter given a year and a half ago. Maestro Córdoba saw it today. I think he is a cousin of Padre Fray Alonso Hernández, and I don't know why -- since he has it there -- he doesn't inform them how matters stand.
5. If the prior's response to his lordship should arrive before this letter goes out, I'll send it along also; otherwise, let me know if I should send it to the archdeacon. But until the king's orders are nullified, it is useless; once they are, quick action will be necessary. Let us avoid tiring others. Padre Diego Pérez could tell his lordship the prior's answer since he has heard it. I don't think the archdeacon could answer so quickly, and it's better that his lordship be informed. Please God your health is better, for I am very worried about you.
Today is 18 February.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your honor. Before I forget, as I have at other times, tell Francisco to send me some well-cut pens. There aren't any good ones around here, they are a nuisance and make my task harder. Never prevent him from writing to me, for perhaps he may have a need to. He is satisfied with a few words for an answer and they don't cost me anything.
2. I think this illness will end up serving a good purpose, for I am beginning to get accustomed to having another do my writing for me. I could have already done so in matters of",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,9,0,4,9,2,0,2,12,11,10,10,3,2,4,1,0,4,0,0
"635",1577,27,"little importance; I will continue doing this now. I am much better, for I have taken some pills. I think it did me harm to start fasting during Lent, for it wasn't only my head but my heart as well that was affected. The heart is much better, and even the head has improved the last couple of days, for that is what caused the most pain -- which wasn't little. I was afraid I might become incapacitated for everything. It would have been a serious imprudence to try to practice prayer. And our Lord sees clearly the harm this would have done me. I don't experience any more supernatural recollection. It is as though I had never received any, which truly surprises me, for it wasn't possible for me to resist. Don't be troubled, for little by little my head will become stronger. I take all the care of myself that I see is necessary, and even a little more than is the custom here. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to practice prayer.
3. I have a strong desire to get well. My illness is at a cost to you. For this reason I think my desire is good. I am in such a condition that I need to get better so as not to be a burden. Since mutton does not agree with me, I always have to eat fowl. The root of the whole problem is weakness from my having fasted since the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross in September along with all my work and at my age. Well, to see myself capable of so little is bothersome, for this body of mine has always done me harm and prevented me from good. I'm not so bad off that I cannot write to you myself. I will not inflict this mortification on you for now, which would be a great one judging from myself.
4. As regards the mortification of not being able to use the hairshirt, you will have to pardon me for imposing it on you, for you must not be doing what you choose to do. You should know that the discipline ought to be taken for only a short duration. In that way, you feel it more and it is less likely to do harm. Don't hit yourself too hard; this won't matter even though you may think it is a great imperfection. That you might do something of what you would wish, I am sending you this hairshirt you",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,1,3,0,14,18,1,2,0,10,7,13,10,10,3,0,4,8,4,0,1
"636",1577,28,"can wear on two days during the week, by which I mean from the time you get up until you go to bed; don't wear it while sleeping. I was amused by the precision with which you count the days. This is a new practice, and I don't believe the discalced Carmelite nuns have attained to such resourcefulness. See that you never wear the other one; store it away for now.
5. I am sending one to Teresa and also a discipline that she requested of me, a very hard one. Have it sent to her with my best regards. Julián de Avila in writing me has many good things to say about her, which moves me to praise the Lord. May he guide her always, for he has granted a great favor to her, and to us who love her dearly.
6. In a certain way I had desired that you experience some aridity during these days, and so I was delighted when I saw your letter, although what you mentioned cannot be called aridity. Think that what you experience is beneficial for many reasons. If this hairshirt fits all around the waist, place a little linen cloth between it and the stomach. And be careful so that if you feel any discomfort around the kidneys you do not wear it or take the discipline, for you will suffer harm. God desires your health more than your penance, and that you obey. Remember about Saul, and don't do otherwise. You will be doing no small thing if you learn how to put up with that person's disposition, for I hold that the source of all those troubles and sorrows is melancholy, which has a tight control on him. So, there is no fault or anything for us to be surprised about; we should praise the Lord that he does not give us this torment.
7. Take great care not to give up sleep and to eat enough at your collation, for with your desire to do something for God you will not notice anything until the harm is done. And I tell you that I had to learn my lesson for the sake of myself and others. In a certain sense the daily use of the hairshirt is less of a burden because through habit the novelty of which you speak wears off. You shouldn't tighten it around the shoulders the way you usually do. Be careful that none of these things do you any harm. God is granting you",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,9,0,10,18,1,0,3,11,7,8,13,7,2,2,6,12,1,1,2
"637",1577,29,"a great favor by your being able to bear so well the lack of prayer, for this is a sign that you are resigned to his will. This I believe is the greatest good that prayer brings about.
8. There is good news about my papers. The Grand Inquisitor himself read them, which is something new -- he must have heard some praise of them -- and told Doña Luisa that they contained nothing the Inquisition would have to deal with, and that there were good things in them rather than bad. And he asked her why I hadn't founded a monastery in Madrid. He is very favorable toward the discalced friars. He is the one who has now been made Archbishop of Toledo. I believe Doña Luisa went to see him there where he is, and recommended this matter strongly, for they are great friends, and she wrote to me about it. She will be coming soon and I will find out the rest. You may tell this to the bishop, the subprioress, and Isabel de San Pablo (in secret, so that they don't tell anyone but pray for this matter), and to no other person. This is very good news. My stay here has been beneficial for everything, except for my head because I have had more letters to write than elsewhere.
9. In the letter from the prioress you will see how they have paid half of the amount on the house, without touching the dowry of Beatriz and her mother. They will soon pay everything with the Lord's help. I was delighted with it, as also with that letter from Agustín and to know that he is not going down there. I was sorry that you had already sent a letter without mine. I will have one from the Marchioness of Villena for the viceroy -- she is his beloved niece -- when they can be sent safely. It grieves me to see him still involved in these things. Pray for him, which is what I am doing.
10. Regarding what you say about holy water, I don't know the reason but only what I experience. I have mentioned this to some learned men and they did not object to it. It's enough that the Church uses it, as you say.
Despite all the difficulties that the nun reformers are having, many sins are being prevented by them.
11. There is a lot of truth in what Francisco de Salcedo says regarding Señora Ospedal -- at least that in",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,2,12,1,6,18,0,0,2,8,7,4,6,5,3,4,1,1,0,0,1
"638",1577,30,"this instance I am like her. Give my best regards to him, and to Pedro de Ahumada also. I do not want to write any more except that you look to see if you could give Juan de Ovalle what he needs to buy some sheep. This would be most helpful to him and a great act of charity, if you can do it without a loss to yourself.
12. I have changed pens so often in this letter that my handwriting will seem worse than usual; it is due to this and not to my being sick. I wrote this yesterday, and today when I got up I felt better, glory to God. The fear of remaining incapacitated is worse than the illness.
13. My companion has been charming in her words about the stone paver. She told me such wonderful things about him that I told her to write to you. Nonetheless, I think that since the prioress says he is reputable, she ought to know. I don't think he would do a bad job, seeing that she knows both workers; although I always thought that Vitoria would be best suited. Please God the work will be done well, and may he keep you, as I beg him, for his service, amen. Today is 28 February.
14. Father Visitator is well. Now Tostado is returning, according to what they say. From the way all these affairs of ours are going one learns what the world is, for it seems to be nothing but a farce. Nonetheless, I long to see him freed of all those affairs. May the Lord do as he sees is necessary. The prioress and all the nuns send their regards. The prioress of Seville pampers me as does also the prioress of Salamanca. And even those of Beas and Caravaca have not failed to do what they can; in short, they show their concern.
15. I would like to be near you so that you could see all of this, and also, that I could have the pleasure of sending some of it to you. Even just now some very tasty shad arrived from Seville wrapped in bread. I was delighted for there is a great scarcity of fish in this town. Seeing the affection with which they do it is what pleases me.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of San José in Seville.
1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. Because of the illness described on the enclosed piece of paper, I have",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,8,1,0,2,7,0,6,21,1,0,2,9,3,12,12,6,7,2,1,0,3,0,2
"639",1577,31,"not been writing to you, waiting until I felt better so as not to cause you any grief. Although I am much better, I can still do only a little writing; otherwise I immediately feel the harm it does me. But in comparison with how I was a short time ago, the improvement is great, glory to God. May he repay you for the good news you sent me, for I tell you it truly was good news for me, at least regarding the house. What a relief it is to see you free of debt. I have prayed hard for this here, and so will gladly tell about the good news.
2. May God be pleased to hear my prayer, for now with your riches, the office entrusted to you, and the fact that everything is going so well, you will need much help in order to be humble. It seems to me that God is doing this through the favors he is granting you. May he be forever blessed, for you can be very sure that it is he who is bestowing them on you.
3. Would that I could feel the same about San Jerónimo. This woman really makes me suffer. Believe me, she should not have separated herself from me or gone where she could be in fear. Please God the devil will not cause us any trouble, or we will have our hands full. You should advise the prioress -- until my letter arrives -- not to allow her to write a word and to tell her that I think she has become the prey of a very bad humor, and that if this is not so, the matter becomes worse. Since the muleteer is leaving next Monday, at which time I will send a long letter, I am not saying anything more here.
4. God help me, how rich you are! These nuns are amazed at what you sent me. The food arrived ready to eat, and all the rest was beautiful, especially the reliquaries. The large one will be better for Señora Doña Luisa. We have fixed it very nicely, for it arrived with the glass broken, and we have put in new glass and made a solid base for it. I will say more about this when I write at length later. Remain with God.
5. I was most displeased that our padre refuted the things said against us, especially the very indecent things, for they are foolish. The best thing to do is",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,4,11,1,9,27,1,0,2,8,8,7,11,6,2,4,5,1,0,0,2
"640",1577,32,"to laugh at them, and let the matter pass. As for me, in a certain way, these things please me.
I am most happy about your health. May God keep you for me, and all the nuns, amen. Pray for me.
6. Because this letter will perhaps go first, I didn't want to neglect writing by this means. I will write to Mother Subprioress, because her complaints amused me. The prioress in Malagón is doing very badly. Today is the last day of February.
Your reverence's unworthy servant ,
Teresa of Jesus
7. For some days I have been holding on to the reply from our padre's mother. It will go out on Monday. She also wrote to me at length about the joy you brought her. 1. Jesus be with your reverence, mi padre. Today Señor Don Teutonio, who is in Madrid, wrote me that the nuncio is not going to leave. If this is true -- unless you stay in Alcalá under the pretext of being ill -- you must in no way give the impression that you are disobedient.
2. You should know, padre, from what I understand, that these Fathers would now like to be our friends; and until we see what God ordains, it is good to be compliant, as you have been. Certainly I do not cast blame on the nuncio, but the devil's battery is of the kind that nothing would surprise me. You shouldn't fear that no one will dare defend you, for the Lord is your keeper. Since up to the present he has granted us the favor of helping you hold your temper in check, may you continue doing so. Let this be your cross for now, certainly no small one. If the Lord had not helped you in a special way, I don't believe you would have been able to put up with so much.
3. As for the Council's response, there is nothing to hope for. Don't you see that these are all polite words? What need is there to have this directive sent from here so that it can be annulled, since they have a copy of it there and know that it is authentic? Now is not the time. Let us wait a little, for the Lord knows what it is he is doing better than we know what it is we want.
4. What do you think of how they make us appear in this piece of writing? I don't know why one tries to refute these things. Our padre is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,11,0,6,19,1,2,1,9,8,12,10,7,2,0,0,0,2,0,0
"641",1577,33,"making a mistake, for this is something utterly base. For the love of God, don't show it to anyone, for they would think it imprudent to pay any attention to such foolishness or talk about it. I think it would be very imperfect to do anything about it, except laugh.
5. You should know, mi padre, that my heavy correspondence and many other duties that I tried to handle all alone have caused a noise and weakness in my head. And I have been given orders that unless it's very necessary I should not be writing letters in my own hand, and so I will not be long. I only say that as regards what you said you want to procure from the king, don't think about doing it until you have considered it most carefully, for in my opinion we would lose much of our credibility. God will do what is necessary by another means. May he watch over you for me.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of San José in Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. After so much good news and the many gifts you have sent me, I have every reason to write a long letter; at least doing this would make me very happy. But I wrote you yesterday and the labor this winter of letter-writing has so weakened my head that I have been truly sick. I am much better, but nevertheless, I almost never write in my own hand, for they say I must not do so if I want to recover completely.
2. Oh, how delighted I was with the beautiful things you sent me through the administrator. You wouldn't believe how much work he takes on for the monastery in Malagón and how ready he is to help me. And don't think it takes little effort to keep the construction work going well, for there are a thousand things that have to be attended to with the workmen. I gave him the small reliquary. Both are very lovely, but the large one is still better; especially the way it was embellished here, for it arrived with the glass broken as I wrote you. New glass was put in that looks very nice. The base was twisted, so we had an iron one cast. This should have been done in the first place. I also gave him the jar, I mean the little cup, which was the most charming I've ever seen.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,1,7,0,6,16,0,0,2,11,7,13,11,9,4,4,3,4,3,1,0
"642",1577,34,"Don't think that because I have to wear a habit of finer material, things have got so bad that I need to drink from something as nice as that! I also gave him the bottle just as it was. He greatly appreciated this. He is a man of integrity. Well, from down there you have helped your house in Malagón. They wouldn't let me give away the orange-flower water, because it gives life to the prioress and is beneficial for me too, and we didn't have any. Ask for some, on my part, from the mother of the Portuguese nun and have it sent to us. Do this out of charity -- that is the condition.
3. Oh, how happy I am that you have paid off the debt on the house. But until that nun is professed we ought not rejoice too much. It is true, though, that if that should not happen, God will provide in another way. Pray hard that he might be pleased to take away this trouble I have with my head. Today, by the mail carrier, I sent you an account of what in part brought it on.
4. Your manner of prayer makes me happy. Recognizing that you have it and that God is doing you a favor is not a lack of humility since you understand that it is not your doing but his. That is how we know that the prayer is from God. I greatly praise him that you are faring so well, and I will try to give him joyful thanks as you ask me. Ask God that I might be the kind of person whose prayers he will answer.
5. In regard to Beatriz, her prayer is good, but insofar as possible avoid paying attention to these things in conversations or any other way. You know this depends very much on the prioress. San Jerónimo did not speak of that here, because the prioress immediately interrupted and scolded her, and so she kept quiet. And you saw that when I was there she never carried on in this way. I don't know whether we were wrong in letting her leave our midst. Please God things will turn out well.
6. Think what would have happened if the others rather than the prioress had found the page! May God pardon the one who has told her to write. Our padre would like me to write to her in a severe manner with respect to this. Read the enclosed letter that I",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,5,14,0,6,19,1,1,0,11,8,10,12,2,2,2,1,2,1,0,2
"643",1577,35,"am writing her, and if it seems all right to you, send it to her. You are doing extremely well in not allowing anyone to talk about it to others. The prioress in Beas writes me that the nuns speak only of their sins with their confessor and that they are all finished within a half hour. She tells me that it should be like this everywhere, that they are all very much at peace, and that they have a great love for their prioress in whom they confide. Since I have some experience in this matter, you could ask them why they don't write to me but go and ask someone who perhaps doesn't have as much I do. And in a matter like this it would be fitting more than in any other. And tell San Francisco to make her eat meat after Lent is over and not let her fast.
7. I would like to know what she means when, without explaining, she speaks of the great force that God uses over her. What a trial it is that she now goes around weeping all the time in front of others and is seen as ready to write at any moment. Get what she wrote and send it to me. And remove any hope she has of speaking about this with anyone other than our padre, because those conversations have ruined her. Be aware that this language is understood there less than you think. However if it is used in confession and with Padre Acosta no harm can come. But I know well that it is less fitting for her than for anyone. It is a good thing the order was given that in Paterna more leeway could be allowed to the nuns, although it would have been better if from the start they had required only what was obligatory. In these matters of reform, if the nuns obtain something by shouting, it seems to them at once that they will obtain everything else in the same way. You did very well in advising them to live in community.
8. I have not given the letters or reliquary to Doña Luisa because she was away and returned the day before yesterday. I am waiting for all the visits to die down. Pray for her and for Doña Guiomar, for they have many trials.
9. Since I am not writing this letter all at once, I don't know whether I may have forgotten to answer any of the things",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,8,1,4,14,0,0,2,13,11,11,20,8,1,4,0,0,0,1,1
"644",1577,36,"you asked about. Since these bolts I am sending are similar to the ones that are here on the grille in the choir, I don't think it's necessary that they be more attractive, although I suppose you won't be satisfied with them. But do as they do here, for the nuns here don't consider themselves less refined than you, and a little bolt is better than something else, for I don't know what kind of locks you want. The crucifixes are being made. I believe they will cost a ducat.
10. All the nuns ask for your prayers, and Isabel was delighted with the sweets and the coarse woolen cloth. May God reward you. As for myself, I have plenty of clothes. Do you think it doesn't sadden me to have nothing to send you? It certainly does. But the barrenness of this region is incredible except for the quinces when they are in season, and even then, the quinces down there are much better. The nuns were delighted with the spices and the catamaca. They didn't allow me to send any to anyone -- I very much would have liked to -- for many have great need for it.
11. Enclosed are the responses to the question I posed to my brother. The respondents had decided to submit their answers to the judgment of the nuns at St. Joseph's in Avila. The bishop was present and told them to send the answers to me so that I might judge them, just when my head was in too miserable a state even to read them. Show them to Father Prior and to Nicolao, but you must explain to them what was being done, and don't let them read the judgments before reading the answers they submitted. And if you can, send them back so that our padre can enjoy them -- for that is why they sent them to me from Avila -- even though this may not be along the muleteer's way.
12. I am sending you this letter that my brother wrote me (he writes many about the favors that God grants him and this one was near at hand). I think it will make you happy since you are fond of him. Tear it up right away, and remain with God, for I'll never end this and writing is bad for me. May His Majesty make you a saint.
13. Now they have just given me a letter written by our padre from Málaga fifteen days ago, I mean",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,1,11,0,3,15,1,0,2,13,8,5,10,5,0,1,1,3,0,0,0
"645",1577,37,"from tomorrow. He is well, glory to God. Today is 2 March.
My regards to all, and let me know about Fray Bartolomé's health.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
14. Be grateful that I wrote this out myself, for I haven't been writing my own letters even to St. Joseph's in Avila. Yesterday I wrote to you and to our padre through the mail carrier. Thus, I'm not doing so now. 1. Jesus be with your reverence, my padre. I don't know why you neglected to write to me through this muleteer and acknowledge that you have received the answer from the Council which I sent you last Thursday. I would like to know how you can be in that city without living with the friars, I mean in the Carmelite monastery, since the nuncio has insisted so much on this. It's only right that we not displease him in anything; it would not be fitting for us to do so. I would very much like to speak with you because there are things that can be spoken but not written.
2. Up until now with the expectation of having a house there, any arrangement seemed acceptable. But believe me, padre, so prolonged a stay, and with four discalced friars, doesn't seem right to anyone, and it attracts attention, and not just the attention of the friars of the cloth, which we don't have to be concerned about. But I would not want us to provide the slightest occasion for criticism by doing anything that would give the appearance of non-compliance. Pay no attention to the fact that the marquis tells you the nuncio would not be displeased.
3. I also beg you to speak with great caution, whether you have any complaints about the nuncio or not. Because of your frankness -- with which I am familiar -- I fear that you are careless about this; please God nothing will reach his ears. You must realize that all the devils are waging war against us, and that it is necessary to look for support only from God. This we do by obeying and suffering, and then he will take over.
4. I would think it very fitting that when Passion Sunday comes you and the other discalced friars go to your monastery in Pastrana or Alcalá, for it isn't the appropriate time for carrying on business. If there is some business to be attended to, it's enough that the licentiate Padilla be there to take care of it as he has always been.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,3,8,1,8,12,1,2,2,15,7,11,11,6,1,4,0,1,2,1,0
"646",1577,38,"Days such as these are not the time for religious to be outside their monasteries. It wouldn't look good to anyone, much less to the nuncio who is so retiring. It would be very consoling to me if you did this. Think it over carefully and realize that it is the appropriate thing to do. Otherwise you will have to live with the friars of the cloth, which I think would be worse.
5. Be very careful not to talk with the archbishop. Once he is informed, it isn't fitting for you to insist even if you have the opportunity to speak with him. He has accepted responsibility for the matter. After this, the best way to carry on the business is to be silent and speak with God.
6. This letter has been written after much reflection and with more than one reason, all of which I cannot go into. But I see that it is very advisable for you to do what I am asking. No harm could come to us from your doing so and a great deal if you do not do so. When we see that something is right, there is no reason to delay. Our Lord gives us many opportunities in which to merit, and I am aware of those you have had and do have, for I am amazed by how you have controlled your temper. But now prudence is necessary and God is giving it to you as he did in that matter with the bishop. May he be blessed forever, for in the end he will favor his work.
7. They say that Tostado is coming by way of Andalusia. God be with him whatever may happen. I think it will be better to have to contend with him than with the one we have had to contend with up until now. May God give us light, and may he watch over you and those Fathers who are with you. I am a little better.
Today is 15 March.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor and repay you for the consolation your letter brought me. It came just when I was most concerned about finding someone through whom I could send a letter and give you news of myself, for it is only right that I not neglect you. I will be delaying a little more than I said in my letter, but I assure you I will not be wasting a moment. Fifteen days have not",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,13,0,4,17,0,1,1,11,4,8,12,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0
"647",1577,39,"gone by since we moved from our other house. The move was made in a very solemn procession and with much devotion. May the Lord be blessed for everything.
2. Since Wednesday I have been staying with Señora Doña María de Mendoza; because she has been ill, she hasn't been able to see me, and I needed to talk to her about some matters. I thought of staying for only a day, but the weather got so cold, with snow and ice, that it seemed traveling would have been unbearable; so I have been here until today, Saturday. I will definitely leave for Medina on Monday, with the Lord's help. And despite my hurry I will be staying there and at St. Joseph's in Avila more than fifteen days because of some business matters I must attend to. So I think I will be detained longer than I had said. You will forgive me, for from what I have mentioned here, you will see that I cannot help the delay. It will not be a long one. I beg you not to proceed with buying a house until I arrive; I want it to be suitable for our purposes since both you and he who is in glory are giving us the alms.
3. With regard to the licenses, the one from the king will be gotten easily, with heaven's help, even though some trouble might arise. My experience is that the devil bears up badly with these houses, and so is always persecuting us. But the Lord can do all things, and the devil is routed.
4. Here we have met with very great opposition, and from the most renowned persons in this locality; at present everything has been ironed out. You shouldn't think you must give our Lord only what you now have in mind, but much more. His Majesty shows his gratitude for good works by asking for more, and it's nothing to give money, for doing so causes us little pain. When they throw stones at you and your son-in-law and all of us who take part in this effort, as was almost done in Avila when St. Joseph's was founded, then the work will prosper. And I will be sure that the monastery will suffer no loss, nor will those of us who undergo trials, but that much good will come about. May the Lord guide everything as he sees is fitting. You should not be sad. It made me sad not to have mi padre",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,10,0,9,13,0,0,5,5,10,7,9,10,3,1,1,0,2,0,0
"648",1577,40,"here. If necessary, we will try to have him come. Indeed, the devil is already beginning. May God be blessed, for if we do not fail him, he will not fail us.
5. I truly long to see you, for I think this will bring me much consolation, and then I will respond to the kindnesses you show me in your letter. Please God I will find you and your son-in-law in good health. I earnestly beg both of you for prayers. You see, with my wretched health, I need them for these journeys, although the fevers have not returned. I will take care -- and I am doing so -- of what you asked of me, and these sisters likewise. All of them beg for your prayers. May the Lord always lead you by the hand, amen.
Today is 19 February. Written in Valladolid.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
6. Would you, in charity, have the enclosed letter given to Doña Luisa as well as my best wishes. I don't have time to write to Señor Diego de Avila, and even the letter to Señora Doña Luisa is not written in my hand. Would you tell her about my health, please, and that I hope to see her soon. Don't be disturbed about the licenses, for I hope in the Lord that everything will turn out very well. For Mother Prioress of San José of the Carmel in Seville.
1. Jesus be with your reverence, my daughter. I have written you a letter through the mail carrier. I believe it will arrive sooner than this one. Now I am sending off the crucifixes, which are no better or worse than the others. They only cost nine reales apiece, and I even think a cuartillo less. I have been told that they couldn't have been made for anything lower than a ducat. You will have to get a turner to make the holes. Since they brought them during the Easter feastdays I wasn't able to have this done, so I'm sending them as they are. It's more convenient. The crosses are made from ebony wood. They are not expensive, so I would have liked to send you even more.
2. I long for news about good Bernarda. I have already written to you of how God took a sister from this house to himself, which caused me deep grief.
3. In regard to your speaking to Garciálvarez about your prayer, there is no reason to stop, for there is nothing in it that",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,3,14,1,7,17,1,0,4,5,8,10,9,6,3,1,2,2,4,0,0
"649",1577,41,"needs correcting. And this is true also for those who proceed as you do. It would seem strange for you to desist, especially since this would not conform to what our Father Visitator requests. Give him my best regards.
4. Oh, how I would like to send my little book to the prior of Las Cuevas, who has asked for it. We owe him so much that I would like to please him in this way. And it wouldn't harm Garciálvarez to learn something about our procedure, especially in prayer. If the book were there I would give it to the prior, for we have no way of compensating this saint in the way he deserves, other than by doing what he asks of us. Perhaps this will be possible one day. It has been such a busy day for me that I cannot go on at greater length.
5. I have already written informing you that I received what the muleteer brought, although it didn't arrive in good condition. This is not a good time to send such things, because of the heat. Don't send me anything but the orange-flower water, for the flask broke. And if you can find any, send some crystalized orange blossoms, dry, and sprinkled with sugar, for I will pay for their cost. Otherwise send the sweets. But I prefer the orange blossoms, whatever the price, even if only a small quantity.
6. I've already told you that one of our nuns has gone to heaven, and about the trials we have had, and how delighted I am with the entrance of Nicolao. I greatly appreciate your solicitude for the nuns in Paterna, for they write to me about it. I think it was God's providence that someone with your charity and talents remained down there for the good of us all. I hope that these good qualities he will greatly increase in you.
7. I don't think I will be able to write to Father Prior of Las Cuevas. I'll do so another day. Don't let him know about these letters. My regards to all the nuns, especially Gabriela, to whom I would like to write. Oh, how I long to see that widow inside the monastery and professed. May God bring this about, and watch over you, amen. I also sent you a letter of Doña Luisa's. It's the last day of Easter.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
8. You should know that the brother of San Francisco was dismissed from the Society of Jesus, for",2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,2,0,6,12,0,3,17,0,0,1,10,5,14,13,4,5,0,1,0,0,0,2
"650",1577,42,"which I was sorry. I didn't dare write to her lest I cause her grief, but perhaps it would be better for her to learn of it from us. You will see from the enclosed page that I sought to have assurance of this through a friend of his in the Society who is in Salamanca; it contains what the prioress wrote me. I am happy that he has enough to eat. Perhaps he will be better off, even for God's service. If you think it wise, tell her, and send her these lines along with mine.
9. Padre Fray Bartolomé de Aguilar says that he would willingly speak to your community more often, but that he hasn't been asked, and that since he is subject to his superior he needs to be asked. Don't fail to invite him to preach some sermons, and invite him to visit you, for he is very good. You can certainly read the letters. Why not? 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. Yesterday Padre Fray Francisco de la Concepción arrived, who has been staying in Malagón. From the enclosed letter that our padre has written, you will see what a hurry he is in to receive a reply.
2. Juanico came beforehand and told me to expect Padre Fray Francisco who would be coming soon with Mother Prioress from Malagón. She has come to see if the doctors here might be able to cure her illness, for she has improved enough to travel, which is no small thing. A nun from here who is very good went in the meantime to preside at Malagón.
3. It seemed to me that it would not be good to send Fray Francisco to Madrid to wait for a message lest there be too many friars there bothering those blessed men. It's better that he wait here or in Malagón. If you order otherwise, he will go. But it's preferable that you make him stay here and send the message to him here, for this young messenger is trustworthy.
4. Our padre is right. But now I see that you can do no more, and so I wrote to him yesterday that I already knew that it would be almost useless to try to get Methuselah to hurry. Nevertheless, do all that you can, for goodness' sake, and write to me at length.
5. What do you think of the trial Señora Doña Luisa is undergoing? She and her daughter are very distressed. Pray for",1,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,0,8,1,6,17,1,1,3,6,4,11,11,3,4,2,0,0,2,0,1
"651",1577,43,"them, and remain with God, for I am very busy.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
6. My regards to Padre Padilla. The trials, as you know, have caused him so much suffering and left him in so painful a situation that he can be trusted to rise above this other affliction. For Mother Prioress, María de San José.
1. Jesus be with your reverence and reward you for so many nice gifts. Everything arrived safely and in good condition. I'll be writing more about this through the muleteer. Here I'll mention what is important.
2. I have felt envious of that angel. May God be praised that she was worthy to enjoy him so quickly, for I certainly do not doubt this. As for the rest, be assured that it was plain madness. Don't pay any attention to them or say anything about them, nor of what Beatriz said. I have greatly prized her charity. Give her my regards and thank her for me as well as her mother, and give my regards to all.
3. I am worried about that fever of yours and the subprioress's illness. Blessed be God who so wants to put us to the test this year and give you so many trials at the same time. And the worst is the poor health, for when one is in good health everything is bearable. Let me know as soon as possible how you are doing with your fever and also how the subprioress is. Please God the illness will not be as long-lasting as usual, for you are so few in number that I don't know how you will be able to get along. May God provide as he can, for I am worried.
4. In what you say about the burial, be assured that you did very well. Here we bury the nuns within the cloister, and so I must get our padre to make this a rule. The other practice is for nuns who are not bound to enclosure. Thus Padre Garciálvarez -- give him my regards -- was perfectly right, as he was also in holding that a priest may enter the enclosure for a reason like this. But no, it would be better in this regard that the priest be always Padre Garciálvarez. The monastery of the friars is so far away that I don't see how this could be done. I think Padre Garciálvarez is preferable since he is the nuns' ordinary confessor. I will take this matter up now with our padre and",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,17,2,8,22,3,1,1,9,9,5,8,9,1,3,1,0,8,0,0
"652",1577,44,"send you a license, for I will see him, God willing, before Pentecost. The nuncio has already sent for him, and it seems the negotiations are going well. Imagine how happy I am. He has gone to Caravaca and Beas.
5. I am sending you this letter from Alberta so that you will know how they are doing. We are still not finished with that monastery. Pray for them and for the nuns in Beas who are a cause of distress for me because of their lawsuits.
6. Yesterday I received your letter and found someone at once with whom to send it to our padre. While he is here I will repay you for the care you have taken in delivering mine to him. Accept the lay sister; please God she will be sufficient for you. I already told our padre that I would write you to accept her.
7. Regarding the renunciation of property of good Bernarda, keep in mind that since her parents are alive, the monastery does not receive the inheritance because it is the parents who are the heirs. If they had died before she did, the monastery would receive the inheritance. This is certain for I have consulted learned experts. Parents and grandparents are heirs by right. In their absence, the inheritance goes to the monastery. Their obligation is to give her a dowry, and if by chance they do not know this, they will praise God for the agreement you wish to come to with them. If they at least give the equivalent of what they promised in the guaranty to pay, it would be an excellent thing. See what you can do down there in this regard, for it would not be fitting for them to fail to give some dowry.
8. Padre Nicolao will know what the best thing to do is. Many regards to him, and to Padre Fray Gregorio as well, and anyone else you see, and remain with God. Although for some days my head has been much better, there is never a day in which I do not experience much noise in my head and it's very painful for me to write.
9. Mother Prioress from Malagón will be good company for me, but it grieves me to see her so ill without any hope of recovery, although there is great improvement. She eats better and is able to get up. But since the fever does not go away, we cannot pay too much attention to that, according to the",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,12,3,4,20,1,0,2,10,7,9,11,3,4,1,0,2,4,0,1
"653",1577,45,"doctor. God can do all things, and he could grant us this favor. Pray much that he do so. Since she is writing to you, I will say no more about her.
Today is 6 May.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
10. Give my special regards to Gabriela. I thoroughly enjoyed her letter and am happy that she is in good health. May God give this to all of you, as he can, amen, amen. For Padre Doctor Fray Mariano de San Benito in Madrid. 

Hand delivered.
1. Jesus be with your reverence and repay you for the good news you sent me; it seems to be in our favor for many reasons. The messenger boy left at once. May God direct everything for his own greater glory. This is what we are all aiming for and nothing else.
2. I am delighted that you are getting along so well with those Fathers, except that they do not fail to create difficulties. I have been told that Padre Fray Angel wrote to the Bishop of Salamanca not to give permission for the foundation and that they initiated a lawsuit as they did here, no more nor less. O mi padre! How poorly these negotiations are being handled. The foundation could have been already made had they known how to go about it properly. But things have only served to hurt the reputation of the discalced friars. Be assured that to take action at the wrong time never turns out well. On the other hand, I think what happened is part of God's plan and a great mystery. It will be revealed to us. If what you tell me gets done, everything will be settled. God reward you for the esteem you show for my opinion; may he be pleased that this continue. It seems to me you are receiving good advice where you are and that it's not necessary that you pay much heed to what I say. It is a great consolation to me that the negotiations are in such good hands. May he who does this be blessed, amen.
3. Why don't you ever say anything about Fray Baltasar? I don't know where he is. Give him my regards, and regards to Padre Padilla and Padre Juan Díaz. The prioress here and Brianda from Malagón ask for your prayers. After the latter came here she improved, but tonight she is worse. There is some hope that she will live. May God preserve her, and watch over you.
4. Take care, padre, to be",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,2,16,0,5,23,0,0,2,7,9,4,14,9,1,3,3,3,3,0,0
"654",1577,46,"on your guard, and don't grow careless about anything, for the friendships shown to you could be feigned. The true friend to whom we must pay heed is God, and if we try always to do his will there is nothing to fear. I would love to know what that response is, and I also wish that you and Father Master could stay in a place where you would be truly welcome. There is no lack of the cross in this life, however much we may do to escape it, if we belong to the party of the Crucified One.
5. In regard to Antonio Muñoz, he is mistaken, for Doña Catalina de Otálora is not one of our nuns, nor was she ever, but she is a widow who helped that foundation. But I don't believe she is there now, nor do I know her, nor would it be compatible with my religious profession to get involved with that matter. You may tell him this. In fact, I have felt a scruple about what I asked you in this respect. Since I do not know that gentleman well -- between you and me, although he is a close relative of hers, I've only seen him once -- I don't know what task would suit his soul. So I beg you not to pay any attention to my opinion in this matter, but act in accord with what you observe in his personality.
6. Don't say anything about this to him lest he become distressed, for I pity him. But give him my regards and say that I am not writing to him because of the bad condition my head is in, for it is still in a bad state. Tell him that I wrote to his wife, Doña Beatriz today and that the señora of whom he speaks is not a nun.
May God watch over you, for we need you, amen.
Today is 9 May.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with you, my daughter. I would much rather know that you are in good health than have all the gifts you are sending, although they are worthy of a queen. May our Lord reward you. The orange-flower water is nice, and there's an ample amount of it. It came just at the right time. I'm infinitely grateful. And the corporals are exquisitely done. It seems God inspired you because the prioress of Segovia has sent me a",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,14,0,7,15,2,0,1,11,5,15,12,7,3,3,1,1,2,1,1
"655",1577,47,"pall.When I was there, if I recall, I asked her to make one for me. It is all chain stitched with tiny pearls and garnets. They say the handwork alone is worth thirty ducats. And now we have the corporals made by Beatriz with the little cross -- more of them could have been added to fill up the box. The corporals are so lovely that I prefer them to everything else. The water arrived in good condition and now we have enough. It must have been you, as usual, who did the packing, for the things were well arranged.
2. I would want nothing more than to repay you in some way for what you sent me, for after all the gifts were a gesture of love. I have never in my life seen a place as dry as this when it comes to anything that tastes good. After my return from Seville, it seems to be even more sterile.
3. I have given orders here that the bill I owe for one hundred ducats to Asensio Galiano be paid now in Seville. I don't know if you remember that fifty ducats went to Mariano for the expenses of preparing that house for our arrival, and the other fifty were spent for the rent. For since Asensio has died, I have taken care to pay it, and I will not rest until I see you free of all these worries. The trials the Lord is giving you are enough. I am truly distressed over your illness and that of the subprioress, coming now at the beginning of summer. May God provide a remedy because I don't know what you are going to do.
4. I have already written by the mail carrier that you should take the lay sister and that the body of that little saint remain where it is, in the choir, for we must be buried within the enclosure and not in the church. I also wrote that since this saint's mother and father are living they become the heirs, even if she renounced these goods in favor of the monastery. If they had died before her, the monastery would have been the beneficiary. But they are obliged to give a suitable dowry. So, work things out as best you can. If he gave over the amount established in the guaranty, that would be great. But don't be having scruples about perfection, for however much we do they will say we are covetous. Well, you will have",3,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,9,7,3,3,15,2,0,1,7,5,14,9,10,2,3,1,1,3,1,2
"656",1577,48,"to follow whatever orders our padre gives. Write to him, and take good care of yourself, for me and for love of God.
5. I feel very sorry for Madre Brianda, although it seems she is better since she came. I greatly enjoy her company. Since she will be writing, according to what she has told me, I will say no more about her.
6. You will already have learned that the nuncio has sent for our padre. The negotiations seem to be going well. Pray for him. May His Majesty watch over you for me and make you very holy. I have been envious of the good Bernarda. We have prayed very much for her in these houses, although I don't believe she has need of it. Today is the vigil of the Ascension.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
7. My regards to Mother Subprioress and to Gabriela. Send me the recipe for the syrup that Sister Teresa was taking, for her father is asking for it. Don't in any way forget; it's what she took habitually during the day. For Mother Prioress in Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your reverence, my daughter, and I hope he gave you as joyous a Pentecost as I desired for you. Here we had a happy time with the arrival of our padre, who is on his way to Madrid, having been sent for by the nuncio. He looks healthy and well fed, blessed be God. You should know that it is necessary now to pray much for the affairs of the order and with great n ... and care, for the need is serious.
2. Tostado is already in Madrid. Four or five days ago he passed through here in such haste that he stayed no longer than three or four hours. Please the Lord that in everything he will do what is for God's greater honor and glory, for we desire nothing else. Pray that my head will get better for it is still in bad condition.
3. We have had poor luck with your cloth. They have shown it to half the houses and monasteries in Toledo but have not been able to sell it. Everybody thinks that four reales is too much to ask for it, but our conscience would not allow us to let it go for less. I don't know what we should do about it. Decide what you would like to do. May our Lord be with you.
The last day of Pentecost.
4. Our padre is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,2,18,0,4,21,0,1,0,9,4,9,9,4,2,1,1,1,1,1,1
"657",1577,49,"not here today, for he is preaching at the place where his sister is. He will not be able to write, because the mail carrier is departing.
5. I long to know how you and all the nuns are; some time has gone by since I've received a letter from you. May God watch over you for me. Madre Brianda is very sick and asks for prayers. I beg prayers from all of you and from Fray Gregorio, for now is the time in which we need the prayers of everyone.
6. Send this letter to him right away, and let everyone be on the watch because with the help of the Lord we shall see something good come about, or the opposite will happen. Never was there so much need for prayer. May God keep you.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus For Our Padre Maestro Gracián, Commissary Apostolic and Carmelite Visitator. In Madrid.
1. Jesus be with your paternity. Yesterday I received your letters. With the joy they brought me, I was repaid by the Lord for the pain caused me by the other letters, which were delivered by the same mail carrier who is going to deliver this letter. The nuns at the turn hadn't understood that he would return so quickly, and so there's no time for me to write at length.
2. I don't have time to write to Señora Doña Juana. Please God Señor Gracián's illness is not serious, for I was sorry to hear of it.
3. Today, the octave day of the feast of the Most Blessed Sacrament, Padre Fray Baltasar preached here. He says that in the house where he is residing the other friars are very disturbed about the foundation we are trying to make in Madrid. The matter about the excommunication frightened me.
4. I believe I will have to make use of a private messenger to send you the contracts for your signature, for I think they will be ready today.
5. My brother kisses your hands and asks me to tell you how necessary it is that you carry on very diligently in regard to the lawsuit over the excise. Give money to the procurator to send to the appropriate person so that the process can be concluded quickly and finished before August. This is necessary because of the grave hardship of which I spoke to you.
6. I was extremely pleased that your friend Elías is beginning to understand the reason. You should know that I went to much trouble there so that the prosecutor",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,16,1,7,10,2,0,1,8,13,4,7,6,3,3,1,1,3,1,0
"658",1577,50,"would understand her and I sent him word to tell you not to go, and I was successful. I don't know whether they gave you the letters. I cannot say more.
Your paternity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress in Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be in your reverence's soul, my daughter. I am deeply sorry that you have so many trials and that the fevers are continuing. But whoever wants to be a saint must suffer more.
2. Our padre sent me your letter written to him on the 10th of this month. My head is in a miserable state, and all of these days I've been worried about both your health and Mother Subprioress's, for I am very sorry about your illness. Madre Brianda is better at times and then her sickness returns.
3. As for my head, there has been some improvement in that some of the weakness is gone. I can write and use it more than usual. But the noise continues and is most unpleasant, and so I use a secretary, except for secret matters or when I am obliged for reasons of courtesy to write the letter myself. So, be patient in this regard as in all else.
4. I had written up to this point when my brother arrived. He sends you his best regards. I don't know if he will write to you. I mean Lorenzo. He is well, glory to God. He is going to Madrid on business. Oh, how sorry he has felt about your trials. I assure you that God truly wants you to be very holy. Take courage, for this period will be followed by another and you will be glad to have suffered.
5. As to whether the little slave girl should enter, by no means oppose it, for at the beginning in making these foundations many things are done that lie outside the general norm. You don't have to talk with her about perfection. It is enough that she serve well. The rest doesn't matter much for a lay sister. She could go her whole life without making profession if she is not meant for it. Her sister's situation is worse, but don't fail to receive her either and beg God to make her good. Don't be demanding with either of them as regards perfection. It's enough for them to carry out well the essentials. They owe you much and you rescued them out of great difficulty. Something has to be suffered. It is always",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,2,10,0,13,17,2,0,5,9,8,8,7,8,0,2,1,2,6,0,0

6. That other nun, if she is so good, take her. There's need for many nuns to replace those that die. The nuns go to heaven; don't grieve. I already see how you miss the good subprioress. We will try to get those in Paterna to return, once matters are settled.
7. Oh, what a letter I wrote you and Padre Fray Gregorio! Please God it will reach you. How I took you to task regarding your plan to move! I don't understand how you could even begin to speak about such a foolish thing.
8. Regards to him and to all my friends and my daughters. My brother has just arrived and I don't want to keep him waiting. May God watch over you carefully, for your illness grieves me more than anything. For goodness' sake take care of yourself and also my Gabriela. You should all wear linen and forget about austerity at a time when you are in such need. Here there is much sickness. My regards to all the nuns. May God preserve you for me, for I don't know how I can love you so much. Brianda sends her regards to you. Despite her illness, she is very good company for me. Today is 28 June.
9. Try to borrow money for food, for you can pay it back later. Don't go hungry, for that grieves me very much. We also try to do that here, and afterward God provides.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Do you think, mi padre, that in the houses I founded I had to adjust to only a few things that I didn't like? No, there were many things. One has to suffer something in order to accommodate a need like this. To the most illustrious Doña María de Mendoza, my lady.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your ladyship. Indeed, I have been very sad on this trip. I'm sorry to be so far away from that place. On top of all this, the lord bishop has written me that you are suffering a great trial, but he has not mentioned what it is. With such anxiety about you, I would have tried not to leave, had it not been the eve of my departure. I found help by entrusting the whole matter to our Lord. The thought came into my mind -- I don't know how -- that it has to do with some conflict the administrator caused my Lady Abbess.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,3,16,4,10,13,1,0,7,7,7,8,8,5,2,1,0,1,3,1,2
"660",1577,52,"This consoled me somewhat, for although a soul may be tried, God could be allowing this so as to enrich it. May His Majesty take care of the entire matter as I beseech him to.
2. I was most happy to learn that your health is much better. Oh, if you had the interior dominion that you have in exterior things, how little would all that we call trials here below matter to you. What I fear is the harm they do to your health. I beg you to write me -- there should be many messengers coming to this city -- and tell me in particular what the trouble was, for I am worried about it. I arrived here safely on the vigil of our Lady. Señora Doña Luisa was overjoyed. We spent a lot of time talking about you, which is a pleasure for me, for since she loves you so much she doesn't tire of this.
3. I tell you that the renown you have here is remarkable; may it please the Lord that your deeds will match it. They do nothing else but call you a saint and continually speak your praises to me. May the Lord be praised for your giving them such an example. In what way do you think it is given? In suffering so many trials. In this way the Lord, by means of the fire of love that he sets in your soul, begins to kindle it in others. So, be brave. Look at what the Lord suffered this time of year. Life is short, a mere moment of trial remains for us. O my Jesus, and how I offer to him the pain of my being separated from you and unable to know about your health as I would like!
4. My founding patrons here are very gracious. We are already seeking to get the license. I would like to proceed quickly, and if they give it to us promptly, I think everything will go well. I would like to speak of many things to my Señora Beatriz and to my ladies, the countesses. I often think of my angel Doña Leonor; may the Lord make her his servant. I beg you to give my greetings to Father Prior of San Pablo and to Father superior. The provincial of the Dominicans is preaching here. He has a large following, and rightly so; I have not yet spoken with him. May our Lord guide and preserve you for many years, amen.

Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite Señor Venegrilla:
Santos García brought ten bushels of wheat. Would you do me the favor of paying for the wheat, for I don't have the money. Señor Guzmán[2] will be pleased with this and will reimburse you, for that is what he usually does. 
Doña Teresa de Ahumada
Would you kindly send me some little pigeons. For Mother Prioress, María de San José.
1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. By the fact that you tell me you are somewhat better, it seems I am capable of bearing everything willingly. May it please the Lord that you continue to improve and may he repay the doctor, for I am dutifully grateful to him.
2. It's amazing that the subprioress is still alive. He who made her can easily give her health, for he gave her being from nothing. He is truly exercising her in suffering as he is all of you. Enduring something like this makes one ready for anything, even going to Guinea or beyond. Nonetheless, I would like to see it over with, for it causes me much grief.
3. Since I told Madre Brianda to write about what is happening here, I will only mention the things I need to. Neither the pictures intended for Doña Luisa nor the letter arrived, nor did you mention whether you received the cloth and the crucifixes. Let me know in the next letter and pray for Brianda, for I am happy to see her so much better.
4. Accept the nun gladly, for the dowry you say she has is not a bad one. I wish that that widow had already entered. The other day I wrote to you to take the little black girl gladly, for she will not do you any harm, and her sister as well. Neither did you mention whether you received that letter. I was sorry about Garciálvarez's illness. Don't forget to tell me how he is and whether your improvement is continuing. I received the coconuts; and they are something to behold. I will send them to Doña Luisa. The one for me is beautifully decorated. Our padre says he will break it open tomorrow.
5. Regarding Paterna, he says not to talk about it until he goes there -- we spoke to him a lot about that today -- for everyone would be disturbed at the thought that he is not the visitator, and he is right.
6. May God repay you for all the gifts you give me -- you must",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,3,7,2,6,21,1,0,2,4,6,7,15,6,4,4,0,0,5,0,0
"662",1577,54,"dream of being a queen -- and for even sending the portage. For goodness' sake take care of yourself and take it easy, for I would be receiving a great gift by your doing that. The sisters were delighted to see the coconuts, and I too. May he be blessed who created it, for it is certainly something to behold. It pleased me how with all your trials you have the vitality to think of things like this. The Lord well knows whom he gives trials to.
7. Just now I have spoken to our padre about the aspirant proposed by the archbishop. I am very displeased to see how persistent they are in their entreaties while he does not favor it. Our padre says that he thinks she is a melancholic beata -- and with such we should have learned our lesson -- and it would be worse to send her away afterward. Try to speak to her a few times to see what she is like. And if you see that she is not for us, it wouldn't seem to me a bad idea for Padre Nicolao to speak to the archbishop and tell him about the bad luck we have with these beatas; or try to delay the decision.
8. It has been a long while since I wrote the enclosed letter to Fray Gregorio and sent it to our padre to send on to him, and now he returned it to me. It's dated, but don't fail to read it so that the foolish temptation you've had to leave the house you are in doesn't return. I am sorry about the great trial you will have with that sister, and I pity the poor little soul for what she suffers. May God provide a remedy. Give everyone my regards. It would be a great consolation for me to see you, for I find few nuns so pleasing to me, and I love you greatly. The Lord can do all.
9. Best regards to Padre Garciálvarez and to Beatriz, her mother and the others, to whom I say that they need to be very perfect. The reason is that the Lord is beginning this foundation with them and has deprived them of their support. I don't know how you are able to manage everything. It's true that it would have been worse for you if you had to deal with calced nuns as was the case elsewhere. For, after all, your nuns will follow the path you point",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,1,1,9,0,11,23,0,0,5,11,7,9,8,7,5,5,0,0,0,1,0

Today is 11 July.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
10. Since our padre was here, he opened the package and gave me the letters, but kept the pictures and must have forgotten. I accidently found this out today, for he and Padre Antonio were arguing over them. I saw two and they were beautiful. 1. Jesús. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Our padre, Master Fray Jerónimo Gracián, spoke to me of his fondness for you and how much he trusts that without trouble you will do everything you can to help me; and that is no small thing since I have so many business matters to take care of. And so from now on I will turn to you with the letters destined for our padre, which is what matters the most to me. But this must be on the condition that you contribute no more than the effort involved, and in all simplicity we will take care of the postage; otherwise I would not want to accept your favor.
2. If there is any way in which I can be of assistance to you, I will do so gladly if I can. I beg you to send these letters to the parties they are addressed to.
Today is 14 July.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. ... If some friar should have to stay there, your paternity ought to advise him strongly not to spend much time talking to the nuns. Look, mi padre, this is very necessary. And I wouldn't even want the licentiate to do so, for even though he is so good, such goodness can give rise to bad judgments in people with malicious minds, especially in small towns, and everywhere else as well.
2. Believe me, the more you see that your daughters are cut off from such very special relationships, even though they are very holy ones, the better it is, even for the peace of the house. And I wouldn't want this to be forgotten ... 1. ... Antonio Gaytán has been here. He came to ask if his daughter could be received in Alba. She must be about the same age as my Isabelita. The nuns write me that she is especially amiable. Her father will provide food and afterward",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,3,9,0,5,20,0,2,0,3,3,17,9,8,4,1,0,0,2,0,1
"664",1577,56,"give all her disposable possessions, which they say amount to six or seven hundred ducats and even more. And what he does for that house and for the order is priceless.
2. I beg you not to fail to send me the permission, in your charity -- and quickly. I tell you these little angels edify us and are refreshing. With no more than one in each house, I don't see any obstacle but a benefit ... To the Most Illustrious and Most Reverend Señor Don Alvaro de Mendoza, Bishop of Avila, my lord, in Olmedo.
1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your lordship, amen. I have recovered from the illness I had, although not from the noise in my head, which always torments me. But just to know you are in good health I would willingly suffer greater ills.
2. I kiss your lordship's hands many times for the favor you show me by your letters, which are a great consolation for us. The nuns have also received their letters, and they have come and shown them to me feeling highly favored, and rightly so.
3. If you had seen how necessary it was for a visitation to be made by someone who knew how to explain the constitutions, and was also familiar with them through practice, I think you would have been very happy. And you would have realized what a great service you rendered to our Lord and all the good you did for this house by not leaving it under the power of someone incapable of recognizing the way in which the devil could begin to meddle, and indeed had begun to do so. Thus far no one was at fault since their intentions were all good. Indeed, I cannot thank God enough.
4. As for our needs, we will not suffer from any want. If in some need the bishop will not help the house, you should not be disturbed. The monasteries can come to the help of each other, which is better than their relying on someone who doesn't show the love for us that you have shown throughout your entire life. If only we had you here and could enjoy your presence -- and this is what makes us sad. As for the rest, it seems we have made no changes, for we are as always your subjects. And all the superiors will also be, especially Padre Gracián, who seems to have caught the love that we have for you.

"665",1577,57,"Today I sent him your letter, for he is not here. He went to Alcalá to dispatch those who are going to Rome. The sisters have been very happy with him. Indeed, he is a great servant of God. But for them it is also a real help to see that in everything he follows what you have set down.
6. In regard to that lady, I will try to do what you ask, if the occasion arises, for the person who informed me does not usually come to this house. But from what could be gathered the matter has nothing to do with a wedding. After reading your letter, I wonder if, in fact, it is about a wedding that someone was trying to prevent. I don't think, though, that the one with whom I spoke is zealous for anything else than God and the common good. May His Majesty guide matters for his greater service since things have already reached such a point that even if you do not so wish you will be involved. I am greatly consoled that you are free enough not to feel disturbed. Consider whether it wouldn't be good to warn the abbess and to show that you are very displeased with the party who intervened to see if that wouldn't be of some help. I tell you this was strongly recommended to me.
7. As for the matter concerning Maestro Daza, I don't know what to say, so great is my desire that you do something for him, for I see his good will toward you. Even if what you do amounts to little, I would be happy. He is so devoted to you, he says, that if he thought you found him bothersome by his asking for such favors he wouldn't stop serving you but try never to ask you for any favors. Since his devotion to you is so great and he sees that you are doing favors for others and have done so in the past, he is a little upset and thinks he is one of the unlucky ones.
8. With regard to the canonry, he is writing to you himself to explain. If he could be certain that you would favor him if some vacancy were to arise before you leave, he would be happy. And I would be happy because I believe this would be pleasing to God and to everyone -- and truly you owe it to him. Please God this will be possible so that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,2,4,0,3,23,2,1,0,11,3,20,19,7,4,3,1,0,0,0,0
"666",1577,58,"you will leave everyone satisfied. Even if it means something less than a canonry, I think he would accept it gladly. Well, not everyone has the detached love for you that your discalced nuns do, for all we want is that you love us and that God preserve you for us very many years.
9. My brother readily shares these sentiments. He is now in the parlor. He kisses your hands many times; and Teresa, your feet. We are all embarrassed that you ask again for prayers, for we would be offended to think that you do not know we are always praying for you. They are in a hurry for this letter, so I cannot go on any longer. I think that if you tell Maestro Daza that if a vacancy arises you will give it to him, he will be content.
Your lordship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be always with your lordship. The marriage of Señora Doña María made me very happy. Truly, despite my great joy, I could not completely believe it was happening. So it was a real relief for me to learn of it from your letter. May God be blessed for such a great favor, since these past days I have been anxious and worried longing to see you free of such a great concern. And it came about at so little cost to you, for I've been told that it is quite an honorable marriage. As for the rest, not everything can be perfect; it would have been much more troublesome had he been very young. Wives are treated much better by someone who is mature in age. This would be particularly true in the case of a wife who has as many reasons to be loved as she has. May it please the Lord that they have a happy life together, for I don't know what else could have given me so much pleasure at this time.
2. I have been distressed about Señora Doña María's illness. Please God, it will not be as serious as it usually is. Here we are taking more care than usual to pray for her.
3. May our Lord reward you for the alms. It came just at the right time, for we had no one to turn to, although I wasn't too worried. Francisco de Salcedo was more anxious than we were, for we always trust in God. The other day he told me that he wanted to write to you and only",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,15,0,10,30,6,1,1,10,3,11,11,11,1,0,1,2,2,4,0
"667",1577,59,"say in the letter, ""Lord, we have no bread."" I did not allow him, for my desire to see you free of debts is such that I would rather we suffer want than be the cause of an increase in your expenses. But since God gives you so much charity, I hope that His Majesty will provide for you in other ways. May he be pleased to preserve you for many years and bring me to a place where I might enjoy your company.
4. Padre Gracián is determined not to allow me to go to the Incarnation. But it is God whom I fear, even though nothing would be worse for us at present. I am delighted that you are being careful about your most generous nature and avoiding occasions like the festival. May it please God that this will be for your good and may he watch over you more than me.
Today is 6 September.
Your lordship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
5. Teresa kisses your hands and is doing what you ordered her to do; she would gladly go with you. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your majesty, amen. News has reached me that a memorandum was delivered to your majesty against Padre Maestro Gracián. I am astonished at the intrigues of the devil and these calced Fathers. They're not satisfied with defaming this servant of God (for he truly is and has so edified us that the monasteries he has visited always write to me about how he has left them with a new spirit), but they are striving now to discredit these monasteries where God is so well served. For this purpose they have made use of two discalced friars. The one had been a servant in these monasteries before becoming a friar and did things that made it obvious he often lacked good judgment. The friars of the cloth have availed themselves of this discalced friar and others antagonistic toward Padre Maestro Gracián -- for he is the one who must punish them -- and had them sign things that were absurd. I would laugh at what is said about the discalced nuns if I didn't fear the harm the devil can do with it, for in our communities such things would be horrendous.
2. For love of God I beg your majesty not to allow such infamous testimony to be presented to tribunals. The world is such that some suspicion can remain -- however well the opposite is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,20,0,12,26,5,2,1,4,10,12,9,5,2,2,1,1,0,2,1
"668",1577,60,"proven -- if we provide the opportunity. It is not helpful for the general reform that aspersions be cast on an order that by the goodness of God has been so well reformed. Your Majesty could, if you care to, acquaint yourself with this reality through some testimonies that were gathered by order of Padre Gracián. They concern certain facts about these monasteries taken from some serious and saintly persons who have dealings with these nuns.
3. Since the motives of those who wrote the memorandum can be investigated, consider, your majesty, for love of our Lord, that this matter is something concerning God's honor and glory. If those of the cloth see that you are paying attention to their testimonies, they will accuse the visitator of heresy to prevent any further visitations, and where there is little fear of God this will be easy to prove.
4. I feel sorry for all that this servant of God suffers, despite the rectitude and perfection with which he proceeds in everything. This obliges me to beg your majesty to favor him or give orders that he be removed from this situation so full of perils, for he is the son of parents who are in your majesty's service, besides his own good qualities. Truly, I think he is a man sent by God and his Blessed Mother. His devotion to her -- and it is great -- is what led him to the order and to helping me. For more than seventeen years I suffered alone from these Fathers of the cloth, and I no longer knew how to bear it; my own weak efforts were insufficient.
5. I beg your majesty to pardon me for being so lengthy. The great love I bear you has made me bold and I reflect that since the Lord puts up with my indiscreet complaints, you will also.
6. May it please him to hear all the prayers of the discalced friars and nuns that he preserve your majesty for many years, for we have no other support on earth.

Your majesty's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
7. I suspect that since Tostado will remain in his present position, the visitation will be of no benefit, but rather very harmful, especially since that preacher who was previously a calced friar, and about whose life I beg your majesty to inquire, has linked up with him. And if it is necessary, all of us discalced nuns will swear that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,16,0,9,25,1,0,3,13,8,7,10,12,1,1,1,0,2,2,0
"669",1577,61,"we never heard Padre Gracián speak a word -- nor did we see anything in him -- that was not edifying. And he was so extremely cautious about not entering the enclosure of the monasteries that even in conducting the chapters, when entering would seem unavoidable, he usually did so at the grille.

1. Jesus be with your honor always. Since these letters are of the greatest importance they are being sent with a much higher portage. I beg you to have them sent with the usual caution and quickly. If you cannot find a safe and trustworthy person, engage a private messenger and our padre will pay for it.
2. There are two packs of letters, for we had already sent one when another business matter arose, and this mail carrier would in no way let us add the later ones to the earlier ones, so it was necessary to make another pack. May the Lord guide them as the need requires, and may he watch over you for his greater service.
Written on 7 October.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
3. Let me know, for the love of the Lord, if there is anything new about the business matters, and pay a good portage.
4. It is very important that both packs of letters be delivered together to our padre and with all possible haste, as I have said. I kiss these ladies' hands. Fortunately there is the opportunity to do this. I'm saying nothing to Señor Juan de Ovalle because this letter is meant also for him.
I believe it's 23 July. Yesterday was the feast of the Magdalene. I have spoken with the Princess of Portugal many times and have been delighted, for she is a servant of God. ...
 1. Jesus be with your honor. Yesterday evening I received a letter from our Padre Gracián in which he tells me that the papal bulls for the Archbishop of Toledo have arrived. He believes the archbishop is already in Toledo, and that if he is there, he will be there in order to take possession of his see. Just now I have found this man, which I consider most fortunate. He says he will deliver the letter on Tuesday by noon. Today is Sunday, 19 October, I believe.

"670",1577,62,"he would have anything to ask of you. I gave the messenger three reales and I will give him another two here. When he is there give him two for his return, for we agreed on seven. I have some scruple about paying him everything here until I ask advice. Oh, what a trial these restraints of our poverty are! May it please the Lord -- since I can't do anything -- to provide for you in some other way, as he can.
3. I will have my letter ready so that you will not have to delay here, for it will be important for you to find the archbishop in Toledo. Yesterday I wrote again to Señora Doña Luisa that she not forget and to the prioress to keep reminding her. God willing, all these efforts and favors should be enough. Choose an animal that travels well and not some poor beast that's going to wear you out.
4. The nuns are without Mass, and there is nothing new, not even with regard to the other business matters, although they are proceeding well. Tell the prioress about this messenger in case she may want to write to me.
5. My sister may consider this as written for her too, and give my regards to Beatriz. Had we been seers, you could have left in time for Toledo by leaving from here, although the season is still good for travel. May the Lord take care of things, and since it's so late I'll say no more.

1. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Since I wrote at length through Diego Hernández two days ago, I believe, and the carrier of this letter is waiting, I will not be long. I am not writing to our padre, because I did so at that time.
2. I have a great desire to know what is happening with the poor nuns at the Incarnation ... It is something that will soon be found out.
3. You should know that the one whom they made prioress at the Incarnation has been anointed. And I feel sorry about the new trials that those poor nuns are suffering; over fifty of them have been deprived of active and passive voice, and as usual it is the provincial who will appoint the prioress, with only the votes of the other nuns.

Don't forget to inform Isabel López's relative. ... to see if there can't be some way to help these poor souls. I tell you that Joseph is right in letting him sleep. I am delighted, for from the time you left I begged for this with insistent prayers since it seems to me something necessary. And I almost believe that he is doing it for me -- in fact I do believe it -- since I begged for this so fervently. At least with that sleep the work will be bearable. Nonetheless, it seems to me that you are allowing yourself very little, for if you are going to Matins and getting up early, I don't know how you are getting enough sleep. 1. I take it as a very great favor from God that in the midst of so many storms Paul has the strength to make such great decisions. Just one hour of these troubles a month would be too much, for they present so many occasions for taking away one's peace. Glory be to the One who gives it.
2. If you carry out that promise, I will need nothing more for my consolation, for all other trials will finally come to an end. And if they did not, it would matter little. Tell him that I must keep that written document so as to remind him of its words should he not have it.
3. His willingness came just at the right time because of the fears I experience. My great anxiety is that Paul might stray in some way from the will of God. In this regard Joseph has greatly reassured Angela that he is doing well and continuing to merit more and more. To the very magnificent and reverend Señor Rodrigo de Aranda, in Madrid.
1. Jesús. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor, and may the Lord repay you, mi padre, for the consolation your letters give me. The favorable sentence given in the litigation has been a tremendous one for me. I thanked our Lord abundantly. I don't know if finding so much",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,9,0,3,20,2,0,0,10,9,12,17,5,1,0,0,3,0,0,0
"672",1577,64,"pleasure in a temporal matter speaks of much perfection. I believe your joy must have been very great and that I can extend congratulations to you, and so I do. Your absence at a time like this has made us feel alone. God willing, things will be smoothed over so that we won't need any favor from my lady, the marchioness, or any of your zealous efforts.
2. You should know, mi padre, that the nuns are in a situation that pains me very much -- I mean the nuns at the Incarnation. I strongly desire that they obey the present prioress as prioress; they do obey her but only as vicaress. Perhaps they are mistaken, but it seems to them that the well-being of that house depends on what has been done and that it will be destroyed because the friars will be going back there. So they say they want to wait as long as they can. For goodness' sake, would you find out if there is any way in which Tostado or the provincial could absolve them, or if the nuncio could intervene, for nothing is being done in the tribunal about it. If this situation were to go on for a long time, it would be hard to manage.
3. Would you speak about it also to Señor Licentiate Padilla and, if appropriate, write to Padre Julián de Avila, who is very influential with them, to see if perhaps he could get them to obey Doña Ana. For since the nuns know I don't want to go there, they pay little attention to what I say.
4. I beg my lady the marchioness to help in this matter in any way she can. If I saw the nuns were pacified, I would be greatly consoled. I am not writing to Señor Licentiate Padilla so as not to tire him, for he has trials enough; but I greatly desire to know what is happening concerning Tostado. Read these details about the nuns to the licentiate, I beg you, for things cannot go on as such and should have been resolved already. It is a great disturbance, and offenses against God will not be lacking.
5. May His Majesty watch over you. Your daughters commend themselves to your prayers.
Today is the vigil of St. Martin.
6. If after you have inquired into everything -- and after you have spoken with Señor Licentiate Padilla -- you cannot find a messenger who will come immediately, my lady the marchioness will send you one",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,8,0,6,10,1,2,1,12,7,24,23,3,3,5,3,0,2,0,0
"673",1577,65,"of hers. And if you see that doing that would prove troublesome, then hire a messenger and we will pay the expense here. It wouldn't do to prolong the waiting beyond next week; otherwise, as you can see in Fray Juan's enclosed note, the house will be in turmoil. And if you should hire a messenger, let Señor Licentiate Padilla and Señor Roque de Huerta know, for perhaps they may have some letters from our padre to send us.
May the Lord direct everything, for these things are painful to me, and may he watch over you.
Today is the vigil of St. Martin's feast.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
7. I am writing to the licentiate Señor Padilla, and so you need not speak of anything more than about how to proceed, for matters are such that there is no time for delay. Show him the enclosed note.  1. I praise our Lord highly that he is giving you this quiet and the desire to please him in everything, and that he enlightens you at times with such delightful understanding. This is all the work of his great mercy. Well, His Majesty must give the help that matches the trials, and since they are great, so also are the favors. May his name be blessed forever.
2. I tell you, mi padre, that it would be good for you to get your sleep. Realize that you have a great deal of work, and the tiredness is not felt until the head gets into such a condition that there is no remedy, and you already know how important your health is. In this matter follow the opinion of another, out of love of God, and when it is time to sleep set aside your projects, however necessary, and your prayer. Consider doing me this favor. When he sees this fervor of spirit, the devil often presents things as of great importance for God's service so that the good he cannot cut short by one extreme he does by another. I just read again the letter from Paul in which he says he is giving up sleep so as to work on his projects. And I think he says this in reference to his absorption in prayer. He shouldn't get into the habit of abandoning so great a treasure -- tell him this -- unless it involves giving up the sleep that the body needs. For the blessings the Lord gives in prayer are most remarkable, and I am not surprised that",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,10,2,1,2,15,0,6,24,1,1,1,10,3,11,15,7,4,4,1,6,3,1,0
"674",1577,66,"the devil would like to take them away. And since this favor cannot be received whenever one wants, it must be prized when God gives it. In a moment His Majesty will present to us better plans for serving him -- apart from so great a gain -- than the intellect could ever search out. And believe me, what I'm saying is the truth -- unless there is question of some important business matter that has to be concluded at the moment -- even if then the sleep does not come because of worries. And if sleep does come, there will be other times for thinking about what the fitting thing to do is. A book I once read says that if we leave God when he wants to be with us, we will not find him when we want to be with him. 1. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your majesty, amen. I strongly believe that our Lady has chosen you to protect and help her order. So, I cannot fail to have recourse to you regarding her affairs. For the love of our Lord, I beg you to pardon me for so much boldness.
2. I am sure your majesty has received news of how the nuns at the Incarnation tried to have me go there, thinking they would have some means to free themselves from the friars, who are certainly a great hindrance to the recollection and religious observance of the nuns. And the friars are entirely at fault for the lack of observance previously present in that house. The nuns are very much mistaken in their desire that I go there, for as long as they are subject to the friars as confessors and visitators, I would be of no help -- at least not of any lasting help. I always said this to the Dominican visitator, and he understood it well.
3. Since God allowed that situation to exist, I tried to provide a remedy and placed a discalced friar in a house next to them, along with a companion friar. He is so great a servant of our Lord that the nuns are truly edified, and this city is amazed by the remarkable amount of good he has done there, and so they consider him a saint; and in my opinion he is one and has been one all his life.
4. When the previous nuncio through a long report sent him by the inhabitants of the city was informed of the",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,2,2,16,0,5,21,1,0,1,13,6,14,8,9,0,3,0,2,1,1,0
"675",1577,67,"things that were happening and of the harm that the friars of the cloth were doing, he gave orders under pain of excommunication that the confessors be restored to their house (for the calced friars had driven them from the city heaping abuse on them and giving much scandal to everyone). And he also ordered that no friar of the cloth under pain of excommunication go to the Incarnation for business purposes, to say Mass, or hear confessions, but only the discalced friars and secular clergy. As a result, the house was in a good state until the nuncio died. Then the calced friars returned -- and so too the disturbance -- without demonstrating the grounds on which they could do so.
5. And now a friar who came to absolve the nuns caused such a disturbance without any concern for what is reasonable and just that the nuns are deeply afflicted and still bound by the same penalties as before, according to what I have been told. And worst of all he has taken from them their confessors. They say that he has been made vicar provincial, and this must be true because he is more capable than the others of making martyrs. And he is holding these confessors captive in his monastery after having forced his way into their cells and confiscating their papers.
6. The whole city is truly scandalized. He is not a prelate nor did he show any evidence of the authority on which these things were done, for these confessors are subject to the apostolic commissary. Those friars dared so much, even though this city is so close to where your majesty resides, that it doesn't seem they fear either justice or God. I feel very sad to see these confessors in the hands of those friars who for some days have been desiring to seize hold of them. I would consider the confessors better off if they were held by the Moors, who perhaps would show more compassion. And this one friar who is so great a servant of God is so weak from all that he has suffered that I fear for his life.
7. I beg your majesty for the love of our Lord to issue orders for them to set him free at once and that these poor discalced friars not be subjected to so much suffering by the friars of the cloth. The former do no more than suffer and keep silent and gain a great deal. But the people",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,3,15,1,14,10,4,1,4,11,8,6,8,5,1,4,2,1,4,1,0
"676",1577,68,"are scandalized by what is being done to them. This past summer in Toledo, without any reason, the same superior took as prisoner Fray Antonio de Jesús -- a holy and blessed man, who was the first discalced friar. They go about saying that with orders from Tostado they will destroy them all. May God be blessed! Those who were to be the means of removing offenses against God have become the cause of so many sins. And each day matters will get worse if your majesty does not provide us with some help. Otherwise, I don't know where things will end up, because we have no other help on earth.
8. May it please our Lord that for our sakes you live many years. I hope in him that he will grant us this favor. He is so alone, for there are few who look after his honor. All these servants of your majesty's, and I, ask this of him continually.
Dated in St. Joseph's in Avila, 4 December 1577.
Your majesty's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite To the very magnificent and most reverend lord and padre mio, in Granada.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor, mi padre. Today, the vigil of the Conception, I received a letter from you. May the Lord repay you for the consolation it gave me. This was necessary, for you should know that for more than three months, it seems, hosts of demons have joined against the discalced friars and nuns. They have stirred up so many persecutions and calumnies against us nuns as well as Padre Gracián, and these are so hard to stomach, that all we can do is take refuge in God. As a result, I believe he has heard our prayer, for the nuns are, after all, good souls. Those who sent memoranda to the king have retracted their words about the lovely exploits they attributed to us. The truth is a great thing and these sisters above all rejoice in it. As for me, it matters little. I've grown used to such things, and it's not surprising that they leave me untouched.
2. Now, to top things off, the nuns at the Incarnation have agreed to vote for me for prioress, and though I received fourteen or fifteen more votes than needed, the friars so conspired that another nun who had fewer votes was elected and confirmed. And the friars would have done me a great favor, provided everything had proceeded peacefully.
3. Since the nuns",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,0,5,20,0,2,1,8,7,5,11,8,1,2,1,1,0,0,0
"677",1577,69,"did not want to obey the newly-confirmed prioress except as vicaress, they were all excommunicated -- more than fifty of them. Although in fact, according to learned men, they were not really excommunicated, they have nonetheless had to undergo two months without being able to attend Mass or speak to their confessors, and they are in anguish. Although the nuncio has now given orders for them to be absolved, they are still in the same situation. Just think, what a life it is, to see all of this going on!
4. The case has now gone to the royal council. Although it is very troubling to see this, it's much preferable to my having to go there. Pray for me, for goodness' sake, for until we become a separate province I don't think we will ever have peace. The devil is trying to prevent this as much as he can.
5. Oh, if I could only speak to you to give you an account of so many things. What is happening and has happened is such a story that I don't know where it will end. When there is some news, I will write to you at length, for they tell me the letters are being delivered safely. It would have been a great help for me to know that you had such a friend in Madrid, but perhaps I still may look to benefit from his help.
6. I wrote to you at length from Toledo. You didn't tell me whether you received the letter. It wouldn't be surprising -- with my luck -- that you went there, now that I am here. Indeed, it would have meant a little comfort for my soul!
7. Peralta is very grateful to Carillo for what has been done for his relative, not because of concern for her, but because he ascertains that in everything his will is being done. If you should see him, tell him this and that, after all, in no friend does he find so much loyalty.
8. It truly seems that he arranged this friendship. Inform him that the matter written about from Toledo to that person was never resolved successfully. It is known for sure that the jewel is in his hands and that he praises it highly. So until he tires of it he will not give it over. He said that he wants to examine it carefully. It is said that if Señor Carillo were to come here he would see another which -- insofar as one",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,5,0,3,19,1,0,0,15,3,12,10,10,5,4,1,1,2,0,0
"678",1577,70,"can tell -- has many advantages over the previous one. It deals with nothing else but who he is; and it does so with more exquisite enameling and decoration. The jeweler did not know as much at that time, and the gold is of a finer quality, although the precious stones do not stand out as they did in the previous piece. It was done by order of the glassmaker, and that is evident according to what they say.
9. I don't know what got me into writing so much at length. I have always been fond of reaching my goal even when it's at a cost to me. Since he is a friend of yours, you will not tire of delivering these messages.
10. It is said also that one has not written to you through that person, because it would have been only a matter of courtesy and nothing more. Always tell whether you are in good health. I am happy to see that you are almost free of worry. That is not the case with me, but not knowing how, I am at peace and -- glory to God -- nothing takes it away from me. This noise in my head is distressing to me, for it is constant.
11. Don't forget to pray for me and this order, for there is great need. May His Majesty keep you as holy as I beg of him, amen.
12. These sisters send many regards. They are very good souls. All of us consider ourselves your daughters, especially I myself.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, amen. Mother Prioress has already written me of how everything was done, and others also have written. May our Lord be praised forever. I have been greatly consoled -- above all with the good news Mother Prioress tells me about Sister Isabel de los Angeles. May it please our Lord to watch over her and Sister San Francisco as well, with whom the community is also very happy.
2. It is no wonder that this caused a stir and aroused devotion. Because of our sins, the world is such that among those with the means to be well-off, as they think, only a few embrace the cross of our Lord; and it would be a much heavier burden for them to have to remain in the world. Here, too, from what I see, the news we received from up there will benefit us. I share in",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,15,0,4,21,2,0,0,7,6,3,6,8,3,3,1,2,2,1,0
"679",1577,71,"your happiness and that of Señora Doña María. Please remember me in your prayers.
3. It's clear she was in good company from the way she has understood the truth. As for the rest, certainly in anything that is of service to our Lord, the devil will try to use his power under the guise of many attractive colors. He has done a great deal here. In some way the nuns are right. They think that since they have to live on alms in these houses they would find themselves in trouble were others to see that the well-off take an interest in us. It may be possible to get along for a while, but soon the truth will be known. In sum, these are serious matters and an agreement cannot be reached so quickly. Glory be to the Lord since all has turned out so well. May it please His Majesty to give you all a long life to enjoy, and that you build a house for so great a King, for I hope in His Majesty that he will repay each of you with another house that will have no end.
4. I have received good news about Padre Fray Juan de Montalvo, although I have not seen a letter from him since I've arrived here. I thought he was up there. You are doing us a great favor by leaving the matter of the chaplain in such good hands. If the one of whom you speak has the required qualities, it matters little that he is young. May our Lord direct this as he has directed everything else.
5. As for the nuns, you are right; that is what is appropriate. For now, they must take no more than two. I am writing to Mother Prioress about this because our number should not exceed thirteen, and when these two enter, that number will have been reached. May His Majesty choose them and always protect you, amen. Would you please send these letters without delay to Mother Prioress.
Today is 18 October, the very day in which I received your letter.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus be with your honors. I don't have time to write. I only want to say that I am being very careful about that business matter. I wrote twice to Señora Doña Luisa, and now I am thinking of writing her again. It seems to me she is slow in responding. Certainly I have done and am doing all that I can.",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,1,11,0,5,25,0,0,0,9,5,7,10,11,3,2,1,1,3,0,0
"680",1577,72,"May God do what is best for your salvation, for that is what is important. There is no need to send her anything, for I fear that all may be lost. Rather, I am sorry about what you spent to go to Toledo, without any results that I can see. It wouldn't do any harm to send some gift to her brother, for after all he is the master, and nothing would be lost thereby. They are incapable of doing anything unless they think they are gaining something.
2. All gentlemen spend their winters in the country. I don't know why you are troubled about doing the same. Since you -- I mean my sister -- will have the company of Señora Doña Beatriz, to whom I send my best regards, I am not concerned. I am no worse than usual, and that's already good.
3. The nuns have been absolved, although they are still as insistent as before and bear a greater trial, for the discalced friars have been taken away from them. I don't know where it will end up, for it is really distressing to me. Those Fathers are carrying on as though out of their minds.
4. My brothers are well. They don't know about this letter, I mean this messenger, unless they found out from elsewhere. Teresa no longer has a fever, but the head cold continues.
May God be always with your honors.
Today is 10 December,
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be always with your reverence, my daughter. I received yours, and with it the potatoes, the keg, and seven lemons. Everything arrived in good condition. But the portage cost so much that there is no reason for you to be sending me anything any more; it's a matter of conscience.
2. A little over eight days ago I wrote to you by way of Madrid, and so I will not be long. There is nothing new as regards the business spoken of in that letter and about which we are very distressed. Although it's sixteen days from today that our two friars have been taken captive, we don't know if they have been released, although we trust in God that he will provide a remedy.
3. Since Christmas is now coming and since matters of justice cannot be handled until after the feast of Epiphany, the delay will amount to a long time for those who are suffering, if the matter hasn't been settled yet. And these nuns at the Incarnation are also very distressed, for",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,4,9,0,11,8,4,0,3,9,6,6,13,6,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
"681",1577,73,"they are in anguish over so many trials, and more so because these holy confessors have been removed and held under such constraint. For goodness' sake, pray for them all, for what they are suffering is a great pity.
4. I rejoice that you and all the sisters are well and that the good work Bernarda did for us has been discovered. Please God the widow will do what you said about not asking them for money. I wrote to the prior of Las Cuevas when I wrote to you. I sent the letter by way of Madrid, as I said. And since I don't know if this messenger is dependable, I'm saying no more.
5. My regards to Padre Garciálvarez and to Padre Fray Gregorio, whose letter -- with which I was delighted -- I am not answering for the reason I mentioned. I will try to see if anyone here knows that rector and have them write to him. Best regards to my Gabriela, whose letter was a delight for me. Regards to all the sisters and give Doña Leonor every best wish from me that you like, and let her know how consoling it is for me to learn of her great charity toward your house. And now that you may know how things stand, the portage for all that you sent me came to twelve reales. The package was very loosely bound; I don't know why.
Remain with God; may he give all of you as happy a Christmas as I want you to have.
Today is 19 December.
6. Teresa and all the nuns send their best regards. This head of mine is in a wretched state -- I don't know how you have understood it to be otherwise -- and so many trials have come together that at times I feel exhausted. I don't know when this letter will reach you or if this is a safe way to send it. My brother is well. Don't forget to remember me to all the nuns, and tell those from Paterna that I enjoyed their songs and that from what we can gather their hopes will soon prove vain and they will see this clearly. I give you permission to tell them all that you wish as coming from me.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
7. Note that I am seriously ordering you to obey Gabriela in whatever has to do with the treatment prescribed for you, just as I am ordering her to take care of you, for she",2,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,2,9,0,6,19,1,0,2,16,8,7,8,11,2,4,2,1,2,0,0
"682",1577,74,"sees how important your health is to us. I will answer that they should wait until summer. I have always desired to found a house there, for it would render great service to God. With such a dowry a house could be bought, for the sisters could be separated at a later time. To the very magnificent Señor Antonio de Soria, my lord.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor, amen. I received the one hundred reales and the rest of what the carrier of this letter brought. May the Lord preserve for many years the one who sent them and grant my prayer to give him health.
2. The carrier is bringing the bed, and if Señor Sotomayor is there, I beg you to tell him to examine it to see that no damage was done to it. I was present when it was packed in the cart and saw that the work was done carefully. I am sorry that this is such a lamentable place that I could not find what you asked me for anywhere. They took pains to try to find it -- as this good man will tell you -- and found no more than these three. Please God they will be what you want, for we were unable to make out one part of your letter in which you explain how they should be. Here we call the best kind camlet; any other kind is worthless. Certainly I have been wondering what I could send that you did not already have there, and I don't find anything worthwhile; if I could, it would make me very happy. But it would make me very happy if you informed me of some way I could serve you, without Señor Don Francisco knowing about it.
3. May our Lord ever guide your honor and make you very much his own.
Your servant,
Teresa of Jesus
I am sending seven pieces: two of green damask and five of gold fabric. I love them tenderly, and so I rejoice when you praise them and express your gratitude to me as though I were the one who had done something. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your most illustrious lordship, amen. I received your letter more than two months ago and I wanted so much to answer immediately, but I was waiting for some calm to return in the midst of the great trials that the discalced friars and nuns have been undergoing since August. I wanted",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,3,1,18,0,5,20,0,0,3,12,7,18,17,3,4,0,0,0,4,1,0
"683",1577,75,"to send you some news, as you requested in your letter, but was waiting before doing so. However, up to the present things have been getting worse by the day, as I will explain later.
2. Now there is nothing more I want than to see you, for I can only poorly describe in writing the happiness your letter -- which I received this week from Father Rector --  brought me. And this, even though I had received very clear news about you more than three weeks ago, and afterward the same news from another source. So I don't know how you could think that something of that sort would be kept secret. May it please the Divine Majesty that this redound to his greater honor and glory and help you grow very much in holiness, as I think it will. Believe that God will not fail to hear such fervent petitions made by souls who in their prayers desire nothing more than that he be served. And I, although miserable, pray continually for this, and so do all these servants of yours in all these monasteries. Each day I find in them souls that certainly put me to shame. It definitely seems that our Lord himself is choosing them, bringing them to these houses from places where I do not know how they could have heard of us.
3. You must take heart and not even let the thought cross your mind that this was not ordained by God -- I am certain it was. His Majesty is now giving you the chance to put into practice the desire you have had to serve him. You have been idle for a long time and our Lord is in great need of someone who will favor virtue. We poor and lowly people, however much we want only what is for his service, can do little if God does not awaken someone to defend us. And so he chooses one who he knows can help him. For malice has reached such a point, and ambition and the pursuit of honor have been so canonized by many of those who should have trampled them underfoot, that even the Lord himself seems to want the help of his creatures, although he is powerful enough for virtue to win the victory without them. Since those he has selected to defend virtue disappoint him, he has chosen those he knows can help him.
4. Strive to spend yourself in this work, as I know you",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,3,12,0,6,16,2,0,4,16,5,12,10,7,1,2,0,1,0,0,0
"684",1577,76,"will. God will give you the strength and health -- I hope for this from His Majesty -- and grace to succeed in everything. Here we will serve you by begging him unceasingly. And may it please the Lord to give you helpers interested in the good of souls so that you can go on without worry. I am greatly consoled that you can count so much on the Society; they are a wonderful help in everything.
5. The happy outcome for my lady the Marchioness of Elche brought me much joy, for that affair caused me a good deal of distress and worry until I learned of how well things turned out. May God be praised. As often as the Lord gives such a multiplicity of trials together, he usually causes good results. Since he knows we are so weak and does everything for our good, he measures out suffering in conformity with our strength. I think these storms that are lasting so long have to happen to us. If I were not certain that these discalced friars and nuns are striving to keep their rule in uprightness and truth, I would sometimes fear that the calced friars might succeed -- considering the devil's wiles -- in achieving their goal, which is to put an end to this beginning that the Blessed Virgin has initiated. God has given the devil the leeway to work toward this end.
6. Great effort and many plans have gone into discrediting us, especially Padre Gracián and me, the ones at whom they strike. I tell you that they have spread so many calumnies against this man and sent so many accusations to the king, very serious ones (and about these monasteries of discalced nuns), that you would be shocked if you knew about them and that they could invent so much evil. To my mind we have gained a great deal through all of this. The nuns go about so joyful that the matter doesn't even seem to touch them. Padre Gracián bears everything with such perfection that I am amazed. God has stored a great treasure in that soul, for he prays especially for his accusers and has borne their calumnies with the joy of a St. Jerome.
7. Only the matters that involved the discalced nuns caused him distress. Since for two years he has been their visitator and knows them, he cannot bear what is said; he considers them angels, and this is what he calls them. God was pleased that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,20,0,12,32,5,1,1,8,8,6,10,8,0,1,1,0,2,1,0
"685",1577,77,"the things said against us were retracted by those who said them. As for the other things said about Padre Gracián, an inquiry was made by order of the council and the truth became known. Other things, too, were retracted, and the prejudice spreading through Madrid was recognized. Believe me, the devil was trying to get rid of the good that these houses are doing.
8. Now, besides what was done against these poor nuns at the Incarnation who, to pay for their sins, elected me as prioress (that is, judicial proceedings were initiated), the whole city is shocked by what they have suffered and are suffering. And I still do not know when it will all end. Padre Tostado's severity toward them has been unusual. For more than fifty days he has refused to allow them to hear Mass, and for three months now they have not been allowed to see anyone. He has been saying daily, with great threats, that they are excommunicated, but all the theologians in Avila deny this. The excommunication warning was directed toward preventing them from electing anyone outside the house. With a statement like that, no mention had to be made of me. The nuns thought that since I was a professed nun from that house and had lived so many years in it, they did not need to consider me as someone outside the house. In fact, if I wanted to return to that house, I could, for my dowry is there and I do not belong to a different province. Another nun who had less than a majority of votes was confirmed in the office of prioress. Those being punished have appealed their case to the royal council. I don't know how it will end.
9. It hurts me deeply to witness so much disturbance and scandal in the city on my account and so many anxious souls, for there were more than fifty-four nuns excommunicated. My only consolation was that I did all I could to prevent the nuns from electing me. And I guarantee you that one of the greatest trials that could come to me on this earth would be to see myself at the Incarnation. I didn't have an hour of good health all the time I was there.
10. I greatly pity those souls. Among them are nuns who have attained great perfection, and this is evident in the way they have borne their trials. Yet what has most distressed me is that the two discalced friars",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,3,12,0,13,8,3,3,4,10,6,8,5,9,2,5,0,0,1,0,0
"686",1577,78,"who were confessors there have been held captive more than a month by those of the cloth, under orders from Padre Tostado. The two are excellent religious and have edified the entire city during their five years there. Because of their presence the house has remained in the state it was when I left it. One of them, at least, whose name is Fray John of the Cross, is considered a saint by everyone, men and women alike, and I don't think they exaggerate. In my opinion, he is a gem. Since they were appointed to that position by both the Dominican apostolic visitator and the previous nuncio and were subject to the visitator Gracián, what was done is so absurd it is frightening. I don't know where it will end. What pains me is that they have been taken away and we don't know where. Moreover it is feared that they are being treated harshly, and I'm afraid something unfortunate will happen. A protest about this has also gone to the royal council. May God provide a remedy.
11. Pardon me for going on at such length, but it is gratifying to me that if Padre Tostado goes there you know the truth about what is happening. The nuncio favored him very much as soon as he arrived and told Padre Gracián to stop making visitations. This does not take away Gracián's appointment as apostolic commissary, for the nuncio did not show his faculties nor, according to what Gracián says, take Gracián's away. Nonetheless, Gracián went immediately to Alcalá, and lived in a cave there as he did in Pastrana, suffering, as I said, abominable calumnies. He no longer exercises his position as commissary, but he stays there and has suspended all activity. His great desire is to be free of having to make any more visitations. This is what we all want, for they are the cause of many troubles for us -- unless God gives us the grace to form a separate province; otherwise I don't know where things will end. On arriving there he wrote to me that if Padre Tostado makes a visitation, he is determined to obey him and that all of us nuns should do so too.
12. Padre Tostado did not go there, nor has he come here. I think the Lord prevented this, for with the bad will he later showed, I believe it would have been very harmful for us. Nonetheless, those of the cloth say that Padre Gracián is",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,1,1,7,0,10,15,3,1,1,10,7,6,6,5,0,3,0,0,2,0,0
"687",1577,79,"directing everything and preparing to make a visitation, which is what is killing us. Truly no other reason lies behind this than the one I have told you. In a certain way I have found rest in the thought that you know this whole story, although you may not find reading it so restful since you feel most obliged to favor this order. I also wanted you to be aware of the obstacles that stand in the way of your desire that we come to Portugal, and others exist as well that I'll now mention, which cause us another embroilment.
13. Since I cannot but strive in every possible way to prevent the ruin of this good beginning, nor has any learned confessor of mine counseled me otherwise, these calced Fathers are very displeased with me and have informed our Father General so that he convened a general chapter, which has taken place. This chapter ordained, and our Father General gave the orders, that no discalced nun could leave her house, and especially that I should choose a house to my liking and remain there under pain of excommunication.
14. Clearly the purpose is to prevent any more foundations of nuns. It is a pity to see how many are crying out to enter these monasteries, which are so few, and that no more requests can be accepted. Although the previous nuncio, after all that I mentioned, gave me orders not to stop making foundations, and I have ample patent letters from the visitators to make them, I am very determined not to do so unless either our Father General or the pope ordains otherwise. Since nothing of this comes through my fault, I see it as a favor from God, for I was already very tired out. Nevertheless, to be of service to you would mean nothing but rest for me -- it's hard to think of not being able to see you again -- and were I given the command to undertake such a service, it would bring me great consolation. But even if this decision of the general chapter had not been made, the patent letters I received from the general were valid only for the kingdoms of Castile. A new mandate would be necessary.
15. I am certain that for now our Father General would not give it. Getting the approval of the pope would be easy, though, especially if he saw the document prepared by order of Padre Gracián about how life is lived in these",2,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,2,0,7,1,7,13,0,2,3,16,14,11,8,8,4,0,2,0,3,0,0
"688",1577,80,"monasteries, and the benefit that others receive in places where these are found. So great is the benefit that it is said, even by serious-minded people, that this alone would be enough to canonize the nuns. Because I fear it may say too many good things about me, I have not read it. But I would want authorization from Father General before making the foundation and that he be asked to approve of our continuing to make foundations in Spain, for there are nuns who could do this without my going out to do so. I mean that once the house is ready the nuns could be sent there, for souls are being deprived of much benefit. If you are acquainted with the protector of our order, who they say is the pope's nephew, he could obtain the permission from our Father General. I think you would be rendering a great service to our Lord and doing this order a great favor if you obtained it.
16. There is another drawback -- I want you to be informed about everything -- which is that Padre Tostado has already been accepted as vicar general for the kingdom of Portugal, and it would be most unpleasant, especially for me, to fall into his hands. I think he would make every effort to block a foundation. In Castile, it now seems, he doesn't have such power. Since he exercised his office without first having shown his faculties (especially in regard to the problems at the Incarnation, which made a bad impression), he was ordered by royal decree to hand over his faculties to the royal council -- he had received another notification last summer -- and they have not returned them to him, nor do I think they will.
17. We also have letters from the apostolic visitators that in these monasteries the official visitator must receive the task from Father General and be a discalced friar. With nothing like this happening there in Portugal, we would be subject to ""those of the cloth,"" and perfection would soon go crashing to the ground. Here they were beginning to do us much harm, but the apostolic commissaries came along. You can consider what the remedy might be for all these obstacles, for there will be no lack of good nuns ready to serve you. Padre Julián de Avila, who already seems set to start on the road, kisses your hands. He is very happy with the news about your appointment. He already knew about",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,1,0,9,0,7,17,1,0,2,11,9,17,7,5,0,3,3,3,1,1,0
"689",1577,81,"it since I had told him before. He is very confident that you will gain much in the sight of the Lord because of your care for this new foundation.
18. María de San Jerónimo, who is the one who was subprioress in this house, also kisses your hands. She says she would be eager to go to serve you, if our Lord so ordains. May His Majesty guide everything for his glory and watch over you with a great increase of his love.
19. It is no surprise that now in the midst of such news you cannot enjoy the recollection you desire. Our Lord will give you a double measure as he usually does when recollection is set aside for his service, although I do desire that you procure some time for yourself, for in this lies all our good.
From this house of St. Joseph's in Avila, 16 January.
I beg you, for the love of our Lord, not to torment me with those titles.
Your most illustrious lordship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Once while I was experiencing great distress over having offended God, He said to me: ""All your sins are before me as though they were not; in the future make every effort, for your trials are not over."" 1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, amen. I have come here to proceed at once toward getting these sisters settled. I don't have much time and because of this and also because the desirable season for constructing walls is nearly over, I was sorry not to find you here. The license from the king has arrived, and it's necessary to have it verified at once.
2. I beg you please to come quickly; since the matter is so important, I hope in God that you will not become irritated with me. May the Lord guide everything for his greater service and may he always lead you by the hand.
3. The house seems good to me, although more than 500 ducats will be necessary before entering it. Nonetheless, I am pleased and I hope in our Lord that you will be pleased in seeing it put to such good use. May the Lord grant you many years. Remember, the work has to begin during the good season and so it's a pity to see these days wasted.
4. For the love of God do us the favor of coming at once. And if you delay, I beg you to agree to",2,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,17,0,7,26,2,2,1,6,9,8,14,10,4,2,2,2,0,4,0
"690",1577,82,"our beginning to make the partition walls, for more than two hundred are needed; this will do no harm to the house. If afterward the agreement is not finalized (which is why I hope in God you will come quickly), the loss will be ours.
5. When you arrive, everything can be worked out. May His Majesty give you a long life so that you may ever gain more merit for eternal life.
Today is 2 August.
Your honor's unworthy servant, who kisses your hands,
Unworthy,
Teresa of Jesus 1. While at St. Joseph's in Avila, on the vigil of Pentecost, I was in the hermitage of Nazareth reflecting upon a very great favor our Lord had granted me on that day, more or less twenty years before, when an intense spiritual impulse and fervor began which caused my faculties to be suspended. In this great recollection I heard from our Lord the following:
That I should tell the Discalced Fathers that for their part they ought to strive to observe four things and that as long as they keep them their religious order will grow, and that when they fail to do so they will be falling away from their original purpose. The first is that their leaders be in accord. The second, that though they have many houses, there be few friars in each. The third, that they speak little with seculars, but that when they do, it be for the good of these persons' souls. The fourth, that they teach by works more than by words.
This happened in the year 1579. And because it is very true, I sign it with my name.
Teresa of Jesus. THE SECOND DWELLING PLACE
 
This Section Has Only One Chapter
CHAPTER 1
 
Discusses the importance of perseverance if one is to reach the final dwelling places; the great war the devil wages; and the importance of taking the right road from the beginning. Offers a remedy that has proved very efficacious.
 
1. Now let us speak about the type of soul that enters the second dwelling places and what such a soul does in them. I'd like to say only a little, for I have spoken at length on this subject elsewhere. And it would be impossible to avoid repeating much of it, for I don't remember a thing of what I said. If I could present the matter for you in a variety of ways I know well that you wouldn't be annoyed since we never tire of books -- as many as there are --",3,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,10,1,2,1,12,1,10,16,4,2,2,5,7,11,7,5,0,6,1,1,3,1,0
"691",1577,83,"that deal with it.
2. This stage pertains to those who have already begun to practice prayer and have understood how important it is not to stay in the first dwelling places. But they still don't have the determination to remain in this second stage without turning back, for they don't avoid the occasion of sin. This failure to avoid these occasions is quite dangerous. But these persons have received a good deal of mercy in that they sometimes do strive to escape from snakes and poisonous creatures, and they understand that it is good to avoid them.
These rooms, in part, involve much more effort then do the first, even though there is not as much danger, for it now seems that souls in them recognize the dangers, and there is great hope they will enter further into the castle. I say that these rooms involve more effort because those who are in the first dwelling places are like deaf-mutes and thus the difficulty of not speaking is more easily endured by them than it is by those who hear but cannot speak. Yet, not for this reason does one have greater desire to be deaf, for after all it is a wonderful thing to hear what is being said to us. So these persons are able to hear the Lord when He calls. Since they are getting closer to where His Majesty dwells, He is a very good neighbor. His mercy and goodness are so bountiful; whereas we are occupied in our pastimes, business affairs, pleasures, and worldly buying and selling, and still falling into sin and rising again. These beasts are so poisonous and their presence so dangerous and noisy that it would be a wonder if we kept from stumbling and falling over them. Yet this Lord desires intensely that we love Him and seek His company, so much so that from time to time He calls us to draw near Him. And His voice is so sweet the poor soul dissolves at not doing immediately what He commands. Thus, as I say, hearing His voice is a greater trial than not hearing it.
3. I don't mean that these appeals and calls are like the ones I shall speak of later on. But they come through words spoken by other good people, or through sermons, or through what is read in good books, or through the many things that are heard and by which God calls, or through illnesses and trials, or also through a truth",2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,3,4,10,0,16,18,6,6,1,8,6,5,11,2,0,18,0,0,5,1,0
"692",1577,84,"that He teaches during the brief moments we spend in prayer; however lukewarm these moments may be, God esteems them highly. And you, Sisters, don't under-estimate this first favor, nor should you become disconsolate if you don't respond at once to the Lord. His Majesty knows well how to wait many days and years, especially when He sees perseverance and good desires. This perseverance is most necessary here. One always gains much through perseverance. But the attacks made by devils in a thousand ways afflict the soul more in these rooms than in the previous ones. In the previous ones the soul was deaf and dumb -- at least it heard very little and resisted less, as one who has partly lost hope of conquering. Here the intellect is more alive and the faculties more skilled. The blows from the artillery strike in such a way that the soul cannot fail to hear. It is in this stage that the devils represent these snakes (worldly things) and the temporal pleasures of the present as though almost eternal. They bring to mind the esteem one has in the world, one's friends and relatives, one's health (when there's thought of penitential practices, for the soul that enters this dwelling place always begins wanting to practice some penance) and a thousand other obstacles.
4. O Jesus, what an uproar the devils instigate here! And the afflictions of the poor soul: it doesn't know whether to continue or to return to the first room. Reason, for its part, shows the soul that it is mistaken in thinking that these things of the world are not worth anything when compared to what it is aiming after. Faith, however, teaches it about where it will find fulfillment. The memory shows it where all these things end, holding before it the death of those who found great joy in them. Through the memory it sees how some have suffered sudden death, how quickly they are forgotten by all. Some whom it had known in great prosperity are under the ground, and their graves are walked upon. This soul itself has often passed by these graves. It reflects that many worms are swarming over the corpses, and thinks about numerous other things. The will is inclined to love after seeing such countless signs of love; it would want to repay something; it especially keeps in mind how this true Lover never leaves it, accompanying it and giving it life and being. Then the intellect helps it realize",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,2,3,16,6,12,18,1,2,5,14,6,8,14,7,3,3,0,0,4,3,0
"693",1577,85,"that it couldn't find a better friend, even were it to live for many years, that the whole world is filled with falsehood, and that so too these joys the devil gives it are filled with trials, cares, and contradictions. The intellect tells the soul of its certainty that outside this castle neither security nor peace will be found, that it should avoid going about to strange houses since its own is so filled with blessings to be enjoyed if it wants. The intellect will ask who it is that finds everything he needs in his own house and, especially, has a guest who will make him lord over all goods provided that he wills to avoid going astray like the prodigal son and eating the husks of swine.
5. These are reasons for conquering the devils. But, oh, my Lord and my God, how the whole world's habit of getting involved in vanities vitiates everything! Our faith is so dead that we desire what we see more than what faith tells us. And, indeed, we see only a lot of misfortune in those who go after these visible vanities. But these poisonous things we are dealing with are the cause of this misfortune, for just as all is poisoned if a viper bites someone and the wound swells, so we will be poisoned if we do not watch ourselves. Clearly many remedies are necessary to cure us, and God is favoring us a good deal if we do not die from the wound. Certainly the soul undergoes great trials here. If the devil, especially, realizes that it has all it needs in its temperament and habits to advance far, he will gather all hell together to make the soul go back outside.
6. Ah, my Lord! Your help is necessary here; without it one can do nothing. In Your mercy do not consent to allow this soul to suffer deception and give up what was begun. Enlighten it that it may see how all its good is within this castle and that it may turn away from bad companions. It's a wonderful thing for a person to talk to those who speak about this interior castle, to draw near not only to those seen to be in these rooms where he is but to those known to have entered the ones closer to the center. Conversation with these latter will be a great help to him, and he can converse so much with them that they will bring him",3,5,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,17,2,13,21,2,5,1,7,8,11,9,13,5,1,0,0,5,0,1
"694",1577,86,"to where they are. Let the soul always heed the warning not to be conquered. If the devil sees that it has the strong determination to lose its life and repose and all that he offers it rather than return to the first room, he will abandon it much more quickly. Let the soul be manly and not like those soldiers who knelt down to drink before going into battle (I don't remember with whom), but be determined to fight with all the devils and realize that there are no better weapons than those of the cross.
7. Even though I've said this at other times, it's so important that I repeat it here: it is that souls shouldn't be thinking about consolations at this beginning stage. It would be a very poor way to start building so precious and great an edifice. If the foundation is on sand, the whole building will fall to the ground. They'll never finish being dissatisfied and tempted. These are not the dwelling places where it rains manna; those lie further ahead, where a soul finds in the manna every taste it desires; for it wants only what God wants. It's an amusing thing that even though we still have a thousand impediments and imperfections and our virtues have hardly begun to grow -- and please God they may have begun -- we are yet not ashamed to seek spiritual delights in prayer or to complain about dryness. May this never happen to you, Sisters. Embrace the cross your Spouse has carried and understand that this must be your task. Let the one who can do so, suffer more for Him; and she will be rewarded that much more. As for other favors, if the Lord should grant you one, thank Him for it as you would for something freely added on.
8. It will seem to you that you are truly determined to undergo exterior trials, provided that God favors you interiorly. His Majesty knows best what is suitable for us. There's no need for us to be advising Him about what He should give us, for He can rightly tell us that we don't know what we're asking for. The whole aim of any person who is beginning prayer -- and don't forget this, because it's very very important -- should be that he work and prepare himself with determination and every possible effort to bring his will into conformity with God's will. Be certain that, as I shall say later, the",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,14,0,12,23,2,3,4,12,2,15,11,10,1,2,2,0,1,0,2
"695",1577,87,"greatest perfection attainable along the spiritual path lies in this conformity. It is the person who lives in more perfect conformity who will receive more from the Lord and be more advanced on this road. Don't think that in what concerns perfection there is some mystery or things unknown or still to be understood, for in perfect conformity to God's will lies all our good. Now then, if we err in the beginning, desiring that the Lord do our will at once and lead us according to what we imagine, what kind of stability will this edifice have? Let us strive to do what lies in our power and guard ourselves against these poisonous little reptiles, for the Lord often desires that dryness and bad thoughts afflict and pursue us without our being able to get rid of them. Sometimes He even permits these reptiles to bite us so that afterward we may know how to guard ourselves better and that He may prove whether we are greatly grieved by having offended Him.
9. Thus, if you should at times fall don't become discouraged and stop striving to advance. For even from this fall God will draw out good, as does the seller of an antidote who drinks some poison in order to test whether his antidote is effective. Even if we didn't see our misery -- or the great harm that a dissipated life does to us -- through any other means than through this assault that we endure for the sake of being brought back to recollection, that would be enough. Can there be an evil greater than that of being ill at ease in our own house? What hope can we have of finding rest outside of ourselves if we cannot be at rest within. We have so many great and true friends and relatives (which are our faculties) with whom we must always live, even though we may not want to. But from what we feel, these seem to be warring against us because of what our vices have done to them. Peace, peace, the Lord said, my Sisters; and He urged His apostle so many times. Well, believe me, if we don't obtain and have peace in our own house we'll not find it outside. Let this war be ended. Through the blood He shed for us I ask those who have not begun to enter within themselves to do so; and those who have begun, not to let the war make them turn",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,7,3,16,17,1,11,3,15,7,12,20,9,1,1,2,1,4,0,1
"696",1577,88,"back. Let these latter reflect that a relapse is worse than a fall; they already see their loss. Let them trust in the mercy of God and not at all in themselves, and they will see how His Majesty brings them from the dwelling places of one stage to those of another and settles them in a land where these wild animals cannot touch or tire them, but where they themselves will bring all these animals into subjection and scoff at them. And they shall enjoy many more blessings than one can desire -- blessings even in this life, I mean.
10. Since, as I've said in the beginning, I've written to you about how you should conduct yourselves in these disturbances set up here by the devil and how you cannot begin to recollect yourselves by force but only by gentleness, if your recollection is going to be continual, I will not say anything else here than that in my opinion it is very important to consult persons with experience; for you will be thinking that you are seriously failing to do some necessary thing. Provided that we don't give up, the Lord will guide everything for our benefit, even though we may not find someone to teach us. There is no other remedy for this evil of giving up prayer than to begin again; otherwise the soul will gradually lose more each day -- and please God that it will understand this fact.
11. Someone could think that if turning back is so bad it would be better never to begin but to remain outside the castle. I have already told you at the beginning -- and the Lord Himself tells you -- that anyone who walks in danger perishes in it and that the door of entry to this castle is prayer. Well now, it is foolish to think that we will enter heaven without entering into ourselves, coming to know ourselves, reflecting on our misery and what we owe God, and begging Him often for mercy. The Lord Himself says: No one will ascend to My Father but through Me (I don't know if He says it this way -- I think He does) and whoever sees Me sees My Father. Well, if we never look at Him or reflect on what we owe Him and the death He suffered for us, I don't know how we'll be able to know Him or do works in His service. And what value can faith have without works",2,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1,4,16,1,14,14,3,2,5,16,6,8,15,7,5,4,1,0,2,0,0
"697",1577,89,"and without joining them to the merits of Jesus Christ, our Good? Or who will awaken us to love this Lord?
May it please His Majesty to give us understanding of how much we cost Him, of how the servant is no greater than his master, and that we must work in order to enjoy His glory. And we need to pray for this understanding so that we aren't always entering into temptation. THE THIRD DWELLING PLACES
 
Contains Two Chapters
CHAPTER 1
 
Treats of what little security we can have while living in this exile, even though we may have reached a high state, and of how we should walk with fear. This chapter has some good points.
 
1. What shall we say to those who through perseverance and the mercy of God have won these battles and have entered the rooms of the third stage, if not: Blessed is the man who fears the Lord?  His Majesty has done no small thing in giving me understanding right now of what this verse means in the vernacular, for I am ignorant in matters like this. Certainly we are right in calling such a man blessed, since if he doesn't turn back he is, from what we can understand, on the secure path to his salvation. Here you will see, Sisters, how important it was to win the previous battles. I am certain the Lord never fails to give a person like this security of conscience, which is no small blessing. I said ""security"" and I was wrong, for there is no security in this life; so always understand that I mean ""if he doesn't abandon the path he began on.""
2. It is a great misery to have to live a life in which we must always walk like those whose enemies are at their doorstep; they can neither sleep nor eat without weapons and without being always frightened lest somewhere these enemies might be able to break through this fortress. O my Lord and my Good, how is it that You want us to desire so miserable a life, for it isn't possible to stop wanting and asking You to take us out of it unless there is hope of losing it for You or of spending it very earnestly in Your service or, above all, of understanding what Your will is? If it is Your will, my God, may we die with You, as St. Thomas said; for living without You and with these fears of the possibility",2,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,2,14,1,17,27,7,5,5,8,6,12,16,10,1,3,0,1,5,1,1
"698",1577,90,"of losing You forever is nothing else than dying often. That's why, daughters, I say that the blessedness we must ask for is that of being already secure with the blessed. For with these fears, what happiness can anyone have whose whole happiness is to please God? Consider that this happiness was had -- and in much greater degree -- by some saints who fell into serious sins and that we are not sure that God will help us to get free from these sins and to do penance for them.
3. Certainly, my daughters, I am so fearful as I write this that I don't know how I'm writing it or how I live when I think about it, which is very often. Pray, my daughters, that His Majesty may live in me always. If He doesn't, what security can a life as badly spent as mine have? And do not become sad in knowing that this life has been badly spent, as I have sometimes observed you become when I tell this to you; you continue to desire that I might have lived a very holy life -- and you are right. I too would want to have so lived, but what can I do if I have lost holiness through my own fault! I will not complain about God who gave me enough help to carry out your desires. I cannot say this without tears and being very ashamed that I am writing something for those who can teach me. Doing so has been a hard command to obey! May it please the Lord that since it is being done for Him it may be of some benefit to you so that You may ask Him to pardon this miserable and bold creature. But His Majesty well knows that I can boast only of His mercy, and since I cannot cease being what I have been, I have no other remedy than to approach His mercy and to trust in the merits of His Son and of the Virgin, His Mother, whose habit I wear so unworthily, and you wear. Praise Him, my daughters, for you truly belong to our Lady. Thus you have no reason to be ashamed of my misery since you have such a good Mother. Imitate her and reflect that the grandeur of our Lady and the good of having her for your patroness must be indeed great since my sins and being what I am have not been enough to tarnish",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,16,1,16,23,6,0,6,9,10,8,15,8,0,2,1,2,3,1,0
"699",1577,91,"in any way this sacred order.
4. But one thing I advise you: not because you have such a Mother or Patroness should you feel secure, for David was very holy, and you already know who Solomon was. Don't pay any attention to the enclosure and the penance in which you live or feel safe in the fact that you are always conversing with God and practicing such continual prayer and being so withdrawn from the world of things and, in your opinion, holding them in abhorrence. These practices are all good, but not a sufficient reason, as I have said, for us to stop fearing. So, continue to say this verse and often bear it in mind: Beatus vir qui timet Dominum.
5. I don't remember what I was speaking about, for I have digressed a great deal and in thinking of myself I feel helpless, as a bird with broken wings, when it comes to saying anything good. So I want to leave this matter aside for now. Let me get back to what I began telling you concerning souls that have entered the third dwelling places, for the Lord has done them no small favor, but a very great one, in letting them get through the first difficulties. I believe that through the goodness of God there are many of these souls in the world. They long not to offend His Majesty, even guarding themselves against venial sins; they are fond of doing penance and setting aside periods for recollection; they spend their time well, practicing works of charity toward their neighbors; and are very balanced in their use of speech and dress and in the governing of their households -- those who have them. Certainly, this is a state to be desired. And, in my opinion, there is no reason why entrance even into the final dwelling place should be denied these souls, nor will the Lord deny them this entrance if they desire it; for such a desire is an excellent way to prepare oneself; so that every favor may be granted.
6. O Jesus, and who will say that he doesn't want a good so wonderful, especially after having passed through the most difficult trial? No, nobody will. We all say that we want this good. But since there is need of still more in order that the soul possess the Lord completely, it is not enough to say we want it; just as this was not enough for the young man whom the Lord",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,3,17,0,8,17,3,1,1,11,6,11,11,7,0,8,3,0,0,0,0
"700",1577,92,"told what one must do in order to be perfect. From the time I began to speak of these dwelling places I have had this young man in mind. For we are literally like him; and ordinarily the great dryness in prayer comes from this, although it also has other causes. And I'm leaving aside mention of some interior trials that many good souls undergo (unbearable trials and not at all due to their own fault), from which the Lord always frees them to their own great benefit, and mention of those who suffer from melancholy and other illnesses. Briefly, in all things we have to let God be the judge. What I've said, I believe, is what usually happens; for since these souls realize that they wouldn't commit a sin for anything -- many wouldn't even advertently commit a venial sin -- and that they conduct their lives and households well, they cannot accept patiently that the door of entry to the place where our King dwells be closed to them who consider themselves His vassals. But even though a king here on earth has many vassals, not all enter his chamber. Enter, enter, my daughters, into the interior rooms; pass on from your little works. By the mere fact that you are Christians you must do all these things and much more. It is enough for you to be God's vassals; don't let your desire be for so much that as a result you will be left with nothing. Behold the saints who entered this King's chamber, and you will see the difference between them and us. Don't ask for what you have not deserved, nor should it enter our minds that we have merited this favor however much we may have served -- we who have offended God.
7. Oh, humility, humility! I don't know what kind of temptation I'm undergoing in this matter that I cannot help but think that anyone who makes such an issue of this dryness is a little lacking in humility. I said that I've omitted mention of those great interior trials I've referred to, for those involve much more than just a lack of devotion. Let us prove ourselves, my sisters, or let the Lord prove us, for He knows well how to do this even though we often don't want to understand it. Let us speak now of those souls whose lives are so well ordered; let us recognize what they do for God, and we shall at once",0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,14,0,8,15,2,1,2,12,5,9,7,13,1,4,2,0,1,0,0
"701",1577,93,"see how we have no reason for complaining of His Majesty. If, like the young man in the Gospel, we turn our backs and go away sad when the Lord tells us what we must do to be perfect, what do you want His Majesty to do? For He must give the reward in conformity with the love we have for Him. And this love, daughters, must not be fabricated in our imaginations but proved by deeds. And don't think He needs our works; He needs the determination of our wills.
8. We seem to think that everything is done when we willingly take and wear the religious habit and abandon all worldly things and possession for Him -- even though these possessions may amount to no more than the nets St. Peter possessed, for he who gives what he has thinks he gives enough. This renunciation is a good enough preparation if one perseveres in it and doesn't turn back and become involved with the vermin in the first rooms, even if it be only in desire. There is no doubt that if a person perseveres in this nakedness and detachment from all worldly things he will reach his goal. But this perseverance includes the condition -- and note that I am advising you of this -- that you consider yourselves useless servants, as St. Paul, or Christ, says; and believe that you have not put our Lord under any obligation to grant you these kinds of favors. Rather, as one who has received more, you are more indebted. What can we do for a God so generous that He died for us, created us, and gives us being? Shouldn't we consider ourselves lucky to be able to repay something of what we owe Him for His service toward us? I say these words ""His service toward us"" unwillingly; but the fact is that He did nothing else but serve us all the time He lived in this world. And yet we ask Him again for favors and gifts.
9. Reflect a great deal, daughters, on some of the things that are here pointed out, even though in a jumbled way, for I don't know how to explain them further. The Lord will give you understanding of them so that out of dryness you may draw humility -- and not disquiet, which is what the devil aims after. Be convinced that where humility is truly present God will give a peace and conformity -- even though He may never",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,1,9,1,6,16,1,0,3,16,4,13,14,12,1,2,1,1,0,2,0
"702",1577,94,"give consolations -- by which one will walk with greater contentment than will others with their consolations. For often, as you have read, the divine Majesty gives these consolations to the weaker souls; although I think we would not exchange these consolations for the fortitude of those who walk in dryness. We are fonder of consolations than we are of the cross. Test us, Lord -- for You know the truth -- so that we may know ourselves.

CHAPTER 2
 
Continues on the same topic; deals with dryness in prayer; with what, in her opinion, might take place at this stage; how it is necessary to test ourselves; and with the fact that the Lord does try those who are in these dwelling places.
 
1. I have known some souls and even many -- I believe I can say -- who have reached this state and have lived many years in this upright and well-ordered way both in body and soul, insofar as can be known. After these years, when it seems they have become lords of the world, at least clearly disillusioned in its regard, His Majesty will try them in some minor matters, and they will go about so disturbed and afflicted that it puzzles me and even makes me fearful. It's useless to give them advice, for since they have engaged so long in the practice of virtue they think they can teach others and that they are more than justified in feeling disturbed.
2. In sum, I have found neither a way of consoling nor a cure for such persons other than to show them compassion in their affliction -- and, indeed, compassion is felt on seeing them subject to so much misery -- and not contradict their reasoning. For everything in their minds leads them to think they are suffering these things for God, and so, they don't come to realize that their disturbance is an imperfection. This is another mistake of persons so advanced. There is no reason for us to be surprised at what they experience; although I do think the feeling stirred by such things should pass quickly. For God often desires that His chosen ones feel their wretchedness, and He withdraws His favor a little. No more is necessary, for I would wager that we'd then soon get to know ourselves. The nature of this trial is immediately understood, for they recognize their fault very clearly. Sometimes seeing their fault distresses them more than the thing that disturbs them, for unable",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,0,2,10,0,16,9,8,1,4,23,7,5,10,8,2,1,6,1,1,0,0
"703",1577,95,"to help themselves they are affected by earthly happenings even though these may not be very burdensome. This distress, I think, is a great mercy from God; and although it is a defect, it is very beneficial for humility.
3. As for the persons I am speaking about, this is not so. But, as I have said, they canonize these feelings in their minds and would like others to do so. I want to mention some of these feelings so that we may understand and test ourselves before the Lord test us. It is very important to be prepared and to have understood ourselves beforehand.
4. A rich person without children or anyone to whom he might want to leave his possessions happens to lose his wealth, but not to such an extent that he lacks necessities for himself and for the management of his household; he even has a surplus. If he should go about as worried and disturbed as he would be if not even a piece of bread were left, how can our Lord ask him to leave all for Him? Here the person makes the excuse that he feels the way he does because he wants these things for the poor. But I believe that God has a greater desire that such a person conform to the divine will and that, though this person may try to procure such wealth, he keep his soul at rest rather than worry about charity of such a kind. And if the person doesn't do this, because the Lord has not brought him so far, well and good; but he should understand that he lacks this freedom of spirit. And because the Lord will ask him for it, he should prepare himself so that the Lord may give it to him; he will be asking His Majesty for it.
A person has plenty to eat and even a surplus; the opportunity presents itself for him to acquire more wealth; all right, let him do so if it is offered to him. But if he strives for wealth and after possessing it strives for more and more, however good the intention may be (for he should have a good intention because, as I have said, these are virtuous persons of prayer), he need have no fear of ascending to the dwelling places closest to the King.
5. There is a similar occurrence when an opportunity presents itself for these persons to be despised or to lose a little honor. God often grants them",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,7,13,0,11,20,6,1,2,8,9,19,16,2,0,3,3,0,0,0,2
"704",1577,96,"the favor of enduring such a thing; for He is very fond of favoring virtue publicly so that virtue itself will not undergo a loss of esteem. Or He will also do so because they have served Him, for this Beloved of ours is very good. But now they are left in such disquiet they cannot help themselves, nor can they quickly get rid of this disturbance. God help me! Aren't these the ones who for a long while now have considered how the Lord suffered and how good suffering is, and who have desired it? They would like everyone to live a life as well ordered as they do; and please God they will not think their grief is for the faults of others and in their minds turn it into something meritorious.
6. It must seem to you, Sisters, that I'm not staying on the subject or not speaking to you, for these things don't take place here. Neither do we have wealth nor do we desire or strive for it, nor does anyone do injury to us. As a result the examples are not relevant to us. But from these examples many lessons can be learned about things which it would not be good to single out, nor would there be reason to do so. Through the above examples you will understand whether or not you are truly stripped of what you have left behind. For little things happen even though not of this kind, in which you can very well test and know whether or not you are the rulers of your passions. And believe me the whole affair doesn't lie in whether or not we wear the religious habit but in striving to practice the virtues, in surrendering our will to God in everything, in bringing our life into accordance with what His Majesty ordains for it, and in desiring that His will not ours be done. Since we may not have reached this stage -- humility, as I have said! Humility is the ointment for our wounds because if we indeed have humility, even though there may be a time of delay, the surgeon who is our Lord, will come to heal us.
7. The penance these souls do is well balanced, like their lives. They desire penance a great deal so as to serve our Lord by it. Nothing of this is wrong, and thus they are very discreet in doing it in a way so as not to harm their health. Have",1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,1,10,1,8,21,1,0,4,9,8,9,12,4,0,2,0,1,7,1,0
"705",1577,97,"no fear that they will kill themselves, for their reason is still very much in control. Love has not yet reached the point of overwhelming reason. But I should like us to use our reason to make ourselves dissatisfied with this way of serving God, always going step by step, for we'll never finish this journey. And since, in our opinion, we are continually walking and are tired (for, believe me, it is a wearisome journey), we will be doing quite well if we don't go astray. But does it seem to you, daughters, that if we could go from one land to another in eight days, it would be good to take a year through wind, snow, rain, and bad roads? Wouldn't it be better to make the journey all at once? For all these obstacles are present, as well as danger from snakes. Oh what good proofs I could give of these things. And please God I may have passed beyond this stage, for often enough it seems to me I haven't.
8. Since we are so circumspect, everything offends us because we fear everything; so we don't dare go further -- as if we could reach these dwelling places while leaving to other persons the trouble of treading the path for us. Since this is not possible, let us exert ourselves, my Sisters, for the love of the Lord; let's abandon our reason and our fears into His hands; let's forget this natural weakness that can take up our attention so much. Let the prelates take care of our bodily needs; that's their business. As for ourselves, we should care only about moving quickly so as to see this Lord. Even though the comfort you have is little or none at all, we could be deceived by worry about our health. This I know. And I also know that the whole affair doesn't lie in what pertains to the body, for this is what is the least important. The journey I am speaking of must be taken with great humility. For if you have understood, it is in regard to humility, I believe, that there is an obstacle for those who do not go forward. It should seem to us that we have gone but a few steps, and we should believe this to be so, and that those our Sisters have taken are rapid ones; and not only should we desire but we should strive that they consider us the most miserable of all.
9. With",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,4,1,15,14,7,3,4,15,12,19,14,9,1,1,1,3,3,2,0
"706",1577,98,"humility present, this stage is a most excellent one. If humility is lacking, we will remain here our whole life -- and with a thousand afflictions and miseries. For since we will not have abandoned ourselves, this state will be very laborious and burdensome. We shall be walking while weighed down with this mud of our human misery, which is not so with those who ascend to the remaining rooms. But in these rooms of which we're speaking, the Lord, as one who is just or even merciful, does not fail to pay; for He always gives much more than we deserve by giving us consolations far greater than those we find in the comforts and distractions of life. But I don't think He gives much spiritual delight unless sometimes in order to invite souls by the sight of what takes place in the remaining dwelling places and so that they will prepare themselves to enter them.
10. It will seem to you that consolations and spiritual delights are the same, so why should I make this distinction? To me it seems there is a very great difference between the two. Now I can be wrong. I'll say what I understand about this when I speak of the fourth dwelling places which come after these. For since something will have to be explained about the spiritual delights the Lord gives there, the discussion will be more appropriate at that time. And although the explanation may seem to be useless it might help somewhat so that in understanding the nature of each thing you will be able to strive for what is best. Great solace comes to souls God brings there, and confusion to those who think they have everything. If souls are humble they will be moved to give thanks. If there is some lack in humility, they will feel an inner distaste for which they will find no reason. For perfection as well as its reward does not consist in spiritual delights but in greater love and in deeds done with greater justice and truth.
11. You will wonder, if this is true -- as it is -- what use it serves to explain and treat of these interior favors. I don't know. Ask him who ordered me to write, for I am not obliged to dispute with superiors but to obey -- nor would disputing with them be right. What I can truthfully say to you is that at one time I didn't have or even know about",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,1,11,0,11,21,6,0,5,17,7,8,18,7,1,4,1,0,2,1,1
"707",1577,99,"these favors through experience or think that I would ever in my life know about them in this way -- and rightly so, for it was happiness enough for me to know, or by conjecture understand, that I was pleasing God in something. But when I read in books about these delights and favors the Lord grants souls that serve Him, I was very much consoled and moved to give great praise to God. Well, if my soul which was so wretched did this, those souls that are good and humble will praise Him much more. And if one alone is led to praise Him even once, it is in my opinion very good that the subject be mentioned so that we know about the happiness and delight we lose through our own fault. Moreover, if these favors are from God they come brimming over with love and fortitude by which you can journey with less labor and grow in the practice of works and virtues. Don't think that it matters little to lose such favors through our own fault; when it isn't our fault, the Lord is just. His Majesty will give you through other paths what He keeps from you on this one because of what He knows, for His secrets are very hidden; at least what He does will without any doubt be what is most suitable for us.
12. What it seems to me would be highly beneficial for those who through the goodness of the Lord are in this state (for, as I have said, He grants them no small mercy because they are very close to ascending higher) is that they study diligently how to be prompt in obedience. And even if they are not members of a religious order, it would be a great thing for them to have -- as do many persons -- someone whom they could consult so as not to do their own will in anything. Doing our own will is usually what harms us. And they shouldn't seek another of their own making, as they say -- one who is so circumspect about everything; but seek out someone who is very free from illusion about the things of the world. For in order to know ourselves, it helps a great deal to speak with someone who already knows the world for what it is. And it helps also because when we see some things done by others that seem so impossible for us and the ease with",3,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,0,1,14,0,8,26,1,0,3,12,7,10,19,2,1,3,0,0,1,1,0
"708",1577,100,"which they are done, we become very encouraged. And it seems that through the flight of these others we also will make bold to fly, as do the bird's fledglings when they are taught; for even though they do not begin to soar immediately, little by little they imitate the parent. Receiving this help is most beneficial; I know. However determined they are to keep from offending the Lord, these persons will be right not to place themselves in the occasion of offending Him. Since they are close to the first dwelling places, they could easily return to them. Their fortitude is not founded on solid ground, as is the case with those who are tried in suffering, for these latter know about the storms of the world and what little reason there is to fear them or desire the world's consolations. But it would be possible for the former in a great persecution to return to these consolations. The devil knows well how to stir up tempests so as to do us harm, and these persons would be unable to bear the trials that would come from their zeal to prevent others from committing sin.
13. Let us look at our own faults and leave aside those of others, for it is very characteristic of persons with such well-ordered lives to be shocked by everything. Perhaps we could truly learn from the one who shocks us what is most important even though we may surpass him in external composure and our way of dealing with others. Although good, these latter things are not what is most important; nor is there any reason to desire that everyone follow at once our own path, or to set about teaching the way of the spirit to someone who perhaps doesn't know what such a thing is. For with these desires that God gives us, Sisters, about the good of souls, we can make many mistakes. So it is better to carry out what our rule says, to strive to live always in silence and hope, for the Lord will take care of these souls. If we ourselves are not negligent in beseeching His Majesty to do so, we shall, with His favor, do much good. May He be blessed forever. THE FOURTH DWELLING PLACES
 
Contains Three Chapters
CHAPTER 1
 
Discusses the difference between consolations (or feelings of tenderness) in prayer and spiritual delights. Tells of her happiness on learning the difference between the mind and the intellect. This knowledge is very beneficial",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,11,0,13,23,3,2,1,13,7,11,16,5,1,2,1,0,1,0,0
"709",1577,101,"for anyone who is greatly distracted in prayer.
 
1. In order to begin to speak of the fourth dwelling places I really need to entrust myself, as I've already done, to the Holy Spirit and beg Him to speak for me from here on that I may say something about the remaining rooms in a way that you will understand. For supernatural experiences begin here. These are something most difficult to explain, if His Majesty doesn't do so, as was said in another book I wrote fourteen years ago, more or less, in which I dealt with these experiences to the extent of my knowledge of them at that time. Although I think I now have a little more light about these favors the Lord grants to some souls, knowing how to explain them is a different matter. May His Majesty help me to do so if it will be of some benefit; and if not, then no.
2. Since these dwelling places now are closer to where the King is, their beauty is great. There are things to see and understand so delicate that the intellect is incapable of finding words to explain them, although something might turn out to be well put and not at all obscure to the unexperienced; and anyone who has experience, especially when there is a lot of it, will understand very well.
It will seem that to reach these dwelling places one will have had to live in the others a long while. Although it is usual that a person will have to have stayed in those already spoken about, there is no certain rule, as you will have often heard. For the Lord gives when He desires, as He desires, and to whom He desires. Since these blessings belong to Him, He does no injustice to anyone.
3. Poisonous creatures rarely enter these dwelling places. If they enter they do no harm; rather, they are the occasion of gain. I hold that the situation is much better in this stage of prayer when these creatures do enter and wage war, for the devil could deceive one with respect to the spiritual delights given by God if there were no temptations, and do much more harm than when temptations are felt. The soul would not gain so much; at least all the things contributing to its merit would be removed, and it would be left in a habitual absorption. For when a soul is in one continual state, I don't consider it safe, nor",1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,13,1,11,15,5,2,0,13,3,14,22,3,2,6,1,0,1,0,0
"710",1577,102,"do I think it is possible for the spirit of the Lord to be in one fixed state during this exile.
4. Well now, in speaking about what I said I'd mention here concerning the difference in prayer between consolations and spiritual delights, the term ""consolations,"" I think, can be given to those experiences we ourselves acquire through our own meditation and petitions to the Lord, those that proceed from our own nature -- although God in the end does have a hand in them; for it must be understood, in whatever I say, that without Him we can do nothing. But the consolations arise from the virtuous work itself that we perform, and it seems that we have earned them through our own effort and are rightly consoled for having engaged in such deeds. But if we reflect upon this, we see that we experience the same joyful consolations in many of the things that can happen to us on earth; for example: when someone suddenly inherits a great fortune; when we suddenly see a person we love very much; when we succeed in a large and important business matter and of which everyone speaks well; when you see your husband or brother or son alive after someone has told you he is dead. I have seen the flow of tears from great consolations, and this has even happened to me at times. I think that just as these joyful consolations are natural so are those afforded us by the things of God, but these latter are of a nobler kind, although the others are not bad. In sum, joyful consolations in prayer have their beginning in our own human nature and end in God.
The spiritual delights begin in God, but human nature feels and enjoys them as much as it does those I mentioned -- and much more. O Jesus, how I long to know how to explain this! For I discern, I think, a very recognizable difference, but I don't have the knowledge to be able to explain myself. May the Lord do so.
5. Now I remember a line that we say at Prime, in the latter part of the verse at the end of the last psalm: Cum dilatasti cor meum. For anyone who has had much experience these words are sufficient to see the difference between consolations and spiritual delights; for anyone who has not, more words are needed. The consolations that were mentioned do not expand the heart; rather, they usually seem to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,1,0,3,16,2,2,16,0,0,1,16,2,4,12,1,5,5,2,2,1,1,0
"711",1577,103,"constrain it a little -- although there is the greatest consolation at seeing what is done for God. But some anxious tears come that in a way, it seems, are brought on by the passions. I don't know much about these passions of the soul -- knowledge of them might perhaps have enabled me to explain -- and what proceeds from sensuality and from our human nature, for I am very dull. If only I knew how to explain myself, for since I have undergone this I understand it. Knowledge and learning are a great help in everything.
6. My experience of this state (I mean of this joy and consolation that comes during meditation) is that if I began to weep over the Passion I didn't know how to stop until I got a severe headache; if I did so over my sins, the same thing happened. Our Lord granted me quite a favor. Yet I don't want to examine now whether the one or the other is better, but I would like to know how to explain the difference there is between the one and the other. It is for these reasons sometimes that these tears flow and desires come, and they are furthered by human nature and one's temperament; but finally, as I have said, they end in God regardless of their nature. They are to be esteemed if there is the humility to understand that one is no better because of experiencing them, for it cannot be known whether they are all effects of love. When they are, the gift is God's.
For the most part, the souls in the previous dwelling places are the ones who have these devout feelings, for these souls work almost continually with the intellect, engaging in discursive thought and meditation. And they do well because nothing further has been given them; although they would be right if they engaged for a while in making acts of love, praising God, rejoicing in His goodness, that He is who He is, and in desiring His honor and glory. These acts should be made insofar as possible, for they are great awakeners of the will. Such souls would be well advised when the Lord gives them these acts not to abandon them for the sake of finishing the usual meditation.
7. Because I have spoken at length on this subject elsewhere, I will say nothing about it here. I only wish to inform you that in order to profit by this path and ascend",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,1,15,0,9,22,2,0,5,21,11,14,15,2,1,3,1,0,1,5,0
"712",1577,104,"to the dwelling places we desire, the important thing is not to think much but to love much; and so do that which best stirs you to love. Perhaps we don't know what love is. I wouldn't be very surprised, because it doesn't consist in great delight but in desiring with strong determination to please God in everything, in striving, insofar as possible, not to offend Him, and in asking Him for the advancement of the honor and glory of His Son and the increase of the Catholic Church. These are the signs of love. Don't think the matter lies in thinking of nothing else, and that if you become a little distracted all is lost.
8. I have been very afflicted at times in the midst of this turmoil of mind. A little more than four years ago I came to understand through experience that the mind (or imagination, to put it more clearly) is not the intellect. I asked a learned man and he told me that this was so; which brought me no small consolation. For since the intellect is one of the soul's faculties, it was an arduous thing for me that it should be so restless at times. Ordinarily the mind flies about quickly, for only God can hold it fast in such a way as to make it seem that we are somehow loosed from this body. I have seen, I think, that the faculties of my soul were occupied and recollected in God while my mind on the other hand was distracted. This distraction puzzled me.
9. O Lord, take into account the many things we suffer on this path for lack of knowledge! The trouble is that since we do not think there is anything to know other than that we must think of You, we do not even know how to ask those who know nor do we understand what there is to ask. Terrible trials are suffered because we don't understand ourselves, and that which isn't bad at all but good we think is a serious fault. This lack of knowledge causes the afflictions of many people who engage in prayer; complaints about interior trials, at least to a great extent, by people who have no learning; melancholy and loss of health; and even the complete abandonment of prayer. For such persons don't reflect that there is an interior world here within us. Just as we cannot stop the movement of the heavens, but they proceed in rapid motion, so",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,10,0,20,20,6,2,6,24,7,8,8,6,1,0,2,2,1,4,0
"713",1577,105,"neither can we stop our mind; and then the faculties of the soul go with it, and we think we are lost and have wasted the time spent before God. But the soul is perhaps completely joined with Him in the dwelling places very close to the center while the mind is on the outskirts of the castle suffering from a thousand wild and poisonous beasts, and meriting by this suffering. As a result we should not be disturbed; nor should we abandon prayer, which is what the devil wants us to do. For the most part all the trials and disturbance come from our not understanding ourselves.
10. While writing this, I'm thinking about what's going on in my head with the great noise there that I mentioned in the beginning. It makes it almost impossible for me to write what I was ordered to. It seems as if there are in my head many rushing rivers and that these waters are hurtling downward, and many little birds and whistling sounds, not in the ears but in the upper part of the head where, they say, the higher part of the soul is. And I was in that superior part for a long time, for it seems this powerful movement of the spirit is a swift upward one. Please God I'll remember to mention the cause of this in discussing the dwelling places that come further on, for this is not a fitting place to do so, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Lord gave me this headache so that I could understand these things better. For all this turmoil in my head doesn't hinder prayer or what I am saying, but the soul is completely taken up in its quiet, love, desires, and clear knowledge.
11. Now then if the superior part of the soul is in the superior part of the head, why isn't the soul disturbed? This I don't know. But I do know that what I say is true. The pain is felt when suspension does not accompany the prayer. When suspension does accompany prayer, no pain is felt until the suspension passes. But it would be very bad if I were to abandon everything on account of this obstacle. And so it isn't good for us to be disturbed by our thoughts, nor should we be concerned. If the devil causes them, they will cease with this suspension. If they come, as they do, from one of the many miseries inherited through the",3,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,16,0,20,11,8,1,7,13,5,15,12,7,0,7,2,6,4,1,0
"714",1577,106,"sin of Adam, let us be patient and endure them for the love of God since we are likewise subject to eating and sleeping without being able to avoid it, which is quite a trial.
12. Let us recognize our misery and desire to go where no one will taunt us, for sometimes I recall having heard these words the bride says in the Song of Songs. And indeed I don't find in all of life anything about which they can be more rightly said. It seems to me that all the contempt and trials one can endure in life cannot be compared to these interior battles. And disquiet and war can be suffered if we find peace where we live, as I have already said. But that we desire to rest from the thousand trials there are in the world and that the Lord wants to prepare us for tranquility and that within ourselves lies the obstacle to such rest and tranquility cannot fail to be very painful and almost unbearable. So, Lord, bring us to the place where these miseries will not taunt us, for they seem sometimes to be making fun of the soul. Even in this life, the Lord frees the soul from these miseries when it reaches the last dwelling place, as we shall say if God wills.
13. These miseries will not afflict or assail everyone as much as they did me for many years because of my wretchedness. It seems that I myself wanted to take vengeance on myself. And since the experience was something so painful for me, I think perhaps that it will be so for you too. And I so often speak of it here and there that I might sometime succeed in explaining to you that it is an unavoidable thing and should not be a disturbance or affliction for you but that we must let the millclapper go clacking on, and must continue grinding our flour and not fail to work with the will and the intellect.
14. There is a more and a less to this obstacle in accordance with one's health and age. Let the poor soul suffer even though it has no fault in this; we have other faults, which makes it right for us to practice patience. And since our reading and the counsels we receive (that is, to pay no attention to these thoughts) don't suffice, I don't think that the time spent in explaining these things for those of you with little knowledge",2,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,3,9,1,20,8,7,4,8,14,6,9,17,5,0,8,0,1,6,1,1
"715",1577,107,"and consoling you in this matter is time lost. But until the Lord wants to enlighten us, these counsels will be of little help. Yet, it is necessary and His Majesty wishes us to take the means and understand ourselves; and let's not blame the soul for what a weak imagination, human nature, and the devil cause.

CHAPTER 2
 
Continues on the same subject and explains through a comparison the nature of spiritual delight and how this is attained by not seeking it.
 
1. God help me with what I have undertaken! I've already forgot what I was dealing with, for business matters and poor health have forced me to set this work aside just when I was at my best; and since I have a poor memory everything will come out confused because I can't go back to read it over. And perhaps even everything else I say is confused; at least that's what I feel it is.
It seems to me I have explained the nature of consolations in the spiritual life. Since they are sometimes mixed with our own passions, they are the occasion of loud sobbing; and I have heard some persons say they experience a tightening in the chest and even external bodily movements that they cannot restrain. The force of these passions can cause nosebleeds and other things just as painful. I don't know how to explain anything about these experiences because I haven't had any. But they must nonetheless be consoling, for, as I'm saying, the whole experience ends in the desire to please God and enjoy His Majesty's company.
2. The experiences that I call spiritual delight in God, that I termed elsewhere the prayer of quiet, are of a very different kind, as those of you who by the mercy of God have experience them will know. Let's consider, for a better understanding, that we see two founts with two water troughs. (For I don't find anything more appropriate to explain some spiritual experiences than water; and this is because I know little and have no helpful cleverness of mind and am so fond of this element that I have observed it more attentively than other things. In all the things that so great and wise a God has created there must be many beneficial secrets, and those who understand them do benefit, although I believe that in each little thing created by God there is more than what is understood, even if it is a little ant.)
3. These two troughs are",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,3,15,0,8,17,2,1,2,22,13,6,11,6,1,6,2,3,4,2,2
"716",1577,108,"filled with water in different ways; with one the water comes from far away through many aqueducts and the use of much ingenuity; with the other the source of the water is right there, and the trough fills without any noise. If the spring is abundant, as is this one we are speaking about, the water overflows once the trough is filled, forming a large stream. There is no need of any skill, nor does the building of aqueducts have to continue; but water is always flowing from the spring.
The water coming from the aqueducts is comparable, in my opinion, to the consolations I mentioned that are drawn from meditation. For we obtain them through thoughts, assisting ourselves, using creatures to help our meditation, and tiring the intellect. Since, in the end, the consolation comes through our own efforts, noise is made when there has to be some replenishing of the benefits the consolation causes in the soul, as has been said. 
4. With this other fount, the water comes from its own source which is God. And since His Majesty desires to do so -- when He is pleased to grant some supernatural favor -- He produces this delight with the greatest peace and quiet and sweetness in the very interior part of ourselves. I don't know from where or how, nor is that happiness and delight experienced, as are earthly consolations, in the heart. I mean there is no similarity at the beginning, for afterward the delight fills everything; this water overflows through all the dwelling places and faculties until reaching the body. This is why I said that it begins in God and ends in ourselves. For, certainly, as anyone who may have experienced it will see, the whole exterior man enjoys this spiritual delight and sweetness.
5. I was now thinking, while writing this, that the verse mentioned above, Dilatasti cor meum, says the heart was expanded. I don't think the experience is something, as I say, that rises from the heart, but from another part still more interior, as from something deep. I think this must be the center of the soul, as I later came to understand and will mention at the end. For certainly I see secrets within ourselves that have often caused me to marvel. And how many more there must be! Oh, my Lord and my God, how great are Your grandeurs! We go about here below like foolish little shepherds, for while it seems that we are getting some",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,9,0,2,18,1,0,0,9,14,5,14,7,2,8,0,4,1,0,8
"717",1577,109,"knowledge of You it must amount to no more than nothing; for even in our own selves there are great secrets that we don't understand. I say ""no more than nothing"" because I'm comparing it to the many, many secrets that are in You, not because the grandeurs we see in You are not extraordinary; and that includes those we can attain knowledge of through Your works.
6. To return to the verse, what I think is helpful in it for explaining this matter is the idea of expansion. It seems that since that heavenly water begins to rise from this spring I'm mentioning that is deep within us, it swells and expands our whole interior being, producing ineffable blessings; nor does the soul even understand what is given to it there. It perceives a fragrance, let us say for now, as though there were in that interior depth a brazier giving off sweet-smelling perfumes. No light is seen, nor is the place seen where the brazier is; but the warmth and the fragrant fumes spread through the entire soul and even often enough, as I have said, the body shares in them. See now that you understand me; no heat is felt, nor is there the scent of any perfume, for the experience is more delicate than an experience of these things; but I use the examples only so as to explain it to you. And let persons who have not experienced these things understand that truthfully they do happen and are felt in this way, and the soul understands them in a manner clearer than is my explanation right now. This spiritual delight is not something that can be imagined, because however diligent our efforts we cannot acquire it. The very experience of it makes us realize that it is not of the same metal as we ourselves but fashioned from the purest gold of the divine wisdom. Here, in my opinion, the faculties are not united but absorbed and looking as though in wonder at what they see.
7. It's possible that in dealing with these interior matters I might contradict something of what I said elsewhere. That's no surprise, because in the almost fifteen years since I wrote it the Lord may perhaps have given me clearer understanding in these matters than I had before. Now, as then, I could be completely mistaken -- but I would not lie, because by God's mercy I'd rather suffer a thousand deaths. I speak of what I understand.
8. It",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,10,1,4,14,0,2,1,23,10,5,12,5,6,5,3,1,0,0,1
"718",1577,110,"seems clear to me the will must in some way be united with God's will. But it is in the effects and deeds following afterward that one discerns the true value of prayer; there is no better crucible for testing prayer. It is quite a great favor from our Lord if the person receiving the favor recognizes it, and a very great one if he doesn't turn back.
You will at once desire, my daughters, to obtain this prayer; and you are right, for, as I have said, the soul will never understand the favors the Lord is granting there or the love with which He is drawing it nearer to Himself. It is good to try to understand how we can obtain such a favor; so I am going to tell you what I have understood about this.
9. Let's leave aside the times when our Lord is pleased to grant it because He wants to and for no other reason. He knows why; we don't have to meddle in this. After you have done what should be done by those in the previous dwelling places; humility! humility! By this means the Lord allows Himself to be conquered with regard to anything we want from Him. The first sign for seeing whether or not you have humility is that you do not think you deserve these favors and spiritual delights from the Lord or that you will receive them in your lifetime.
You will ask me how then one can obtain them without seeking them. I answer that for the following reasons there is no better way than the one I mentioned, of not striving for them. First, because the initial thing necessary for such favors is to love God without self-interest. Second, because there is a slight lack of humility in thinking that for our miserable services something so great can be obtained. Third, because the authentic preparation for these favors on the part of those of us who, after all, have offended Him is the desire to suffer and imitate the Lord rather than to have spiritual delights. Fourth, because His Majesty is not obliged to give them to us as He is to give us glory if we keep His commandments. (Without these favors we can be saved, and He knows better than we ourselves what is fitting for us and who of us truly loves Him. This is certain, I know. And I know persons who walk by the path of love as they ought to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,14,0,4,27,2,1,2,17,12,12,11,8,1,1,0,0,0,4,0
"719",1577,111,"walk, that is, only so as to serve their Christ crucified; not only do these persons refuse to seek spiritual delights from Him or to desire them but they beseech Him not to give them these favors during their lifetime. This is true.) The fifth reason is that we would be laboring in vain; for since this water must not be drawn through aqueducts as was the previous water, we are little helped by tiring ourselves if the spring doesn't want to produce it. I mean that no matter how much we meditate or how much we try to squeeze something out and have tears, this water doesn't come in such a way. It is given only to whom God wills to give it and often when the soul is least thinking of it.
10. We belong to Him, daughters. Let Him do whatever He likes with us, bring us wherever He pleases. I really believe that whoever humbles himself and is detached (I mean in fact because the detachment and humility must not be just in our thoughts -- for they often deceive us -- but complete) will receive the favor of this water from the Lord and many other favors that we don't know how to desire. May He be forever praised and blessed, amen.

CHAPTER 3
 
Deals with the prayer of recollection which for the most part the Lord gives before the prayer just mentioned. Tells about its effects and about those that come from that spiritual delight, given by the Lord, that was discussed in the previous chapter.
 
1. The effects of this prayer are many. I shall mention some. But first, I want to mention another kind of prayer that almost always begins before this one. Since I have spoken of such a prayer elsewhere, I shall say little. It is a recollection that also seems to me to be supernatural because it doesn't involve being in the dark or closing the eyes, nor does it consist in any exterior thing, since without first wanting to do so, one does close one's eyes and desire solitude. It seems that without any contrivance the edifice is being built, by means of this recollection, for the prayer that was mentioned. The senses and exterior things seem to be losing their hold because the souls is recovering what it had lost.
2. They say that the soul enters within itself and, at other times, that it rises above itself. With such terminology I wouldn't know how to clarify anything.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,21,0,4,10,0,0,3,19,14,11,17,7,2,3,1,2,1,0,4
"720",1577,112,"This is what's wrong with me: that I think you will understand by my way of explaining, while perhaps I'm the only one who will understand myself. Let us suppose that these senses and faculties (for I have already mentioned that these powers are the people of this castle, which is the image I have taken for my explanation) have gone outside and have walked for days and years with strangers -- enemies of the well-being of the castle. Having seen their perdition they've already begun to approach the castle even though they may not manage to remain inside because the habit of doing so is difficult to acquire. But still they are not traitors, and they walk in the environs of the castle. Once the great King, who is in the center dwelling place of this castle, sees their good will, He desires in His wonderful mercy to bring them back to Him. Like a good shepherd, with a whistle so gentle that even they themselves almost fail to hear it, He makes them recognize His voice and stops them from going so far astray so that they will return to their dwelling place. And this shepherd's whistle has such power that they abandon the exterior things in which they were estranged from Him and enter the castle.
3. I don't think I've ever explained it as clearly as I have now. When God grants the favor it is a great help to seek Him within where He is found more easily and in a way more beneficial to us than when sought in creatures, as St. Augustine says after having looked for Him in many places. Don't think this recollection is acquired by the intellect striving to think about God within itself, or by the imagination imagining Him within itself. Such efforts are good and an excellent kind of meditation because they are founded on a truth, which is that God is within us. But this isn't the prayer of recollection because it is something each one can do -- with the help of God, as should be understood of everything. But what I'm speaking of comes in a different way. Sometimes before one begins to think of God, these people are already inside the castle. I don't know in what way or how they heard their shepherd's whistle. It wasn't through the ears, because nothing is heard. But one noticeably senses a gentle drawing inward, as anyone who goes through this will observe, for I don't",7,1,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,8,0,7,15,2,1,2,21,7,2,9,4,4,7,0,1,0,0,0
"721",1577,113,"know how to make it clearer. It seems to me I have read where it was compared to a hedgehog curling up or a turtle drawing into a shell. (The one who wrote this example must have understood the experience well.) But these creatures draw inward whenever they want. In the case of this recollection, it doesn't come when we want it but when God wants to grant us the favor. I for myself hold that when His Majesty grants it, He does so to persons who are already beginning to despise the things of the world. I don't say that those in the married state do so in deed, for they cannot, but in desire; for He calls such persons especially so that they might be attentive to interior matters. So I believe that if we desire to make room for His Majesty, He will give not only this but more, and give it to those whom He begins to call to advance further.
4. May whoever experiences this within himself praise God greatly because it is indeed right to recognize the favor and give thanks, for doing so will dispose one for other greater favors. And this recollection is a preparation for being able to listen, as is counselled in some books, so that the soul instead of striving to engage in discourse strives to remain attentive and aware of what the Lord is working in it. If His Majesty has not begun to absorb us, I cannot understand how the mind can be stopped. There's no way of doing so without bringing about more harm than good, although there has been a lengthy controversy on this matter among some spiritual persons. For my part I must confess my lack of humility, but those in favor of stopping the mind have never given me a reason for submitting to what they say. One of them tried to convince me with a certain book by the saintly Friar Peter of Alcántara -- for I believe he is a saint -- to whom I would submit because I know that he knew. And we read it together, and he says the same thing I do; although not in my words. But it is clear in what he says that love must be already awakened. It could be that I'm mistaken, but I have the following reasons.
5. First, in this work of the spirit the one who thinks less and has less desire to act does more. What we must",5,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4,1,0,10,0,3,12,0,1,0,18,8,16,8,8,0,5,0,0,0,1,0
"722",1577,114,"do is beg like the needy poor before a rich and great emperor, and then lower our eyes and wait with humility. When through His secret paths it seems we understand that He hears us, then it is good to be silent since He has allowed us to remain near Him; and it will not be wrong to avoid working with the intellect -- if we can work with it, I mean. But if we don't yet know whether this King has heard or seen us, we mustn't become fools. The soul does become quite a fool when it tries to induce this prayer, and it is left much drier; and the imagination perhaps becomes more restless through the effort made not to think of anything. But the Lord desires that we beseech Him and call to mind that we are in His presence; He knows what is suitable for us. I cannot persuade myself to use human diligence in a matter in which it seems His Majesty has placed a limit, and I want to leave the diligence to Him. What He did not reserve to Himself are many other efforts we can make with His help, such as: penance, good deeds, and prayer -- insofar as our wretchedness can do these things.
6. The second reason is that these interior works are all gentle and peaceful; doing something arduous would cause more harm than good. I call any force that we might want to use ""something arduous;"" for example, it would be arduous to hold one's breath. Leave the soul in God's hands, let Him do whatever He wants with it, with the greatest resignation to the will of God.
The third reason is that the very care used not to think of anything will perhaps rouse the mind to think very much.
The fourth reason is that what is most essential and pleasing to God is that we be mindful of His honor and glory and forget ourselves and our own profit and comfort and delight. How is a person forgetful of self if he is so careful not to stir or even to allow his intellect or desires to be stirred to a longing for the greater glory of God, or if he rests in what he already has? When His Majesty desires the intellect to stop, He occupies it in another way and gives it a light so far above what we can attain that it remains absorbed. Then, without knowing how, the intellect is much",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,10,0,10,21,2,0,3,19,16,13,20,3,2,3,2,3,0,0,0
"723",1577,115,"better instructed than it was through all the soul's efforts not to make use of it. Since God gave us our faculties that we might work with them and in this work they find their reward, there is no reason to charm them; we should let them perform their task until God appoints them to another greater one.
7. What I understand to be most fitting for the soul the Lord has desired to put in this dwelling place is that which has been said. And without any effort or noise the soul should strive to cut down the rambling of the intellect -- but not suspend either it or the mind; it is good to be aware that one is in God's presence and of who God is. If what it feels within itself absorbs it, well and good. But let it not strive to understand the nature of this recollection, for it is given to the will. Let the soul enjoy it without any endeavors other than some loving words, for even though we may not try in this prayer to go without thinking of anything, I know that often the intellect will be suspended, even though for only a very brief moment.
8. But as I said elsewhere the reason why in this kind of prayer -- that is, the kind that is like the flowing spring in which the water does not come through aqueducts -- the soul restrains itself or is restrained is its realization that it doesn't understand what it desires; and so the mind wanders from one extreme to the other, like a fool unable to rest in anything. (I am referring to the kind of prayer this dwelling place began with, for I have joined the prayer of recollection, which I should have mentioned first, with this one. The prayer of recollection is much less intense than the prayer of spiritual delight from God that I mentioned. But it is the beginning through which one goes to the other; for in the prayer of recollection, meditation, or the work of the intellect, must not be set aside.) The will has such deep rest in its God that the clamor of the intellect is a terrible bother to it. There is no need to pay any attention to this clamor, for doing so would make the will lose much of what it enjoys. But one should leave the intellect go and surrender oneself into the arms of love, for His Majesty will teach",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,1,0,1,20,0,7,18,2,2,1,17,7,10,15,2,0,3,1,1,0,1,1
"724",1577,116,"the soul what it must do at that point. Almost everything lies in finding oneself unworthy of so great a good and in being occupied with giving thanks.
9. In order to deal with the prayer of recollection I postponed mention of the effects or signs in souls to whom God, our Lord, gives this prayer of quiet. What an expansion or dilation of the soul is may be clearly understood from the example of a fount whose water doesn't overflow into a stream because the fount itself is constructed of such material that the more water there is flowing into it the larger the trough becomes. So it seems is the case with this prayer and many other marvels that God grants to the soul, for He enables and prepares it so that it can keep everything within itself. Hence this interior sweetness and expansion can be verified in the fact that the soul is not as tied down as it was before in things pertaining to the service of God, but has much more freedom. Thus, in not being constrained by the fear of hell (because although there is even greater fear of offending God it loses servile fear here), this soul is left with great confidence that it will enjoy Him. The fear it used to have of doing penance and losing its health has disappeared, and it now thinks it will be able to do all things in God and has greater desire for penance than previously. The fear it used to have of trials it now sees to be tempered. Its faith is more alive; it knows that if it suffers trials for God, His Majesty will give it the grace to suffer them with patience. Sometimes it even desires them because there also remains a strong will to do something for God. Since its knowledge of God's grandeur grows, it considers itself to be more miserable. Because it has already experienced spiritual delight from God, it sees that worldly delights are like filth. It finds itself withdrawing from them little by little, and it is more master of itself for so doing. In sum, there is an improvement in all the virtues. It will continue to grow if it doesn't turn back now to offending God; because if it does, then everything will be lost however high on the summit the soul may be. Nor should it be understood that if God grants this favor once or twice to a soul all these",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,28,1,15,19,6,4,6,12,11,8,13,10,2,1,0,0,2,0,2
"725",1577,117,"good effects will be caused. It must persevere in receiving them, for in this perseverance lies all our good.
10. One strong warning I give to whoever finds himself in this state is that he guard very carefully against placing himself in the occasion of offending God. In this prayer the soul is not yet grown but is like a suckling child. If it turns away from its mother's breasts, what can be expected for it but death? I am very afraid that this will happen to anyone to whom God has granted this favor and who withdraws from prayer -- unless he does so for a particularly special reason -- or if he doesn't return quickly to prayer, for he will go from bad to worse. I know there is a great deal to fear in this matter. And I know some persons for whom I have felt quite sorry -- and I've seen what I'm speaking about -- because they have turned away from One who with so much love wanted to be their friend and proved it by deeds. I advise them so strongly not to place themselves in the occasions of sin because the devil tries much harder for a soul of this kind than for very many to whom the Lord does not grant these favors. For such a soul can do a great deal of harm to the devil by getting others to follow it, and it could be of great benefit to God's Church. And even though the devil may have no other reason than to see who it is to whom His Majesty shows particular love, that's sufficient for him to wear himself out trying to lead the soul to perdition. So these souls suffer much combat, and if they go astray, they stray much more than do others.
You, Sisters, are free of dangers, from what we can know. From pride and vainglory may God deliver you. If the devil should counterfeit God's favors, this will be known by the fact that these good effects are not caused, but just the opposite.
11. There is one danger I want to warn you about (although I may have mentioned it elsewhere) into which I have seen persons of prayer fall, especially women, for since we are weaker there is more occasion for what I'm about to say. It is that some have a weak constitution because of a great amount of penance, prayer, and keeping vigil, and even without these; in receiving some",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,23,1,18,21,2,4,1,11,11,10,13,4,3,2,2,2,2,3,0
"726",1577,118,"favor, their nature is overcome. Since they feel some consolation interiorly and a languishing and weakness exteriorly, they think they are experiencing a spiritual sleep (which is a prayer a little more intense than the prayer of quiet) and they let themselves become absorbed. The more they allow this, the more absorbed they become because their nature is further weakened, and they fancy that they are being carried away in rapture. I call it being carried away in foolishness because it amounts to nothing more than wasting time and wearing down one's health. These persons feel nothing through their senses nor do they feel anything concerning God. One person happened to remain eight hours in this state. By sleeping and eating and avoiding so much penance, this person got rid of the stupor, for there was someone who understood her. She had misled both her confessor and other persons, as well as herself -- for she hadn't intended to deceive. I truly believe that the devil was trying to gain ground, and in this instance indeed he was beginning to gain no small amount.
12. It must be understood that when something is truly from God there is no languishing in the soul, even though there may be an interior and exterior languishing, for the soul experiences deep feelings on seeing itself close to God. Nor does the experience last so long, but for a very short while -- although one becomes absorbed again. In such prayer, if the cause of it is not weakness, as I said, the body is not worn down nor is any external feeling produced.
13. For this reason let them take the advice that when they feel this languishing in themselves they tell the prioress and distract themselves from it insofar as they can. The prioress should make them give up so many hours for prayer so that they have only a very few and try to get them to sleep and eat well until their natural strength begins to return, if it has been lost through a lack of food and sleep. If a Sister's nature is so weak that this is not enough, may she believe me that God does not want her to practice anything but the active life, which also must be practiced in monasteries. They should let her get busy with different duties; and always take care that she not have a great deal of solitude, for she would lose her health completely. It will be quite a mortification",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,15,0,10,9,2,0,2,17,10,10,12,7,1,2,6,5,7,0,3
"727",1577,119,"for her; in how she bears this absence is the way the Lord wants to test her love for Him. And He will be pleased to give her strength back after some time. If He doesn't, she will gain through vocal prayer and through obedience and will merit what she would have merited otherwise, and perhaps more.
14. There could also be some persons with such weak heads and imaginations -- and I have known some -- to whom it seems that everything they think about they see. This is very dangerous. Because I shall perhaps treat of it later on, I'll say no more here. I have greatly enlarged upon this dwelling place because it is the one which more souls enter. Since it is, and since the natural and the supernatural are joined in it, the devil can do more harm. In those dwelling places still to be spoken of, the Lord doesn't give him so much leeway. May His Majesty be forever praised, amen. THE FIFTH DWELLING PLACES
 
Contains Four Chapters
CHAPTER 1
 
Begins to deal with how the soul is united to God in prayer. Tells how one discerns whether there is any illusion.
 
1. O Sisters, how can I explain the riches and treasures and delights found in the fifth dwelling places? I believe it would be better not to say anything about these remaining rooms, for there is no way of knowing how to speak of them; neither is the intellect capable of understanding them nor can comparisons help in explaining them; earthly things are too coarse for such a purpose.
Send light from heaven, my Lord, that I might be able to enlighten these Your servants -- for You have been pleased that some of them ordinarily enjoy these delights -- so that they may not be deceived by the devil transforming himself into an angel of light. For all their desires are directed toward pleasing You.
2. And although I have said ""some,"" there are indeed only a few who fail to enter this dwelling place of which I shall now speak. There are various degrees, and for that reason I say that most enter these places. But I believe that only a few will experience some of the things that I will say are in this room. Yet even if souls do no more than reach the door, God is being very merciful to them; although many are called few are chosen. So I say now that all of us who wear this",1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,1,17,0,11,17,5,1,1,14,12,7,17,5,1,9,0,2,1,1,0
"728",1577,120,"holy habit of Carmel are called to prayer and contemplation. This call explains our origin; we are the descendants of men who felt this call, of those holy fathers on Mount Carmel who in such great solitude and contempt for the world sought this treasure, this precious pearl of contemplation that we are speaking about. Yet few of us dispose ourselves that the Lord may communicate it to us. In exterior matters we are proceeding well so that we will reach what is necessary; but in the practice of the virtues that are necessary for arriving at this point we need very, very much and cannot be careless in either small things or great. So, my Sisters, since in some way we can enjoy heaven on earth, be brave in begging the Lord to give us His grace in such a way that nothing will be lacking through our own fault; that He show us the way and strengthen the soul that it may dig until it finds this hidden treasure. The truth is that the treasure lies within our very selves. This is what I would like to know how to explain, if the Lord would enable me to do so.
3. I said ""strengthen the soul"" so that you will understand that bodily strength is not necessary for those to whom God does not give it. He doesn't make it impossible for anyone to buy His riches. He is content if each one gives what he has. Blessed be so great a God. But reflect, daughters, that He doesn't want you to hold on to anything, so that you will be able to enjoy the favors we are speaking of. Whether you have little or much, He wants everything for Himself; and in conformity with what you know you have given you will receive greater or lesser favors. There is no better proof for recognizing whether our prayer has reached union or not.
4. Don't think this union is some kind of dreamy state like the one I mentioned before. I say ""dreamy state"" because it only seems that the soul is asleep; for neither does it really think it is asleep nor does it feel awake. There is no need here to use any technique to suspend the mind since all the faculties are asleep in this state -- and truly asleep -- to the things of the world and to ourselves. As a matter of fact, during the time that the union lasts the soul is",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,3,15,0,4,26,0,2,0,15,7,10,14,9,0,4,2,5,0,0,0
"729",1577,121,"left as though without its senses, for it has no power to think even if it wants to. In loving, if it does love, it doesn't understand how or what it is it loves or what it would want. In sum, it is like one who in every respect has died to the world so as to live more completely in God. Thus the death is a delightful one, an uprooting from the soul of all the operations it can have while being in the body. The death is a delightful one because in truth it seems that in order to dwell more perfectly in God the soul is so separated from the body that I don't even know if it has life enough to breathe. (I was just now thinking about this, and it seems to me that it doesn't -- at least if it does breathe, it is unaware it is doing so.) Nonetheless, its whole intellect would want to be occupied in understanding something of what is felt. And since the soul does not have the energy to attain to this, it is so stunned that, even if consciousness is not completely lost, neither a hand nor a foot stirs, as we say here below when a person is in such a swoon that we think he is dead.
O secrets of God! I would never tire of trying to explain them if I thought I could in some way manage to do so; thus I will say a thousand foolish things in order that I might at times succeed and that we might give great praise to the Lord.
5. I said that this union was not some kind of dreamy state, because even if the experience in the dwelling place that was just mentioned is abundant the soul remains doubtful that it was union. It doubts whether it imagined the experience; whether it was asleep; whether the experience was given by God; or whether the devil transformed himself into an angel of light. It is left with a thousand suspicions. That it has them is good, for, as I have said, even our own nature can sometimes deceive us in that dwelling place. Though there is not so much room for poisonous things to enter, some tiny lizards do enter; since these lizards have slender heads they can poke their heads in anywhere. And even though they do no harm, especially if one pays no attention to them, as I said, they are often a",2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,1,1,12,4,12,15,7,1,1,18,7,15,24,7,0,5,2,10,3,2,0
"730",1577,122,"bother since they are little thoughts proceeding from the imagination and from what I mentioned. But however slender they may be, these little lizards cannot enter this fifth dwelling place; for there is neither imagination, nor memory, nor intellect that can impede this good. And I would dare say that if the prayer is truly that of union with God the devil cannot even enter or do any damage. His Majesty is so joined and united with the essence of the soul that the devil will not approach nor will he even know about this secret. And this is obvious. Since as they say, he doesn't know our mind, he will have less knowledge of something so secret; for God doesn't even entrust this to our own mind. Oh what a great good, a state in which this accursed one does us no harm! Thus the soul is left with such wonderful blessings because God works within it without anyone disturbing Him, not even ourselves. What will He not give, who is so fond of giving and who can give all that He wants?
6. It seems I have left you confused by saying ""if it is union"" and that there are other unions. And indeed how true it is that there are! Even though these unions regard vain things, the devil will use such things to transport us when they are greatly loved. But he doesn't do so in the way God does, or with the delight and satisfaction of soul, or with the peace and joy. This union is above all earthly joys, above all delights, above all consolations, and still more than that. It doesn't matter where those spiritual or earthly joys come from, for the feeling is very different as you will have experienced. I once said that the difference is like that between feeling something on the rough outer covering of the body or in the marrow of the bones. And that was right on the mark, for I don't know how to say it better.
7. It seems to me that you're still not satisfied, for you will think you can be mistaken and that these interior things are something difficult to examine. What was said will be sufficient for anyone who has experienced union. Yet, because the difference between union and the previous experience is great, I want to mention a clear sign by which you will be sure against error or doubts about whether the union is from God. His Majesty has",3,3,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,14,0,13,23,4,1,1,16,8,6,19,10,0,6,3,3,0,1,0
"731",1577,123,"brought it to my memory today, and in my opinion it is the sure sign. In difficult matters even though it seems to me I understand and that I speak the truth I always use this expression ""it seems to me."" For if I am mistaken, I am very much prepared to believe what those who have a great deal of learning say. Even though they have not experienced these things, very learned men have a certain ""I don't know what;"" for since God destines them to give light to His Church, He enlightens them that they might acknowledge a truth when presented with it. And if they do not live a dissipated life but are God's servants, they are never surprised by His grandeurs; they have come to understand well that He can do ever more and more. And, finally, even though some things are not so well explained, these learned men will find other things in their books that will show that these things could take place.
8. I have had a great deal of experience with learned men, and have also had experience with half-learned, fearful ones; these latter cost me dearly. At least I think that anyone who refuses to believe that God can do much more or that He has considered and continues to consider it good sometimes to communicate favors to His creatures, has indeed closed the door to receiving them. Therefore, Sisters, let this never happen to you, but believe that God can do far more and don't turn your attention to whether the ones to whom He grants His favors are good or bad; for His Majesty know this, as I have told you. There is no reason for us to meddle in the matter, but with humility and simplicity of heart we should serve and praise Him for His works and marvels.
9. Well then, to return to the sign that I say is the true one, you now see that God has made this soul a fool with regard to all so as better to impress upon it true wisdom. For during the time of this union it neither sees, nor hears, nor understands, because the union is always short and seems to the soul even much shorter than it probably is. God so places Himself in the interior of that soul that when it returns to itself it can in no way doubt that it was in God and God was in it. This truth remains with it so",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,1,1,13,0,6,23,2,0,0,25,6,5,14,14,2,4,0,1,1,0,0
"732",1577,124,"firmly that even though years go by without God's granting that favor again, the soul can neither forget nor doubt that it was in God and God was in it. This certitude is what matters now, for I shall speak of the effects of this prayer afterward.
10. Now, you will ask me, how did the soul see this truth or understand if it didn't see or understand anything? I don't say that it then saw the truth but that afterward it sees the truth clearly, not because of a vision but because of a certitude remaining in the soul that only God can place there. I know a person who hadn't learned that God was in all things by presence, power, and essence, and through a favor of this kind that God granted her she came to believe it. After asking a half-learned man of the kind I mentioned -- he knew as little as she had known before God enlightened her -- she was told that God was present only by grace. Such was her own conviction that even after this she didn't believe him and asked others who told her the truth, with which she was greatly consoled.
11. Don't be mistaken by thinking that this certitude has to do with a corporal form, as in the case of the bodily presence of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Most Blessed Sacrament even though we do not see Him. Here the matter isn't like that; it concerns only the divinity. How, then, is it that what we do not see leaves this certitude? I don't know; these are His works. But I do know I speak the truth. And I would say that whoever does not receive this certitude does not experience union of the whole soul with God, but union of some faculty, or that he experiences one of the many others kinds of favors God grants souls. In regard to all these favors we have to give up looking for reasons to see how they've come about. Since our intellect cannot understand this union why do we have to make this effort? It's enough for us to see that He who is the cause of it is almighty. Since we have no part at all to play in bringing it about no matter how much effort we put forth, but it is God who does so, let us not desire the capacity to understand this union.
12. Now I recall, in saying that we have no",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,22,0,2,15,1,0,0,17,13,4,8,9,9,5,0,1,0,0,0
"733",1577,125,"part to play, what you have heard the bride say in the Song of Songs: He brought me into the wine cellar (or, placed me there, I believe it says). And it doesn't say that she went. And it says also that she went looking about in every part of the city for her Beloved. I understand this union to be the wine cellar where the Lord wishes to place us when He desires and as He desires. But however great the effort we make to do so, we cannot enter. His Majesty must place us there and enter Himself into the center of our soul. And that He may show His marvels more clearly He doesn't want our will to have any part to play, for it has been entirely surrendered to Him. Neither does He want the door of the faculties and of the senses to be opened, for they are all asleep. But He wants to enter the center of the soul without going through any door, as He entered the place where His disciples were when He said, pax vobis; or as He left the tomb without lifting away the stone. Further on you will see in the last dwelling place how His Majesty desires that the soul enjoy Him in its own center even much more than here.
13. O daughters, how much we shall see if we don't want to have anything more to do with our own lowliness and misery and if we understand that we are unworthy of being servants of a Lord who is so great we cannot comprehend His wonders! May He be forever praised, amen.

CHAPTER 2
 
Continues on the same topic. Explains the prayer of union through an exquisite comparison. Tells about the effects it leaves in the soul. The chapter is very important.
 
1. It will seem to you that everything has already been said about what there is to see in this dwelling place. Yet a lot is missing; for, as I said, there are various degrees of intensity. With regard to the nature of union, I don't believe I'd know how to say anything more. But when souls to whom God grants these favors prepare themselves, there are many things to say about the Lord's work in them. I shall speak of some of these and tell about the state the soul is left in. To explain things better I want to use a helpful comparison; it is good for making us see how, even",1,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,7,2,0,13,1,5,12,3,0,3,12,8,12,14,7,5,13,0,1,0,0,2
"734",1577,126,"though we can do nothing in this work done by our Lord, we can do much by disposing ourselves so that His Majesty may grant us this favor.
2. You must have already heard about His marvels manifested in the way silk originates, for only He could have invented something like that. The silkworms come from seeds about the size of little grains of pepper. (I have never seen this but heard of it, and so if something in the explanation gets distorted it won't be my fault.) When warm weather comes and the leaves begin to appear on the mulberry tree, the seeds start to live, for they are dead until then. The worms nourish themselves on mulberry leaves until, having grown to full size, they settle on some twigs. There with their little mouths they themselves go about spinning the silk and making some very thick little cocoons in which they enclose themselves. The silkworm, which is fat and ugly, then dies, and a little white butterfly, which is very pretty, comes forth from the cocoon. Now if this were not seen but recounted to us as having happened in other times, who would believe it? Or what reasonings could make us conclude that a thing as nonrational as a worm or a bee could be so diligent in working for our benefit and with so much industriousness? And the poor little worm loses its life in the challenge. This is enough, Sisters, for a period of meditation even though I may say no more to you; in it you can consider the wonders and the wisdom of our God. Well now, what would happen if we knew the property of every created thing. It is very beneficial for us to busy ourselves thinking of these grandeurs and delighting in being brides of a King so wise and powerful.
3. Let's return to what I was saying. This silkworm, then, starts to live when by the heat of the Holy Spirit it begins to benefit through the general help given to us all by God and through the remedies left by Him to His Church, by going to confession, reading good books, and hearing sermons, which are the remedies that a soul, dead in its carelessness and sins and placed in the midst of occasions, can make use of. It then begins to live and to sustain itself by these things, and by good meditations, until it is grown. Its being grown is what is relevant to what",3,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,4,0,1,11,3,5,16,0,1,1,9,8,9,14,4,3,5,7,2,2,0,1
"735",1577,127,"I'm saying, for these other things have little importance here.
4. Well once this silkworm is grown -- in the beginning I dealt with its growth -- it begins to spin the silk and build the house wherein it will die. I would like to point out here that this house is Christ. Somewhere, it seems to me, I have read or heard that our life is hidden in Christ or in God (both are the same), or that our life is Christ. Whether the quotation is exact or not doesn't matter for what I intend.
5. Well see here, daughters, what we can do through the help of God: His Majesty Himself, as He does in this prayer of union, becomes the dwelling place we build for ourselves. It seems I'm saying that we can build up God and take Him away since I say that He is the dwelling place and we ourselves can build it so as to place ourselves in it. And, indeed, we can! Not that we can take God away or build Him up, but we can take away from ourselves and build up, as do these little silkworms. For we will not have finished doing all that we can in this work when, to the little we do, which is nothing, God will unite Himself, with His greatness, and give it such high value that the Lord Himself will become the reward of this work. Thus, since it was He who paid the highest price, His Majesty wants to join our little labors with the great ones He suffered so that all the work may become one.
6. Therefore, courage, my daughters! Let's be quick to do this work and weave this little cocoon by getting rid of our self-love and self-will, our attachments to any earthly things, and by performing deeds of penance, prayer, mortification, obedience, and of all the other things you know. Would to heaven that we would do what we know we must; and we are instructed about what we must do. Let it die; let this silkworm die, as it does in completing what it was created to do! And you will see how we see God, as well as ourselves placed inside His greatness, as is this little silkworm within its cocoon. Keep in mind that I say ""see God,"" in the sense of what I mentioned concerning that which is felt in this kind of union.
7. Now, then, let's see what this silkworm does, for that's the",3,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,2,3,15,3,3,12,2,0,1,9,8,6,10,7,5,5,7,0,2,0,0
"736",1577,128,"reason I've said everything else. When the soul is, in this prayer, truly dead to the world, a little white butterfly comes forth. Oh, greatness of God! How transformed the soul is when it comes out of this prayer after having been placed within the greatness of God and so closely joined with Him for a little while -- in my opinion the union never lasts for as much as a half hour. Truly, I tell you that the soul doesn't recognize itself. Look at the difference there is between an ugly worm and a little white butterfly; that's what the difference is here. The soul doesn't know how it could have merited so much good -- from where this good may have come I mean, for it well knows that it doesn't merit this blessing. It sees within itself a desire to praise the Lord; it would want to dissolve and die a thousand deaths for Him. It soon begins to experience a desire to suffer great trials without its being able to do otherwise. There are the strongest desires for penance, for solitude, and that all might know God; and great pain comes to it when it sees that He is offended. I shall treat of these things more particularly in the next dwelling place; although what is in this dwelling place and the next are almost identical, the force of the effects is very different. As I have said, if after God brings a soul here it makes the effort to advance, it will see great things.
8. Oh, now, to see the restlessness of this little butterfly, even though it has never been quieter and calmer in its life, is something to praise God for! And the difficulty is that it doesn't know where to alight and rest. Since it has experienced such wonderful rest, all that it sees on earth displeases it, especially if God gives it this wine often. Almost each time it gains new treasures. It no longer has any esteem for the works it did while a worm, which was to weave the cocoon little by little; it now has wings. How can it be happy walking step by step when it can fly? On account of its desires, everything it can do for God becomes little in its own eyes. It doesn't wonder as much at what the saints suffered now that it understands through experience how the Lord helps and transforms a soul, for it doesn't recognize itself or",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,22,3,9,20,3,2,2,12,9,9,12,8,9,3,0,1,2,0,1
"737",1577,129,"its image. The weakness it previously seemed to have with regard to doing penance it now finds is its strength. Its attachment to relatives or friends or wealth (for neither its actions, nor its determination, nor its desire to withdraw were enough; rather, in its opinion, it was more attached to everything) is now so looked upon that it grieves when obliged to do what is necessary in this regard so as not to offend God. Everything wearies it, for it has learned through experience that creatures cannot give it true rest.
9. It seems I have been lengthy, but I could say much more; and whoever has received this favor from God will see that I've been brief. So, there is no reason to be surprised that this little butterfly seeks rest again since it feels estranged from earthly things. Well then, where will the poor little thing go? It can't return to where it came from; as was said, we are powerless, however much we do, to bring about this favor until God is again pleased to grant it. O Lord, what new trials begin for this soul! Who would say such a thing after a favor so sublime? Briefly, in one way or another, there must be a cross while we live. And with respect to anyone who says that after he arrived here he always enjoyed rest and delight I would say that he never arrived but that perhaps he had experienced some spiritual delight -- if he had entered into the previous dwelling place -- and his experience had been helped along by natural weakness or perhaps even by the devil who gives him peace so as afterward to wage much greater war against him.
10. I don't mean to say that those who arrive here do not have peace; they do have it, and it is very deep. For the trials themselves are so valuable and have such good roots that although very severe they give rise to peace and happiness. From the very unhappiness caused by worldly things arises the ever so painful desire to leave this world. Any relief the soul has comes from the thought that God wants it to be living in this exile; yet even this is not enough, because in spite of all these benefits it is not entirely surrendered to God's will, as will be seen further on -- although it doesn't fail to conform itself. But it conforms with a great feeling that it can do",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,3,11,2,12,25,1,3,3,10,5,9,13,10,4,6,2,0,4,0,0
"738",1577,130,"no more because no more has been given it, and with many tears. Every time it is in prayer this regret is its pain. In some ways perhaps the sorrow proceeds from the deep pain it feels at seeing that God is offended and little esteemed in this world and that many souls are lost, heretics as well as Moors; although those that grieve it most are Christians. Even though it sees that God's mercy is great -- for, however wicked their lives, these Christians can make amends and be saved -- it fears that many are being condemned.
11. Oh, greatness of God! A few years ago -- and even perhaps days -- this soul wasn't mindful of anything but itself. Who has placed it in the midst of such painful concerns? Even were we to meditate for many years we wouldn't be able to feel them as painfully as does this soul now. Well, God help me, wouldn't it be enough if for many days and years I strove to think about the tremendous evil of an offense against God and that those souls who are condemned are His children and my brothers and about the dangers in which we live and how good it is for us to leave this miserable life? Not at all, daughters; the grief that is felt here is not like that of this world. We can, with God's favor, feel the grief that comes from thinking about these things a great deal, but such grief doesn't reach the intimate depths of our being as does the pain suffered in this state, for it seems that the pain breaks and grinds the soul into pieces, without the soul's striving for it or even at times wanting it. Well, what is this pain? Where does it come from? I shall tell you.
12. Haven't you heard it said of the bride -- for I have already mentioned it elsewhere here but not in this sense -- that God brought her into the inner wine cellar and put charity in order within her? Well, that is what I mean. Since that soul now surrenders itself into His hands and its great love makes it so surrendered that it neither knows nor wants anything more than what He wants with her (for God will never, in my judgment, grant this favor save to a soul that He takes for His own), He desires that, without its understanding how, it may go forth from this union impressed",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,20,4,23,15,2,5,10,11,6,8,10,3,2,2,5,1,8,1,1
"739",1577,131,"with His seal. For indeed the soul does no more in this union than does the wax when another impresses a seal on it. The wax doesn't impress the seal upon itself; it is only disposed -- I mean by being soft. And even in order to be disposed, it doesn't soften itself but remains still and gives its consent. Oh, goodness of God; everything must be at a cost to You! All You want is our will and that there be no impediment in the wax.
13. Well now, you see here, Sisters, what our God does in this union so that this soul may recognize itself as His own. He gives from what He has, which is what His Son had in this life. He cannot grant us a higher favor. Who could have had a greater desire to leave this life? And so His Majesty said at the Last Supper: I have earnestly desired.
Well then, how is it Lord, that you weren't thinking of the laborious death You were about to suffer, so painful and frightful? You answer: ""No, my great love and the desire I have that souls be saved are incomparably more important than these sufferings; and the very greatest sorrows that I have suffered and do suffer, after being in the world, are not enough to be considered anything at all in comparison with this love and desire to save souls.""
14. This is true, for I have often reflected on the matter. I know the torment a certain soul of my acquaintance suffers and has suffered at seeing our Lord offended. The pain is so unbearable that she desires to die much more than to suffer it. If a soul with so little charity when compared to Christ's -- for its charity could then be considered almost nonexistent -- felt this torment to be so unbearable, what must have been the feeling of our Lord Jesus Christ? And what kind of life must He have suffered since all things were present to Him and He was always witnessing the serious offenses committed against His Father? I believe without a doubt that these sufferings were much greater than were those of His most sacred Passion. At the time of His Passion He already saw an end to these trials and with this awareness as well as the happiness of seeing a remedy for us in His death and of showing us the love He had for His Father in suffering so much for Him,",4,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,3,14,3,16,20,2,2,9,12,2,12,7,12,4,1,4,0,5,5,1
"740",1577,132,"His sorrows were tempered. These sorrows are also tempered here below by those who with the strength that comes from love perform great penances, for they almost don't feel them; rather they would want to do more and more -- and everything they do seems little to them. Well, what must it have been for His Majesty to find Himself with so excellent an occasion for showing His Father how completely obedient He was to Him, and with love for His neighbor? Oh, great delight, to suffer in doing the will of God! But I consider it so difficult to see the many offenses committed so continually against His Majesty and the many souls going to hell that I believe only one day of that pain would have been sufficient to end many lives; how much more one life, if He had been no more than man.

CHAPTER 3
 
Continues on the same subject. Tells about another kind of union the soul can reach with God's help and of how important love of neighbor is for this union. The chapter is very useful.
 
1. Well now let us get back to our little moth and see something about what God gives it in this state. It must always be understood that one has to strive to go forward in the service of our Lord and in self-knowledge. For if a person does no more than receive this favor and if, as though already securely in possession of something, she grows careless in her life and turns aside from the heavenly path, which consists of keeping the commandments, that which happens to the silkworm will happen to her. For it gives forth the seed that produces other silkworms, and itself dies forever. I say that it gives forth the seed because I hold that it is Gods desire that a favor so great not be given in vain; if a person doesnt herself benefit, the favor will benefit others. For since the soul is left with these desires and virtues that were mentioned, it always brings profit to other souls during the time that it continues to  live virtuously; and they catch fire from its fire. And even when the soul has itself lost this fire, the inclination to benefit others will remain, and the soul delights in explaining the favors God grants to whoever loves and serves Him.
2. I know a person to whom this happened. Although she had gone far astray, she enjoyed helping others through the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,1,14,1,10,29,0,2,4,8,7,12,8,8,2,1,6,0,3,4,0
"741",1577,133,"favors God had granted her and showing the way of prayer to those who didnt understand it; and she did a great deal of good. Afterward the Lord again gave her light. Its true that she still hadnt experienced the effects that were mentioned; but how many there must be, like Judas, whom the Lord calls to the apostolate by communing with them, and like Saul, whom He calls to be king, who afterward through their own fault go astray! Thus we can conclude, Sisters, that, in order to merit more and more and avoid getting lost like such persons, our security lies in obedience and refusal to deviate from Gods law. I'm speaking to those to whom He has granted similar favors, and even to everyone.
3. It seems to me that despite all I've said about this dwelling place, the matter is still somewhat obscure. Since so much gain comes from entering this place, it will be good to avoid giving the impression that those to whom the Lord doesn't give things that are so supernatural are left without hope. True union can very well be reached, with God's help, if we make the effort to obtain it by keeping our wills fixed only on that which is God's will. Oh, how many of us there are who will say we do this, and it will seem to us that we don't want anything else and that we would die for this truth, as I believe I have said! Well I tell you, and I will often repeat it, that if what you say is true you will have obtained this favor from the Lord, and you needn't care at all about the other delightful union that was mentioned. That which is most valuable in the delightful union is that it proceeds from this union of which I'm now speaking; and one cannot arrive at the delightful union if the union coming from being resigned to God's will is not very certain. Oh, how desirable is this union with God's will! Happy the soul that has reached it. Such a soul will live tranquilly in this life, and in the next as well. Nothing in earthly events afflicts it unless it finds itself in some danger of losing God or sees that He is offended: neither sickness, nor poverty, nor death -- unless the death is of someone who will be missed by God's Church -- for this soul sees well that the Lord knows what He",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,19,3,11,30,3,3,4,8,9,9,14,9,2,6,0,0,2,0,0
"742",1577,134,"is doing better than it knows what it is desiring.
4. You must note that there are different kinds of sufferings. Some sufferings are produced suddenly by our human nature, and the same goes for consolations, and even by the charity of compassion for one's neighbor, as our Lord experienced when He raised Lazarus. Being united with God's will doesn't take these experiences away, nor do they disturb the soul with a restless, disquieting passion that lasts a long while. These sufferings pass quickly. As I have said concerning consolations in prayer, it seems they do not reach the soul's depth but only the senses and faculties. They are found in the previous dwelling places; but they do not enter the last ones still to be explained, since the suspension of the faculties is necessary in order to reach these, as has been said. The Lord has the power to enrich souls through many paths and bring them to these dwelling places, without using the short cut that was mentioned.
5. Nonetheless, take careful note, daughters, that it is necessary for the silkworm to die, and, moreover, at a cost to yourselves. In the delightful union, the experience of seeing oneself in so new a life greatly helps one to die; in the other union, it's necessary that, while living in this life, we ourselves put the silkworm to death. I confess this latter death will require a great deal of effort, or more than that; but it has its value. Thus if you come out victorious the reward will be much greater. But there is no reason to doubt the possibility of this death any more than that of true union with the will of God. This union with God's will is the union I have desired all my life; it is the union I ask the Lord for always and the one that is clearest and safest.
6. But alas for us, how few there must be who reach it; although whoever guards himself against offending the Lord and has entered religious life thinks he has done everything! Oh, but there remain some worms, unrecognized until, like those in the story of Jonah that gnawed away the ivy, they have gnawed away the virtues. This happens through self-love, self-esteem, judging one's neighbors (even though in little things), a lack of charity for them, and not loving them as ourselves. For even though, while crawling along, we fulfill our obligation and no sin is committed, we don't advance very far",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,4,0,2,4,13,5,8,16,5,2,0,8,6,6,8,10,1,2,2,0,5,1,0
"743",1577,135,"in what is required for complete union with the will of God.
7. What do you think His will is, daughters? That we be completely perfect. See what we lack to be one with Him and His Father as His Majesty asked. I tell you I am writing this with much pain upon seeing myself so far away -- and all through my own fault. The Lord doesn't have to grant us great delights for this union; sufficient is what He has given us in His Son, who would teach us the way. Don't think the matter lies in my being so conformed to the will of God that if my father or brother dies I don't feel it, or that if there are trials or sicknesses I suffer them happily. Such an attitude is good, and sometimes it's a matter of discretion because we can't do otherwise, and we make a virtue of necessity. How many things like these the philosophers did, or even, though not like these, other things, such as acquiring much learning. Here in our religious life the Lord asks of us only two things: love of His Majesty and love of our neighbor. These are what we must work for. By observing them with perfection, we do His will and so will be united with Him. But how far, as I have said, we are from doing these two things for so great a God as we ought! May it please His Majesty to give us His grace so that we might merit, if we want, to reach this state that lies within our power.
8. The most certain sign, in my opinion, as to whether or not we are observing these two laws is whether we observe well the love of neighbor. We cannot know whether or not we love God, although there are strong indications for recognizing that we do love Him; but we can know whether we love our neighbor. And be certain that the more advanced you see you are in love for your neighbor the more advanced you will be in the love of God, for the love His Majesty has for us is so great that to repay us for our love of neighbor He will in a thousand ways increase the love we have for Him. I cannot doubt this.
9. It's important for us to walk with careful attention to how we are proceeding in this matter, for if we practice love of neighbor with great perfection, we",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,6,0,8,1,6,34,1,2,1,8,5,9,16,9,3,1,1,0,3,12,0
"744",1577,136,"will have done everything. I believe that, since our nature is bad, we will not reach perfection in the love of neighbor if that love doesn't rise from love of God as its root. Since this is so important to us, Sisters, let's try to understand ourselves even in little things, and pay no attention to any big plans that sometimes suddenly come to us during our prayer in which it seems we will do wonders for our neighbor and even for just one soul so that it may be saved. If afterward our deeds are not in conformity with those plans, there will be no reason to believe that we will accomplish the plans. I say the same about humility and all the virtues. Great are the wiles of the devil; to make us think we have one virtue -- when we don't -- he would circle hell a thousand times. And he is right because such a notion is very harmful, for these feigned virtues never come without some vainglory since they rise from that source; just as virtues from God are free of it as well as of pride.
10. I am amused sometimes to see certain souls who think when they are at prayer that they would like to be humiliated and publicly insulted for God, and afterward they would hide a tiny fault if they could; or, if they have not committed one and yet are charged with it -- God deliver us! Well, let anyone who can't bear such a thing be careful not to pay attention to what he has by himself determined -- in his opinion -- to do. As matter of fact the determination was not in the will -- for when there is a true determination of the will it's another matter -- but a work of the imagination; it is in the imagination that the devil produces his wiles and deceits. And with women or unlearned people he can produce a great number, for we don't know how the faculties differ from one another and from the imagination, nor do we know about a thousand other things there are in regard to interior matters. Oh, Sisters, how clearly one sees the degree to which love of neighbor is present in some of you, and how clearly one sees the deficiency in those who lack such perfection! If you were to understand how important this virtue is for us you wouldn't engage in any other study.
11. When I see",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,3,3,11,0,9,28,1,3,0,19,14,11,18,11,5,1,0,0,1,4,0
"745",1577,137,"souls very earnest in trying to understand the prayer they have and very sullen when they are in it -- for it seems they don't dare let their minds move or stir lest a bit of their spiritual delight and devotion be lost -- it makes me realize how little they understand of the way by which union is attained; they think the whole matter lies in these things. No, Sisters, absolutely not; works are what the Lord wants! He desires that if you see a Sister who is sick to whom you can bring some relief, you have compassion on her and not worry about losing this devotion; and that if she is suffering pain, you also feel it; and that, if necessary, you fast so that she might eat -- not so much for her sake as because you know it is your Lord's desire. This is true union with His will, and if you see a person praised, the Lord wants you to be much happier than if you yourself were being praised. This, indeed, is easy, for if you have humility you will feel sorry to see yourself praised. But this happiness that comes when the virtues of the Sisters are known is a very good thing; and when we see some fault in them, it is also a very good thing to be sorry and hide the fault as though it were our own.
12. I have said a lot on this subject elsewhere, because I see, Sisters, that if we fail in love of neighbors we are lost. May it please the Lord that this will never be so; for if you do not fail, I tell you that you shall receive from His Majesty the union that was mentioned. When you see yourselves lacking in this love, even though you have devotion and gratifying experiences that make you think you have reached this stage, and you experience some little suspension in the prayer of quiet (for to some it then appears that everything has been accomplished), believe me you have not reached union. And beg our Lord to give you this perfect love of neighbor. Let His Majesty have a free hand, for He will give you more than you know how to desire because you are striving and making every effort to do what you can about this love. And force your will to do the will of your Sisters in everything even though you may lose your rights; forget your",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,1,2,1,12,0,14,24,1,1,7,12,9,14,19,9,6,2,3,1,2,4,1
"746",1577,138,"own good for their sakes no matter how much resistance your nature puts up; and, when the occasion arises, strive to accept work yourself so as to relieve your neighbor of it. Don't think that it won't cost you anything or that you will find everything done for you. Look at what our Spouse's love for us cost Him; in order to free us from death, He died that most painful death of the cross.

CHAPTER 4
 
Continues with the same subject, explaining further this kind of prayer. Tells how important it is to walk with care because the devil himself uses a great deal of care in trying to make one turn back from what was begun.
 
1. It seems to you have a desire to see what this little moth is doing and where it rests since as was explained it rests neither in spiritual delights nor in earthly consolations. Its flight is higher, and I cannot satisfy your desire until the last dwelling place. May it please God that I then remember or have the time to write of this. About five months have passed since I began, and because my head is in no condition to read over what Ive written, everything will have to continue on without order, and perhaps some things will be said twice. Since this work is for my Sisters, the disorder wont matter much.
2. Nonetheless, I want to explain more to you about what I think this prayer of union is. In accordance with my style, I shall draw a comparison. Later on well say more about this little  butterfly. Although it is always bearing fruit by doing good for itself and for other souls, it never stops to rest, because it fails to find its true repose.
3. Youve already often heard that God espouses souls spiritually. Blessed be His mercy that wants so much to be humbled! And even though the comparison may be a coarse one I cannot find another that would better explain what I mean than the sacrament of marriage. This spiritual espousal is different in kind from marriage, for in these matters that we are dealing with there is never anything that is not spiritual. Corporal things are far distant from them, and the spiritual joys the Lord gives when compared to the delights married people must experience are a thousand leagues distant. For it is all a matter of love united with love, and the actions of love are most pure and so",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,3,15,3,4,22,1,0,1,13,10,6,12,9,2,3,0,1,1,4,1
"747",1577,139,"extremely delicate and gentle that there is no way of explaining them, but the Lord knows how to make them very clearly felt.
4. It seems to me that the prayer of union does not yet reach the stage of spiritual betrothal. Here below when two people are to be engaged, there is a discussion about whether they are alike, whether they love each other, and whether they might meet together so as to become more satisfied with each other. So, too, in the case of this union with God, the agreement has been made, and this soul is well informed about the goodness of her Spouse and determined to do His will in everything and in as many ways as she sees might make Him happy. And His Majesty, as one who understands clearly whether these things about His betrothed are so, is happy with her. As a result He grants this mercy, for He desired her to know Him more and that they might meet together, as they say, and be united. We can say that union is like this, for it passes in a very short time. In it there no longer takes place the exchanging of gifts, but the soul sees secretly who this Spouse is that she is going to accept. Through the work of the senses and the faculties she couldn't in any way or in a thousand years understand what she understands here in the shortest time. But being who He is, the Spouse from that meeting alone leaves her more worthy for the joining of hands, as they say. The soul is left so much in love that it does for its part all it can to avoid disturbing this divine betrothal. But if it is careless about placing its affection in something other than Him, it loses everything. And the loss is as great as the favors He was granting her, and cannot be exaggerated.
5. For this reason, I ask Christian souls whom the Lord has brought to these boundaries that for His sake they not grow careless but withdraw from occasions. Even in this state the soul is not so strong that it can place itself in the occasions as it will be after the betrothal is made. The betrothal belongs to the dwelling place we shall speak of after this one. This present communication amounts to no more than a meeting, as they say. And the devil will go about very carefully in order to fight against and",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,14,0,10,20,3,1,3,14,7,3,8,6,2,5,2,1,0,2,0
"748",1577,140,"prevent this betrothal. Afterward, since he sees the soul entirely surrendered to the Spouse he doesn't dare do so much, because he fears it. He has experienced that if sometimes he tries he is left with a great loss; and the soul, with further gain.
6. I tell you, daughters, that I have known persons who had ascended high and had reached this union, who were turned back and won over by the devil with his deep cunning and deceit. All hell must join for such a purpose because, as I have often said, in losing one soul of this kind, not only one is lost but a multitude. The devil already has experience in this matter. Look at the multitude of souls God draws to Himself by means of one. He is to be greatly praised for the thousands converted by the martyrs: for a young girl like St. Ursula; for those the devil must have lost through St. Dominic, St. Francis, and other founders of religious orders, and those he now loses through Father Ignatius, the one who founded the Society. Clearly, all of these received, as we read, similar favors from God. How would this have come about if they hadn't made the effort not to lose through their own fault so divine an espousal? Oh, my daughters, how prepared this Lord is to grant us favors now just as He has granted them to others in the past. And, in part, He is even more in need that we desire to receive them, for there are fewer now who care about His honor, than there were then. We love ourselves very much; there's an extraordinary amount of prudence we use so as not to lose our rights. Oh, what great deception! May the Lord through His mercy enlighten us so that we do not fall into similar darknesses.
7. You will ask me or be in doubt concerning two things: First, if the soul is as ready to do the will of God as was mentioned, how can it be deceived since it doesn't want to do anything but His will in all? Second, what are the ways in which the devil can enter so dangerously that your soul goes astray? For you are so withdrawn from the world, so close to the sacraments, and in the company, we could say, of angels, and through the Lord's goodness you have no other desire than to serve God and please Him in everything. With those who are",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,23,0,16,14,2,2,7,3,12,11,9,8,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"749",1577,141,"already in the midst of worldly occasions such a turn backward would not be surprising. I say that you are right about this, for God has granted us a great deal of mercy. But when I see, as I have said, that Judas was in the company of the Apostles and conversing always with God Himself and listening to His words, I understand that there is no security in these things.
8. In answer to the first, I say that if this soul were always attached to God's will it is clear that it would not go astray. But the devil comes along with some skilled deception and, under the color of good, confuses it with regard to little things and induces it to get taken up with some of them that he makes it think are good. Then little by little he darkens the intellect, cools the will's ardor, and makes self-love grow until in one way or another he withdraws the soul from the will of God and brings it to his own.
Thus, we have an answer to the second doubt. There is no enclosure so fenced in that he cannot enter, or desert so withdrawn that he fails to go there. And I still have something more to say: perhaps the Lord permits this so as to observe the behavior of that soul He wishes to set up as a light for others. If there is going to be a downfall, it's better that it happen in the beginning rather than later, when it would be harmful to many.
9. The diligence on our part that comes to my mind as being the most effective is the following. First, we must always ask God in prayer to sustain us, and very often think that if He abandons us we will soon end in the abyss, as is true; and we must never trust in ourselves since it would be foolish to do so. Then, we should walk with special care and attention, observing how we are proceeding in the practice of virtue: whether we are getting better or worse in some areas, especially in love for one another, in the desire to be considered the least among the Sisters, and in the performance of ordinary tasks. For if we look out for these things and ask the Lord to enlighten us, we will soon see the gain or the loss. Don't think that a soul that comes so close to God is allowed to lose Him so",1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,16,0,10,14,2,0,4,11,9,14,17,8,4,5,0,0,0,1,0
"750",1577,142,"quickly, that the devil has an easy task. His Majesty would regret the loss of this soul so much that He gives it in many ways a thousand interior warnings, so that the harm will not be hidden from it.
10. Let this, in sum, be the conclusion: that we strive always to advance. And if we don't advance, let us walk with great fear. Without doubt the devil wants to cause some lapse, for it is not possible that after having come so far, one will fail to grow. Love is never idle, and a failure to grow would be a very bad sign. A soul that has tried to be the betrothed of God Himself, that is now intimate with His Majesty, and has reached the boundaries that were mentioned, must not go to sleep.
That you, daughters, may see what He does with those He now considers to be His betrothed ones, we shall begin to speak of the sixth dwelling places. And you will see how little it all is that we can do to serve and suffer and accomplish so as to dispose ourselves for such great favors. It could be that our Lord ordained that they command me to write so that we might forget our little earthly joys because we will have our eyes set on the reward and see how immeasurable is His mercy -- since He desires to commune with and reveal Himself to some worms -- and because we will have these eyes set also on His greatness, and thus run along enkindled in His love.
11. May He be pleased that I manage to explain something about these very difficult things. I know well that this will be impossible if His Majesty and the Holy Spirit do not move my pen. And if what I say will not be for your benefit, I beg Him that I may not succeed in saying anything. His Majesty knows that I have no other desire, insofar as I can understand myself, but that His name be praised and that we strive to serve a Lord who even here on earth pays like this. Through His favors we can understand something of what He will give us in heaven without the intervals, trials, and dangers that there are in this tempestuous sea. If there were no danger of losing or offending Him, it would be easy to endure life until the end of the world so as to labor for so great a God",2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,0,1,13,0,17,18,3,3,6,8,7,14,16,4,5,3,0,3,1,2,0

May it please His Majesty that we may merit to render Him some service; without as many faults as we always have, even in good works, amen. THE SIXTH DWELLING PLACES
 
Contains Eleven Chapters
CHAPTER 1
 
Discusses how greater trials come when the Lord begins to grant greater favors. Mentions some and how those who are now in this dwelling place conduct themselves. This chapter is good for souls undergoing interior trials.
 
1. Well then, let us, with the help of the Holy Spirit, speak of the sixth dwelling places, where the soul is now wounded with love for its Spouse and strives for more opportunities to be alone and, in conformity with its state, to rid itself of everything that can be an obstacle to this solitude.
That meeting left such an impression that the soul's whole desire is to enjoy it again. I have already said that in this prayer nothing is seen in a way that can be called seeing, nor is anything seen with the imagination. I use the term ""meeting"" because of the comparison I made. Now the soul is fully determined to take no other spouse. But the Spouse does not look at the soul's great desires that the betrothal take place, for He still wants it to desire this more, and He wants the betrothal to take place at a cost; it is the greatest of blessings. And although everything is small when it comes to paying for this exceptional benefit, I tell you, daughters, that for the soul to endure such delay it needs to have that token or pledge of betrothal that it now has. Oh, God help me, what interior and exterior trials the soul suffers before entering the seventh dwelling place!
2. Indeed, sometimes I reflect and fear that if a soul knew beforehand, its natural weakness would find it most difficult to have the determination to suffer and pass through these trials, no matter what blessings were represented to it -- unless it had arrived at the seventh dwelling place. For once it has arrived there, the soul fears nothing and is absolutely determined to overcome every obstacle for God. And the reason is that it is always so closely joined to His Majesty that from this union comes its fortitude. I believe it will be well to recount some of those trials that I know one will certainly undergo. Perhaps not all souls will be led along this path, although I doubt very much that",3,2,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,0,2,18,0,14,19,8,0,3,10,7,8,12,9,4,2,0,0,2,1,0
"752",1577,144,"those persons who sometimes enjoy so truly the things of heaven will live free of earthly trials that come in one way or another.
3. Although I hadn't intended to treat of these, I thought doing so would bring great consolation to some soul going through them, for it would learn that these trials take place in souls to whom God grants similar favors; for truly, when one is suffering the trials, it then seems that everything is lost. I will not deal with them according to the order in which they happen, but as they come to mind. And I want to begin with the smallest trials. There is an outcry by persons a Sister is dealing with and even by those she does not deal with and who, it seems to her, would never even think of her; gossip like the following: ""she's trying to make out she's a saint; she goes to extremes to deceive the world and bring others to ruin; there are other better Christians who don't put on all this outward show."" (And it's worth noting that she is not putting on any outward show but just striving to fulfill well her state in life.) Those she considered her friends turn away from her, and they are the ones who take the largest and most painful bite at her: ""that soul has gone astray and is clearly mistaken; these are things of the devil; she will turn out like this person or that other that went astray, and will bring about a decline in virtue; she has deceived her confessors"" (and they go to these confessors, telling them so, giving them examples of what happened to some that were lost in this way); a thousand kinds of ridicule and statements like the above.
4. I know a person who had great fear that there would be no one who would hear her confession because of such gossip -- so much gossip that there's no reason to go into it all here. And what is worse these things do not pass quickly, but go on throughout the person's whole life including the advice to others to avoid any dealings with such persons.
You will tell me that there are also those who will speak well of that soul. Oh, daughters, how few there are who believe in such favors in comparison with the many who abhor them! Moreover, praise is just another trial greater than those mentioned! Since the soul sees clearly that if it has",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,2,14,0,14,20,2,1,4,13,6,8,11,8,1,2,0,0,3,0,0
"753",1577,145,"anything good this is given by God and is by no means its own -- for just previously it saw itself to be very poor and surrounded by great sins -- praise is an intolerable burden to it, at least in the beginning. Later on, for certain reasons, praise is not so intolerable. First, because experience makes the soul see clearly that people are as quick to say good things as bad, and so it pays no more attention to the good things than to the bad. Second, because it has been more enlightened by the Lord that no good thing comes from itself but is given by His Majesty; and it turns to praise God, forgetful that it has had any part to play, just as if it had seen the gift in another person. Third, if it sees that some souls have benefited from seeing the favors God grants it, it thinks that His Majesty used this means, of its being falsely esteemed as for good, so that some blessings might come to those souls. Fourth, since it looks after the honor and glory of God more than its own, the temptation, which came in the beginning, that these praises will destroy it, is removed; little does dishonor matter to it if in exchange God might perhaps thereby just once be praised -- afterward, let whatever comes come.
5. These reasons and others mitigate the great pain these praises cause; although some pain is almost always felt, except when one is paying hardly any attention. But it is an incomparably greater trial to see oneself publicly considered as good without reason than the trials mentioned. And when the soul reaches the stage at which it pays little attention to praise, it pays much less to disapproval; on the contrary, it rejoices in this and finds it a very sweet music. This is an amazing truth. Blame does not intimidate the soul but strengthens it. Experience has already taught it the wonderful gain that comes through this path. It feels that those who persecute it do not offend God; rather that His Majesty permits persecution for the benefit of the soul. And since it clearly experiences the benefits of persecution, it acquires a special and very tender love for its persecutors. It seems to it that they are greater friends and more advantageous than those who speak well of it.
6. The Lord is wont also to send it the severest illnesses. This is a much greater trial, especially",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,0,6,24,0,11,34,0,4,0,15,11,4,15,5,7,3,2,0,4,1,0
"754",1577,146,"when the pains are acute. For in some way, if these pains are severe, the trial is, it seems to me, the greatest on earth -- I mean the greatest exterior trial, however many the other pains. I say ""if the pains are severe,"" because they then afflict the soul interiorly and exteriorly in such a way that it doesn't know what to do with itself. It would willingly accept at once any martyrdom rather than these sharp pains; although they do not last long in this extreme form. After all, God gives no more than what can be endured; and His Majesty gives patience first. But other great sufferings and illnesses of many kinds are the usual thing.
7. I know a person who cannot truthfully say that from the time the Lord began forty years ago to grant the favor that was mentioned she spent even one day without pains and other kinds of suffering (the lack of bodily health, I mean) and other great trials. It's true that she had been very wretched and that everything seemed small to her in comparison with the hell she deserved. Others, who have not offended our Lord so much, will be led by another path. But I would always choose the path of suffering, if only to imitate our Lord Jesus Christ if there were no other gain; especially, since there are always so many other benefits.
Oh, were we to treat of interior sufferings these others would seem small if the interior ones could be clearly explained; but it is impossible to explain the way in which they come to pass.
8. Let us begin with the torment one meets with from a confessor who is so discreet and has so little experience that there is nothing he is sure of: he fears everything and finds in everything something to doubt because he sees these unusual experiences. He becomes especially doubtful if he notices some imperfection in a soul that has them, for it seems to such confessors that the ones to whom God grants these favors must be angels -- but that is impossible as long as they are in this body. Everything is immediately condemned as from the devil or melancholy. And the world is so full of this melancholy that I am not surprised. There is so much of it now in the world, and the devil causes so many evils through this means, that confessors are very right in fearing it and considering it carefully. But",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,16,0,21,12,4,3,4,20,5,15,17,12,1,2,1,2,8,0,0
"755",1577,147,"the poor soul that walks with the same fear and goes to its confessor as to its judge, and is condemned by him, cannot help but be deeply tormented and disturbed. Only the one who has passed through this will understand what a great torment it is. For this is another one of the terrible trials these souls suffer, especially if they have lived wretched lives; thinking that because of their sins God will allow them to be deceived. Even though they feel secure and cannot believe that the favor when granted by His Majesty, is from any other spirit than from God, the torment returns immediately since the favor is something that passes quickly, and the remembrance of sins is always present, and the soul sees faults in itself, which are never lacking. When the confessor assures it, the soul grows calm, although the disturbance will return. But when the confessor contributes to the torment with more fear, the trial becomes something almost unbearable -- especially when some dryness comes between the times of these favors. It then seems to the soul that it has never been mindful of God and never will be; and when it hears His Majesty spoken of, it seems to it as though it were hearing about a person far away.
9. All this would amount to nothing if it were not for the fact that in addition comes the feeling that it is incapable of explaining things to its confessors, that it has deceived them. And even though it thinks and sees that it tells its confessors about every stirring, even the first ones, this doesn't help. The soul's understanding is so darkened that it becomes incapable of seeing the truth and believes whatever the imagination represents to it (for the imagination is then its master) or whatever foolish things the devil wants to represent. The Lord, it seems, gives the devil license so that the soul might be tried and even be made to think it is rejected by God. Many are the things that war against it with an interior oppression so keen and unbearable that I don't know what to compare this experience to if not to the oppression of those that suffer in hell, for no consolation is allowed in the midst of this tempest. If they desire to be consoled by their confessor, it seems the devils assist him to torment it more. Thus, when a confessor was dealing with a person after she had suffered this",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,25,1,18,9,4,2,4,27,6,8,15,9,3,3,3,0,0,0,0
"756",1577,148,"torment (for it seems a dangerous affliction since there are so many things involved in it), he told her to let him know when she was in this state; but the torment was always so bad that he came to realize there was nothing he could do about it. Well, then, if a person in this state who knows how to read well takes up a book in the vernacular, he will find that he understands no more of it then if he didn't know how to read even one of the letters, for the intellect is incapable of understanding.
10. In sum, there is no remedy in this tempest but to wait for the mercy of God. For at an unexpected time, with one word alone or a chance happening, He so quickly calms the storm that it seems there had not been even as much as a cloud in that soul, and it remains filled with sunlight and much more consolation. And like one who has escaped from a dangerous battle and been victorious, it comes out praising our Lord; for it was He who fought for the victory. It knows very clearly that it did not fight, for all the weapons with which it could have defended itself are seen to be, it seems, in the hands of its enemies. Thus, it knows clearly its wretchedness and the very little we of ourselves can do if the Lord abandons us.
11. It seems the soul has no longer any need of reflection to understand this, for the experience of having suffered through it, having seen itself totally incapacitated, made it understand our nothingness and what miserable things we are. For in this state grace is so hidden (even though the soul must not be without grace since with all this torment it doesn't offend God nor would it offend Him for anything on earth) that not even a very tiny spark is visible. The soul doesn't think that it has any love of God or that it ever had any, for if it has done some good, or His Majesty has granted it some favor, all of this seems to have been dreamed up or fancied. As for sins, it sees certainly that it has committed them.
12. O Jesus, and what a thing it is to see this kind of forsaken soul; and, as I have said, what little help any earthly consolation is for it! Hence, do not think, Sisters, if at some time you find",2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,4,0,0,14,0,15,12,1,9,4,20,7,10,23,11,5,1,1,1,0,1,0
"757",1577,149,"yourselves in this state, that the rich and those who are free will have a better remedy for these times of suffering. Absolutely not, for being rich in this case seems to me like the situation of a person condemned to die who has all the world's delights placed before him. These delights would not be sufficient to alleviate his suffering; rather, they would increase the torment. So it is with this torment; it comes from above, and earthly things are of no avail in the matter. Our great God wants us to know our own misery and that He is king; and this is very important for what lies ahead.
13. Well then, what will this poor soul do when the torment goes on for many days? If it prays, it feels as though it hasn't prayed -- as far as consolation goes, I mean. For consolation is not admitted into the soul's interior, nor is what one recites to oneself, even though vocal, understood. As for mental prayer, this definitely is not the time for that, because the faculties are incapable of the practice; rather, solitude causes greater harm -- and also another torment for this soul is that it be with anyone or that others speak to it. And thus however much it forces itself not to do so, it goes about with a gloomy and ill-tempered mien that is externally very noticeable.
Is it true that it will know how to explain its experiences? They are indescribable, for they are spiritual afflictions and sufferings that one cannot name. The best remedy (I don't mean for getting rid of them, because I don't find any, but so that they may be endured) is to engage in external works of charity and to hope in the mercy of God who never fails those who hope in Him. May He be forever blessed, amen.
14. Other exterior trials the devils cause must be quite unusual; and so there's no reason to speak of them. Nor they, for the most part, so painful; for, however much the devils do, they do not, in my opinion, manage to disable the faculties or disturb the soul in this way. In sum, theres reason for thinking that they can do no more than what the Lord allows them to do; and provided one doesnt lose ones mind, everything is small in comparison with what was mentioned.
15. We shall be speaking in these dwelling places of other interior sufferings, and dealing with different kinds of",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,0,5,15,1,13,18,3,1,6,14,10,9,13,8,0,3,1,0,1,0,0
"758",1577,150,"prayer and favors from the Lord. For even though some favors cause still more severe suffering than those mentioned, as will be seen from the condition in which the body is left, they do not deserve to be called trials. Nor is there any reason for us to write of them since they are such great favors from the Lord. In the midst of receiving them the soul understands that they are great favors and far beyond its merits. This severe suffering comes so that one may enter the seventh dwelling place. It comes along with many other sufferings, only some of which I shall speak of  because it would be impossible to speak of them all, or even to explain what they are; for they are of a different, much higher level than those mentioned in this chapter. And if I havent been able to explain any more than I did about those of a lower kind, less will I be able to say of the others. May the Lord give His help for everything through the merits of His Son, amen. 

CHAPTER 2
 
Deals with some of the ways in which our Lord awakens the soul. It seems there is nothing in these awakenings to fear even though the experience is sublime and the favors are great.
 
1. Seemingly we have left the little moth far behind; but we have not, for these are the trials that make it fly still higher. Well let us begin, then, to discuss the manner in which the Spouse deals with it and how before He belongs to it completely He makes it desire Him vehemently by certain delicate means the soul itself does not understand. (Nor do I believe I'll be successful in explaining them save to those who have experienced them). These are impulses so delicate and refined, for they proceed from very deep within the interior part of the soul, that I don't know any comparison that will fit.
2. They are far different from all that we can acquire of ourselves here below and even from the spiritual delights that were mentioned. For often when a person is distracted and forgetful of God, His Majesty will awaken it. His action is as quick as a falling comet. And as clearly as it hears a thunderclap, even though no sound is heard, the soul understands that it was called by God. So well does it understand that sometimes, especially in the beginning, it is made to tremble",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,14,0,9,18,4,0,3,13,8,4,14,6,1,7,0,1,0,0,0
"759",1577,151,"and even complain without there being anything that causes it pain. It feels that it is wounded in the most exquisite way, but it doesn't learn how or by whom it was wounded. It knows clearly that the wound is something precious, and it would never want to be cured. It complains to its Spouse with words of love, even outwardly, without being able to do otherwise. It knows that He is present, but He doesn't want to reveal the manner in which He allows Himself to be enjoyed. And the pain is great, although delightful and sweet. And even if the soul does not want this wound, the wound cannot be avoided. But the soul, in fact, would never want to be deprived of this pain. The wound satisfies it much more than the delightful and painless absorption of the prayer of quiet.
3. I am struggling, Sisters, to explain for you this action of love, and I don't know how. For it seems a contradiction that the Beloved would give the soul clear understanding that He is with it and yet make it think that He is calling it by a sign so certain that no room is left for doubt and a whisper so penetrating that the soul cannot help but hear it. For it seems that when the Spouse, who is in the seventh dwelling place, communicates in this manner (for the words are not spoken), all the people in the other dwelling places keep still; neither the senses, nor the imagination, nor the faculties stir.
O my powerful God, how sublime are your secrets, and how different spiritual things are from all that is visible and understandable here below. There is nothing that serves to explain this favor, even though the favor is a very small one when compared to the very great ones You work in souls.
4. This action of love is so powerful that the soul dissolves with desire, and yet it doesn't know what to ask for since clearly it thinks that its God is with it.
You will ask me: Well, if it knows this, what does it desire or what pains it? What greater good does it want? I don't know. I do know that it seems this pain reaches to the soul's very depths and that when He who wounds it draws out the arrow, it indeed seems, in accord with the deep love the soul feels, that God is drawing these very depths after Him. I was thinking now",0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,0,3,0,1,0,12,0,14,19,5,1,1,25,8,12,12,10,0,4,2,0,13,4,0
"760",1577,152,"that it's as though, from this fire enkindled in the brazier that is my God, a spark leapt forth and so struck the soul that the flaming fire was felt by it. And since the spark was not enough to set the soul on fire, and the fire is so delightful, the soul is left with that pain; but the spark merely by touching the soul produces that effect. It seems to me this is the best comparison I have come up with. This delightful pain -- and it is not pain -- is not continuous, although sometimes it lasts a long while; at other times it goes away quickly. This depends on the way the Lord wishes to communicate it, for it is not something that can be produced in any human way. But even though it sometimes lasts for a long while, it comes and goes. To sum up, it is never permanent. For this reason it doesn't set the soul on fire; but just as the fire is about to start, the spark goes out and the soul is left with the desire to suffer again that loving pain the spark causes.
5. Here there is no reason to wonder whether the experience is brought on naturally or caused by melancholy, or whether it is some trick of the devil or some illusion. It is something that leaves clear understanding of how this activity comes from the place where the Lord who is unchanging dwells. The activity is not like that found in other feelings of devotion, where the great absorption in delight can make us doubtful. Here all the senses and faculties remain free of any absorption, wondering what this could be, without hindering anything or being able, in my opinion, to increase or take away that delightful pain.
Anyone to whom our Lord may have granted this favor -- for if He has, that fact will be recognized on reading this -- should thank Him very much. Such a person doesn't have to fear deception. Let his great fear be that he might prove ungrateful for so generous a favor, and let him strive to better his entire life, and to serve, and he will see the results and how he receives more and more. In fact, I know a person who received this favor for some years and was so pleased with it that had she served the Lord through severe trials for a great number of years she would have felt well repaid",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,12,0,16,20,4,1,2,15,13,6,25,7,1,0,10,0,7,0,0
"761",1577,153,"by it. May He be blessed forever, amen.
6. You may wonder why greater security is present in this favor than in other things. In my opinion, these are the reasons: First, the devil never gives delightful pain like this. He can give the savor and delight that seem to be spiritual, but he doesn't have the power to join pain -- and so much of it -- to the spiritual quiet and delight of the soul. For all of his powers are on the outside, and the pains he causes are never, in my opinion, delightful or peaceful, but disturbing and contentious. Second, this delightful tempest comes from a region other than those regions of which he can be lord. Third, the favor brings wonderful benefits to the soul, the more customary of which are the determination to suffer for God, the desire to have many trials, and the determination to withdraw from earthly satisfactions and conversations and other similar things.
7. That this favor is no fancy is very clear. Although at other times the soul may strive to experience this favor, it will not be able to counterfeit one. And the favor is something so manifest that it can in no way be fancied. I mean, one cannot think it is imagined, when it is not, or have doubts about it. If some doubt should remain, one must realize that the things experienced are not true impulses; I mean if there should be doubt about whether the favor was experienced or not. The favor is felt as clearly as a loud voice is heard. There's no basis for thinking it is caused by melancholy, because melancholy does not produce or fabricate its fancies save in the imagination. This favor proceeds from the interior part of the soul.
Now it could be that I'm mistaken, but until I hear other reasons from someone who understands the experience I will always have this opinion. And so I know a person who was quite fearful about being deceived but who never had any fear of this prayer.
8. The Lord also has other ways of awakening the soul: unexpectedly, when it is praying vocally and not thinking of anything interior, it seems a delightful enkindling will come upon it as though a fragrance were suddenly to become so powerful as to spread through all the senses. (I don't say that it is a fragrance but am merely making this comparison.) Or the experience is something like this, and it is communicated only",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,15,0,14,26,6,0,3,20,9,8,26,11,0,6,1,0,3,0,0
"762",1577,154,"for the sake of making one feel the Spouse's presence there. The soul is moved with a delightful desire to enjoy Him, and thereby it is prepared to make intense acts of love and praise of our Lord. This favor rises out of that place I mentioned; but there is nothing in it that causes pain, nor are the desires themselves to enjoy God painful. Such is the way the soul usually experiences it. Neither does it seem to me, for some of the reasons mentioned, there is anything to fear; but one should try to receive this favor with gratitude.

CHAPTER 3
 
Deals with the same subject and tells of the manner in which God, when pleased, speaks to the soul. Gives counsel about how one should behave in such a matter and not follow one's own opinion. Sets down some signs for discerning when there is deception and when not. This chapter is very beneficial.
 
1. God has another way of awakening the soul. Although it somehow seems to be a greater favor than those mentioned, it can be more dangerous, and therefore I shall pause a little to consider it. There are many kinds of locutions given to the soul. Some seem to come from outside oneself; others, from deep within the interior part of the soul; others, from the superior part; and some are so exterior that they come through the sense of hearing, for it seems there is a spoken word. Sometimes, and often, the locution can be an illusion, especially in persons with a weak imagination or in those who are melancholic, I mean who suffer noticeably from melancholy.
2. In my opinion no attention should be paid to these latter two kinds of persons even if they say they see and hear and understand. But neither should one disturb these persons by telling them their locutions come from the devil; one must listen to them as to sick persons. The prioress or confessor to whom they relate their locutions should tell them to pay no attention to such experiences, that these locutions are not essential to the service of God, and that the devil has deceived many by such means, even though this particular person, perhaps, may not be suffering such deception. This counsel should be given so as not to aggravate the melancholy, for if they tell her the locution is due to melancholy, there will be no end to the matter; she will swear that she sees and hears, for it",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,15,0,15,12,2,2,6,18,7,11,21,2,2,7,1,0,4,1,0
"763",1577,155,"seems to her that she does.
3. It is true that it's necessary to be firm in taking prayer away from her and to insist strongly that she pay no attention to locutions; for the devil is wont to profit from these souls that are sick in this way, even though what he does may not be to their harm but to the harm of others. But for both the sick and the healthy there is always reason to fear these things until the spirit of such persons is well understood. And I say that in the beginning it is always better to free these persons from such experiences, for if the locutions are from God, doing so is a greater help toward progress, and a person even grows when tested. This is true; nonetheless, one should not proceed in a way that is distressing or disturbing to a soul, because truly the soul can't help it if these locutions come.
4. Now then, to return to what I was saying about locutions, all the kinds I mentioned can be from God or from the devil or from one's own imagination. If I can manage to do so, I shall give, with the help of the Lord, the signs as to when they come from these different sources and when they are dangerous; for there are many souls among prayerful people who hear them. My desire, Sisters, is that you realize you are doing the right thing if you refuse to give credence to them, even when they are destined just for you (such as, some consolation, or advise about your faults), no matter who tells you about them, or if they are an illusion, for it doesn't matter where they come from. One thing I advice you: do not think, even if the locutions are from God, that you are better because of them, for He spoke frequently with the Pharisees. All the good comes from how one benefits by these words; and pay no more attention to those that are not in close conformity with Scripture than you would to those heard from the devil himself. Even if they come from your weak imagination, it's necessary to treat them as if they were temptations in matters of faith, and thus resist them always. They will then go away because they will have little effect on you.
5. Returning, then, to the first of the different kinds of locutions; whether or not the words come from the interior part of",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,4,16,0,11,13,3,1,0,10,8,11,17,10,0,5,0,0,4,0,0
"764",1577,156,"the soul, from the superior part, or from the exterior part doesn't matter in discerning whether or not they are from God. The surest signs they are from God that can be had, in my opinion, are these: the first and truest is the power and authority they bear, for locutions from God effect what they say. Let me explain myself better. A soul finds itself in the midst of all the tribulation and disturbance that was mentioned, in darkness of the intellect and in dryness; with one word alone of these locutions from the Lord (""don't be distressed""), it is left calm and free from all distress, with great light, and without all that suffering in which it seemed to it that all the learned men and all who might come together to give it reasons for not being distressed would be unable to remove its affliction no matter how hard they tried. Or, it is afflicted because its confessor and others have told it that its spirit is from the devil, and it is all full of fear; with one word alone (""it is I, fear not""), the fear is taken way completely, and the soul is most comforted, thinking that nothing would be sufficient to make it believe anything else. Or, it is greatly distressed over how certain serious business matters will turn out; it hears that it should be calm, that everything will turn out all right. It is left certain and free of anxiety. And this is the way in many other instances.
6. The second sign is the great quiet left in the soul, the devout and peaceful recollection, the readiness to engage in the praises of God. O Lord, if a word sent to be spoken through one of Your attendants (for the Lord Himself does not speak the words -- at least not in this dwelling place -- but an angel) has such power, what will be the power You leave in the soul that is attached to You, and You to it, through love?
7. The third sign is that these words remain in the memory for a very long time, and some are never forgotten, as are those we listen to here on earth -- I mean those we hear from men. For even if the words are spoken by men who are very important and learned, or concern the future, we do not have them engraved on our memory, or believe them, as we do these. The certitude is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,17,0,15,20,10,0,3,16,6,5,14,14,0,8,2,0,0,1,0
"765",1577,157,"so strong that even in things that in one's own opinion sometimes seem impossible and in which there is doubt as to whether they will or will not happen, and the intellect wavers, there is an assurance in the soul itself that cannot be overcome. Even though it seems that everything is going contrary to what the soul understood, and years go by, the thought remains that God will find other means than those men know of and that in the end the words will be accomplished; and so they are. Although, as I say, the soul still suffers when it sees the many delays, for since time has passed since it heard the words, and the effects and the certitude that were present about their being from God have passed, these doubts take place. The soul wonders whether the locutions might have come from the devil or from the imagination. Yet, none of these doubts remain in the soul, but it would at present die a thousand deaths for that truth. But, as I say, what won't the devil do with all these imaginings so as to afflict and intimidate the soul, especially if the words regard a business matter which when carried out will bring many blessings to souls, and works that will bring great honor and service to God, and if there is great difficulty involved? At least he weakens faith, for it does great harm not to believe that God has the power to do things that our intellects do not understand.
8. Despite all these struggles and even the persons who tell one that the locutions are foolishness (I mean the confessors with whom one speaks about these things), and despite the many unfortunate occurrences that make it seem the words will not be fulfilled, there remains a spark of assurance so alive -- I don't know from where -- that the words will be fulfilled, though all other hopes are dead, that even should the soul desire otherwise, that spark will stay alive. And in the end, as I have said, the words of the Lord are fulfilled. And the soul is so consoled and happy it wouldn't want to do anything but always praise His Majesty, and praise Him more for the fact that what He had told it was fulfilled than for the work itself, no matter how important the work is to the soul.
9. I don't know why it is so important to the soul that these words turn out",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,23,5,13,18,4,1,1,18,6,9,16,9,1,5,0,0,3,0,0
"766",1577,158,"to be true, for if that soul were itself caught in some lies, I don't think it would regret the fact as much. And yet, there is nothing else it can do, for it merely says what it hears. Countless times, in this regard, a certain person thought of how the prophet Jonah feared that Nineveh would not be destroyed. In sum, since the spirit is from God, it is right that the soul be faithful in its desire that the words be considered true, for God is the supreme truth. And so its happiness is great when through a thousand roundabout ways and in most difficult circumstances it sees them fulfilled. Even though great trials should come to the person herself from them, she would rather suffer such trials than the trial of seeing that what she knows for certain the Lord told her fails in fact to happen. Perhaps not all persons will have this weakness -- if it is a weakness, for I cannot condemn it as bad.
10. If the locutions come from the imagination, there are none of these signs; neither certitude, nor peace, nor interior delight. But it could happen -- and I even know some persons to whom it has happened -- that while these imaginings come a person may be very absorbed in the prayer of quiet and spiritual sleep. Some have such a weak constitution and imagination, or I don't know the cause, that indeed in this deep recollection they are so outside themselves (for they don't feel anything exteriorly and all the senses are put to sleep) that they think as when they are asleep and dreaming (and perhaps it is true that they are asleep) that these locutions are spoken to them and even that they see things. And they think these things are from God, but in the end the effects are like those of sleep. It can also happen that while with affection they are begging our Lord for something, they think the locution is telling them what they want to hear; this sometimes happens. But anyone who has had much experience of God's locutions will not be deceived by these that come, in my opinion, from the imagination.
11. With those locutions coming from the devil there is more to fear. But if the signs mentioned are present, there can be a great deal of certainty that the locutions are from God. But the certainty shouldn't be so strong that if the locution concerns something serious",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,15,0,14,19,2,2,3,17,4,15,19,13,4,5,2,5,3,0,0
"767",1577,159,"about oneself and has to be carried out in deed, or business affairs involving third parties, anything should ever be done or pass through one's mind without the opinion of a learned and prudent confessor and servant of God. This is so even if the soul increasingly understands and thinks the locution is clearly from God. His Majesty wants the soul to consult in this way; and that it does so does not mean it is failing to carry out the Lord's commands, for He told us, where the words are undoubtedly His, to hold the confessor in His place. And these words of His help to give courage if the task is a difficult one, and our Lord when He so desires will make the confessor believe that the locution comes from His spirit. If He doesn't, the confessor and the soul are no longer under obligation. To do otherwise and follow nothing but your own opinion in this, I hold to be very dangerous. And so, Sisters, I warn you, on the part of our Lord, that you never let this happen to you.
12. There is another way in which the Lord speaks to the soul -- for I hold that it is very definitely from Him -- with a certain intellectual vision, the nature of which I will explain further on. The locution takes place in such intimate depths and a person with the ears of the soul seems to hear those words from the Lord Himself so clearly and so in secret that this very way in which they are heard, together with the acts that the vision itself produces, assures that person and gives him certitude that the devil can have no part to play in the locution. Wonderful effects are left so that the soul may believe; at least there is assurance that the locution doesn't come from the imagination. Furthermore, if the soul is attentive, it can always have assurance for the following reasons: First, there is a difference because of the clarity of the locution. It is so clear that the soul remembers every syllable and whether it is said in one style or another, even if it is a whole sentence. But in a locution fancied by the imagination the words will not be so clear or distinct but like something half-dreamed.
13. Second, in these locutions one often is not thinking about what is heard (I mean that the locution comes unexpectedly and even sometimes while one is in",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,2,0,1,21,0,4,11,0,1,1,21,5,8,17,15,0,6,0,1,0,0,0
"768",1577,160,"conversation), although many times it is a response to what passes quickly through the mind or to what did so previously. But it often refers to things about the future that never entered the mind, and so the imagination couldn't have fabricated it in such a way that the soul could be deceived in fancying what was not desired or wanted or thought of.
14. Third, the one locution comes as in the case of a person who hears, and that of the imagination comes as in the case of a person who gradually composes what he himself wants to be told.
15. Fourth, the words are very different, and with one of them much is comprehended. Our intellect could not compose them so quickly.
16. Fifth, together with the words, in a way I wouldn't know how to explain, there is often given much more to understand than is ever dreamed possible without words.
I shall speak more about this mode of understanding elsewhere, for it is something very delicate and to the praise of our Lord. For in regard to these different kinds of locutions, there have been persons who were very doubtful and unable to understand themselves. A certain person, especially, experienced this doubt, and so there will be others. And thus I know that she observed the differences with close attention because the Lord has often granted her this favor, and the greatest doubt she had in the beginning was whether she had imagined the locution. That the words come from the devil can be more quickly understood; even though his wiles are so many, for he knows well how to counterfeit the Spirit of light. In my opinion the devil will say the words very clearly so that there will be certitude about their meaning, as is so with those coming from the Spirit of truth. But he will not be able to counterfeit the effects that were mentioned or leave this peace or light in the soul; on the contrary he leaves restlessness and disturbance. But he can do little harm or none if the soul is humble and does what I have mentioned, that is, doesn't make a move to do a thing of what he hears.
17. If the locutions contain words of favor and consolation from the Lord, let the soul look attentively to see if it thinks that because of them it is better than others. The more it hears words of favor the more humble it should be left; if it isn't,",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,12,0,8,11,5,0,0,19,8,12,19,5,2,5,0,0,0,0,0
"769",1577,161,"let it believe that the spirit is not from God. One thing very certain is that when the spirit is from God the soul esteems itself less, the greater the favor granted, and it has more awareness of its sins and is more forgetful of its own gain, and its will and memory are employed more in seeking only the honor of God, nor does it think about its own profit, and it walks with greater fear lest its will deviate in anything, and with greater certitude that it never deserved any of those favors but deserved hell. Since all the favors and things it experienced in prayer produce these effects, the soul does not walk fearfully but with confidence in the mercy of the Lord, who is faithful and will not let the devil deceive it; although walking with fear is always good.
18. It could be that those whom the Lord does not lead along this path think such souls could refuse to listen to these words spoken to them -- and if the words are interior distract themselves in such a way that they not be admitted -- and as a result go about free of these dangers.
To this, I reply that it is impossible. I'm not speaking of imaginary locutions, for by not being so desirous of a thing or wanting to pay attention to their imaginings souls have a remedy. In locutions from the Lord, they have none. For the very spirit that speaks puts a stop to all other thoughts and makes the soul attend to what is said. It does this in such a way that I think, and I believe truly, that somehow it would be more possible for a person with very good hearing not to hear someone else speaking in a loud voice. In this latter instance the person would be able to turn his attention away and center his mind and intellect on something else. But in the locution we are speaking about this cannot be done; there are no ears to stop, nor is there the power to think of anything but what is said to the soul. For He who was able to stop the sun (through Joshua's prayer, I believe) can make the faculties and the whole interior stop in such a way that the soul sees clearly that another greater Lord than itself governs that castle. And this brings it deep devotion and humility. So there's no remedy for this kind of locution. May",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,3,24,0,8,14,4,2,0,16,7,8,10,8,1,13,0,1,0,0,0
"770",1577,162,"the divine Majesty provide a remedy that will enable us to place our eyes only on pleasing Him and to be forgetful of ourselves, as I said, amen.
Please God that I may have succeeded in explaining what I set out to; may it be helpful for whoever has had such experience.

CHAPTER 4
 
Treats of when God suspends the soul in prayer with rapture or ecstasy or transport, which are all the same in my opinion, and how great courage is necessary to receive sublime favors from His Majesty.
 
1. With these trials and the other things that were mentioned, what kind of calm can the poor little butterfly have? All these sufferings are meant to increase one's desire to enjoy the Spouse. And His Majesty, as one who knows our weakness, is enabling the soul through these afflictions and many others to have the courage to be joined with so great a Lord and to take Him as its Spouse.
2. You will laugh at my saying this and will think it's foolishness; it will seem to any one of you that such courage is unnecessary and that there's no woman so miserable who wouldn't have the courage to be married to the king. I believe this is true with respect to kings here on earth; but with respect to the King of heaven, I tell you there is need for more courage than you think. Our nature is very timid and lowly when it comes to something so great, and I am certain that if God were not to give the courage, no matter how much you might see that the favor is good for us, it would be impossible for you to receive that favor. And thus you will see what His Majesty does to conclude this betrothal, which I understand comes about when He gives the soul raptures that draw it out of its senses. For if it were to see itself so near this great Majesty while in its senses, it would perhaps die. Let it be understood that I mean true raptures and not the weaknesses women experience here below, for everything seems to us to be a rapture or an ecstasy. And, as I believe I have said, some have constitutions so weak that the prayer of quiet is enough to make them die.
I want to put down here some kinds of rapture that I've come to understand because I've discussed them with so many spiritual persons. But I don't know whether I",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,13,2,7,30,2,0,2,17,6,9,16,7,4,4,0,1,3,0,0
"771",1577,163,"shall succeed as I did when I wrote elsewhere about them and other things that occur in this dwelling place. On account of certain reasons it seems worthwhile to speak of these kinds of rapture again, and, if for no other reason, so that everything related to these dwelling places will be put down here together.
3. One kind of rapture is that in which the soul even though not in prayer is touched by some word it remembers or hears about God. It seems that His Majesty from the interior of the soul makes the spark we mentioned increase, for He is moved with compassion in seeing the soul suffer so long a time from its desire. All burnt up, the soul is renewed like the phoenix, and one can devoutly believe that its faults are pardoned. Now that it is so pure, the Lord joins it with Himself, without anyone understanding what is happening except these two; nor does the soul itself understand in a way that can afterward be explained. Yet, it does have interior understanding, for this experience is not like that of fainting or convulsion; in these latter nothing is understood inwardly or outwardly.
4. What I know in this case is that the soul was never so awake to the things of God nor did it have such deep enlightenment and knowledge of His Majesty. This will seem impossible for if the faculties are so absorbed that we can say they are dead, and likewise the senses, how can a soul know that it understands this secret? I don't know, nor perhaps does any creature but only the Creator. And this goes for many other things that take place in this state -- I mean in these two dwelling places, for there is no closed door between the one and the other. Because there are things in the last that are not revealed to those who have not yet reached it, I thought I should divide them.
5. When the soul is in this suspension, the Lord likes to show it some secrets, things about heaven, and imaginative visions. It is able to tell of them afterward, for these remain so impressed on the memory that they are never forgotten. But when the visions are intellectual, the soul doesn't know how to speak of them. For there must be some visions during these moments that are so sublime that it's not fitting for those who live on this earth to have the further understanding necessary",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,15,1,5,10,3,0,1,29,6,6,14,8,1,4,1,0,1,0,0
"772",1577,164,"to explain them. However, when the soul is again in possession of its senses, it can say many things about these intellectual visions.
It could be that some of you do not know what a vision is, especially an intellectual one. I shall explain at the proper time, for one who has the authority ordered me to do so. And although the explanation may not seem pertinent, it will perhaps benefit some souls.
6. Well now you will ask me: if afterward there is to be no remembrance of these sublime favors granted by the Lord to the soul in this state, what benefit do they have? Oh, daughters, they are so great one cannot exaggerate! For even though they are unexplainable, they are well inscribed in the very interior part of the soul and are never forgotten.
But, you will insist, if there is no image and the faculties do not understand, how can the visions be remembered? I don't understand this either; but I do understand that some truths about the grandeur of God remain so fixed in this soul, that even if faith were not to tell it who God is and of its obligation to believe that He is God, from that very moment it would adore Him as God, as did Jacob when he saw the ladder. By means of the ladder Jacob must have understood other secrets that he didn't know how to explain, for by seeing just a ladder on which angels descended and ascended he would not have understood such great mysteries if there had not been deeper interior enlightenment. I don't know if I'm guessing right in what I say, for although I have heard this story about Jacob, I don't know if I'm remembering it correctly.
7. Nor did Moses know how to describe all that he saw in the bush, but only what God wished him to describe. But if God had not shown secrets to his soul along with a certitude that made him recognize and believe that they were from God, Moses could not have entered into so many severe trials. But he must have understood such deep things among the thorns of that bush that the vision gave him the courage to do what he did for the people of Israel. So, Sisters, we don't have to look for reasons to understand the hidden things of God. Since we believe He is powerful, clearly we must believe that a worm with as limited a power as ours will",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,17,0,1,14,0,0,0,31,6,15,15,8,5,3,0,0,0,0,0
"773",1577,165,"not understand His grandeurs. Let us praise Him, for He is pleased that we come to know some of them.
8. I have been wanting to find some comparison by which to explain what I'm speaking about, and I don't think there is any that fits. But let's use this one: you enter into the room of a king or great lord, or I believe they call it the treasure chamber, where there are countless kinds of glass and earthen vessels and other things so arranged that almost all these objects are seen upon entering. Once I was brought to a room like this in the house of the Duchess of Alba where, while I was on a journey, obedience ordered me to stay because of this lady's insistence with my superiors. I was amazed on entering and wondered what benefit could be gained from the conglomeration of things, and I saw that one could praise the Lord at seeing so many different kinds of objects, and now I laugh to myself upon realizing how the experience has helped me here in my explanation. Although I was in that room for a while, there was so much there to see that I soon forgot it all; none of those pieces has remained in my memory any more than if I had never seen them, nor would I know how to explain the workmanship of any of them. I can only say in general that I remember seeing everything. Likewise with this favor, the soul, while it is made one with God, is placed in this room of the empyreal heaven that we must have interiorly. For clearly, the soul has some of these dwelling places since God abides within it. And although the Lord must not want the soul to see these secrets every time it is in this ecstasy, for it can be so absorbed in enjoying Him that a sublime good like that is sufficient for it, sometimes He is pleased that the absorption decrease and the soul see at once what is in that room. After it returns to itself, the soul is left with that representation of the grandeurs it saw; but it cannot describe any of them, nor do its natural powers attain to any more than what God wished that it see supernaturally.
9. You, therefore, might object that I admit that the soul sees and that the vision is an imaginative one. But I'm not saying that, for I'm not dealing with an",1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,0,15,0,1,19,1,0,0,16,8,9,15,8,11,3,0,0,0,0,0
"774",1577,166,"imaginative vision but with an intellectual one. Since I have no learning, I don't know how in my dullness to explain anything. If what I have said up to now about this prayer is worthwhile, I know clearly that I'm not the one who has said it.
I hold that if at times in its raptures the soul doesn't understand these secrets, its raptures are not given by God but caused by some natural weakness. It can happen to persons with a weak constitution, as is so with women, that any spiritual force will overcome the natural powers, and the soul will be absorbed as I believe I mentioned in reference to the prayer of quiet. These experiences have nothing to do with rapture. In a rapture, believe me, God carries off for Himself the entire soul, and, as to someone who is His own and His spouse, He begins showing it some little part of the kingdom that it has gained by being espoused to Him. However small that part of His kingdom may be, everything that there is in this great God is magnificent. And He doesn't want any hindrance from anyone, neither from the faculties nor from the senses, but he immediately commands the doors of all these dwelling places to be closed; and only that door to His dwelling place remains open so that we can enter. Blessed be so much mercy; they will be rightly cursed who have not wanted to benefit by it and who have lost this Lord.
10. Oh, my Sisters, what nothingness it is, that which we leave! Nor is what we do anything, nor all that we could do for a God who thus wishes to communicate Himself to a worm! And if we hope to enjoy this blessing even in this present life, what are we doing? What is causing us to delay? What is enough to make us, even momentarily, stop looking for this Lord as the bride looked for Him in the streets and in the squares? Oh, what a mockery everything in the world is if it doesn't lead us and help us toward this blessing even if its delights and riches and joys, as much of them as imaginable, were to last forever! It is all loathsome dung compared to these treasures that will be enjoyed without end. Nor are these anything in comparison with having as our own the Lord of all the treasures of heaven and earth.
11. Oh, human blindness! How long, how",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,2,1,18,0,7,17,2,1,2,12,10,10,16,9,4,3,0,0,4,0,0
"775",1577,167,"long before this dust will be removed from our eyes! Even though among ourselves the dust doesn't seem to be capable of blinding us completely, I see some specks, some tiny pebbles that if we allow them to increase will be enough to do us great harm. On the contrary, for the love of God, Sisters, let us benefit by these faults so as to know our misery, and they will give us clearer vision as did the mud to the blind man cured by our Spouse. Thus, seeing ourselves so imperfect, let us increase our supplications that His Majesty may draw good out of our miseries so that we might be pleasing to Him.
12. I have digressed a great deal without realizing it. Pardon me, Sisters, and believe me that having reached these grandeurs of God (I mean, reached the place where I must speak of them), I cannot help but feel very sorry to see what we lose through our own fault. Even though it is true that these are blessings the Lord gives to whomever He wills, His Majesty would give them all to us if we loved Him as He loves us. He doesn't desire anything else than to have those to whom to give. His riches do not lessen when He gives them away.
13. Well now, to get back to what I was saying, the Spouse commands that the doors of the dwelling places be closed and even those of the castle and the outer wall. For in desiring to carry off this soul, He takes away the breath so that, even though the other senses sometimes last a little longer, a person cannot speak at all; although at other times everything is taken away at once, and the hands and the body grow cold so that the person doesn't seem to have any life; nor sometimes is it known whether he is breathing. This situation lasts but a short while, I mean in its intensity; for when this extreme suspension lets up a little, it seems that the body returns to itself somewhat and is nourished so as to die again and give more life to the soul. Nevertheless so extreme an ecstasy doesn't last long.
14. But it will happen that even though the extreme ecstasy ends, the will remains so absorbed and the intellect so withdrawn, for a day and even days, that the latter seems incapable of understanding anything that doesn't lead to awakening the will to love; and the",3,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,6,1,8,17,3,0,3,13,3,6,16,6,6,3,3,6,4,4,0
"776",1577,168,"will is wide awake to this love and asleep to becoming attached to any creature.
15. Oh, when the soul returns completely to itself, what bewilderment and how intense its desires to be occupied in God in every kind of way He might want! If the effects that were mentioned were produced by the former kinds of prayer what will be the effects of a favor as sublime as this? The soul would desire to have a thousand lives so as to employ them all for God and that everything here on earth would be a tongue to help it praise Him. The desires to do penance are most strong, but not much help comes from performing it, because the strength of love makes the soul feel that all that is done amounts to little and see clearly that the martyrs did not accomplish much in suffering the torments they did because with this help from our Lord, such suffering is easy. Hence these souls complain to His Majesty when no opportunity for suffering presents itself.
16. When this favor is granted them in secret, their esteem for it is great; when it is given in the presence of other persons, their embarrassment and shame are so strong that the pain and worry over what those who saw it will think somehow take the soul away from what was being enjoyed. For these persons know the malice of the world, and they understand that the world will not perhaps regard the experience for what it is, but that what the Lord should be praised for will perhaps be the occasion for rash judgments. In some ways it seems to me that this pain and embarrassment amount to a lack of humility, for if this person desires to be reviled, what difference does it make what others think? But the soul cannot control such feelings. One who was in this affliction heard from the Lord: ""Don't be afflicted, either they will praise Me or criticize you; and in either case you gain."" I learned afterward that this person was very much consoled and encouraged by these words, and I put them down here in case one of you might find herself in this affliction. It seems that our Lord wishes all to understand that that soul is now His, that no one should touch it. Well and good if its body, or honor, or possessions are touched for this soul draws honor for His Majesty out of everything.

"777",1577,169,"touch the soul -- absolutely not; for if the soul does not withdraw from its Spouse through a very culpable boldness, He will protect it from the whole world and even from all hell.
17. I don't know if anything has been explained about the nature of rapture, for to explain it is completely impossible, as I have said. But I don't believe anything has been lost by trying. For there are effects that are very different in feigned raptures. I do not say ""feigned"" because the one who has the experience wants to deceive but because that person is deceived. And since the signs and effects of the feigned raptures are not in conformity with such a great blessing, the true rapture is looked upon unfavorably; and afterward the one to whom the Lord grants it, justifiably is not believed. May He be blessed and praised forever, amen, amen. CHAPTER 5
 
Continues on the same subject and deals with a kind of rapture in which God raises up the soul through a flight of the spirit, an experience different from that just explained. Tells why courage is necessary. Explains something about this delightful favor the Lord grants. The chapter is a very beneficial one.
 
1. There is another kind of rapture -- I call it flight of the spirit -- which, though substantially the same as other raptures, is interiorly experienced very differently. For sometimes suddenly a movement of the soul is felt so swift that it seems the spirit is carried off, and at a fearful speed especially in the beginning. This is why I have told you that strong courage is necessary for the one to whom God grants these favors, and even faith and confidence and a full surrender to our Lord so that He may do what He wants with the soul. Do you think it is a small disturbance for a person to be very much in his senses and see his soul carried off (and in the case of some, we have read, even the body with the soul) without knowing where that soul is going, what or who does this, or how? At the beginning of this swift movement there is not so much certitude that the rapture is from God.
2. Well, now, is there some means by which one can resist it? None at all; rather, to resist makes matters worse, for I know this was so with a certain person. It seems God wishes that the soul that has",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,26,0,5,17,2,1,1,18,10,7,14,10,2,2,2,1,0,0,0
"778",1577,170,"so often so earnestly, and with such complete willingness offered everything to Him should understand that in itself it no longer has any part to play; and it is carried off with a noticeably more impetuous movement. It is determined now to do no more than what the straw does when drawn by the amber -- if you have noticed -- and abandon itself into the hands of the One who is all powerful, for it sees that the safest thing to do is to make a virtue of necessity. And that I mentioned a straw is certainly appropriate, for as easily as a huge giant snatches up a straw, this great and powerful Giant of ours carries away the spirit.
3. It seems the trough of water we mentioned (I believe it was in the fourth dwelling place, for I don't recall exactly) filled so easily and gently, I mean without any movement. Here this great God, who holds back the springs of water and doesn't allow the sea to go beyond its boundaries, lets loose the springs from which the water in this trough flows. With a powerful impulse, a huge wave rises up so forcefully that it lifts high this little bark that is our soul. A bark cannot prevent the furious waves from leaving it where they will; nor does the pilot have the power, nor do those who take part in controlling the little ship. So much less can the interior part of the soul stay where it will, or make its senses or faculties do other than what they are commanded; here the soul doesn't care what happens in the exterior senses.
4. It is certain, Sisters, that just from writing about it I am amazed at how the immense power of this great King and Emperor is shown here. What will be the amazement of the one who experiences it! I hold that if His Majesty were to reveal this power to those who go astray in the world as He does to these souls, the former would not dare offend Him; this out of fear if not out of love. Oh, how obliged, then, will those persons be who have been informed through so sublime a path to strive with all their might not to displease this Lord! For love of Him, Sisters, I beg you, those of you to whom His Majesty has granted these favors, or others like them, that you don't grow careless and do nothing but receive. Reflect",2,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,7,0,6,19,2,2,1,13,7,5,11,7,1,0,2,1,0,2,3
"779",1577,171,"that the one who owes a lot must pay a lot.
5. In this respect, too, great courage is necessary, for this favor is something frightening. If our Lord were not to give such courage, the soul would always go about deeply distressed. For it reflects on what His Majesty does for it and turns back to look at itself, at how little it serves in comparison with its obligation, and at how the tiny bit it does is full of faults, failures, and weaknesses. So as not to recall how imperfectly it performs some work -- if it does -- it prefers striving to forget its works, keeping in mind its sins, and placing itself before the mercy of God. Since it doesn't have anything with which to pay, it begs for the pity and mercy God has always had toward sinners.
6. Perhaps He will respond as He did to a person who before a crucifix was reflecting with deep affliction that she had never had anything to give to God, or anything to give up for Him. The Crucified, Himself, in consoling her told her He had given her all the sufferings and trials He had undergone in His Passion so that she could have them as her own to offer His Father. The comfort and enrichment was such that, according to what I have heard from her, she cannot forget the experience. Rather, every time she sees how miserable she is, she gets encouragement and consolation from remembering those words.
I could mention here some other experiences like this, for since I have dealt with so many holy and prayerful persons, I know about many such experiences; but I want to limit myself lest you think I am speaking of myself. What I said seems to me very beneficial to help you understand how pleased our Lord is that we know ourselves and strive to reflect again and again on our poverty and misery and on how we possess nothing that we have not received. So, my Sisters, courage is necessary for this knowledge and for the many other graces given to the soul the Lord has brought to this stage. And when there is humility, courage, in my opinion, is even more necessary for this knowledge of one's own misery. May the Lord give us this humility because of who He is.
7. Well, now, to return to this quick rapture of the spirit. It is such that the spirit truly seems to go forth from the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,4,19,0,10,16,5,0,5,14,9,9,16,10,2,3,0,0,1,1,0
"780",1577,172,"body. On the other hand, it is clear that this person is not dead; at least, he cannot say whether for some moments he was in the body or not. It seems to him that he was entirely in another region different from this in which we live, where there is shown another light so different from earth's light that if he were to spend his whole life trying to imagine that light, along with the other things, he would be unable to do so. It happens that within an instant so many things together are taught him that if he were to work for many years with his imagination and mind in order to systematize them he wouldn't be able to do so, not with even one thousandth part of one of them. This is not an intellectual but an imaginative vision, for the eyes of the soul see much better than do we with bodily eyes here on earth, and without words understanding of some things is given; I mean that if a person sees some saints, he knows them as well as if he had often spoken with them.
8. At other times, along with the things seen through the eyes of the soul by an intellectual vision, other things are represented, especially a multitude of angels with their Lord. And without seeing anything with the eyes of the body or the soul, through an admirable knowledge I will not be able to explain, there is represented what I'm saying and many other things not meant to be spoken of. Anyone who experiences them, and has more ability then I, will perhaps know how to explain them; although doing so seems to me very difficult indeed. Whether all this takes place in the body or not, I wouldn't know; at least I wouldn't swear that the soul is in the body or that the body is without the soul.
9. I have often thought that just as the sun while in the sky has such strong rays that, even though it doesn't move from there, the rays promptly reach the earth, so the soul and the spirit, which are one, could be like the sun and its rays. Thus, while the soul remains in its place, the superior part rises above it. In a word, I don't know what I'm saying. What is true, is that with the speed of a ball shot from an arquebus, when fire is applied, an interior flight is experienced -- I",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,11,1,1,9,0,0,0,16,2,9,18,5,8,5,2,12,1,0,0
"781",1577,173,"don't know what else to call it -- which, though noiseless, is so clearly a movement that it cannot be the work of the imagination. And while the spirit is far outside itself, from all it can understand, great things are shown to it. When it again senses that it is within itself, the benefits it feels are remarkable, and it has so little esteem for all earthly things in comparison to the things it has seen that the former seem like dung. From then on its life on earth is very painful, and it doesn't see anything good in those things that used to seem good to it. The experience causes it to care little about them. It seems the Lord, like those Israelites who brought back signs from the promised land, has desired to show it something about its future land so that it may suffer the trials of this laborious path, knowing where it must go to get its final rest. Even though something that passes so quickly will not seem to you very beneficial, the blessings left in the soul are so great that only the person who has this experience will be able to understand its value.
10. Wherefore, the experience, obviously, is not from the devil; it would be impossible for the imagination or the devil to represent things that leave so much virtue, peace, calm, and improvement in the soul. Three things, especially, are left in it to a very sublime degree: knowledge of the grandeur of God, because the more we see in this grandeur the greater is our understanding; self-knowledge and humility upon seeing that something so low in comparison with the Creator of so many grandeurs dared to offend Him (and neither does the soul dare look up at Him); the third, little esteem of earthly things save for those that can be used for the service of so great a God.
11. These are the jewels the Spouse begins to give the betrothed, and their value is such that the soul will not want to lose them. For these meetings remain so engraved in the memory that I believe it's impossible to forget them until one enjoys them forever, unless they are forgotten through one's own most serious fault. But the Spouse who gives them has the power to give the grace not to lose them.
12. Well to get back to the courage that is necessary, does it seem to you that this is so trivial a thing? For",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,1,0,2,11,0,11,26,0,1,4,17,4,6,12,7,5,0,1,0,2,0,0
"782",1577,174,"it truly seems that because the soul loses its senses, and doesn't understand why, that it is separated from the body. It's necessary that He who gives everything else give the courage also. You will say that this fear is well paid. So do I. May it please His Majesty to give us the courage so that we may merit to serve Him, amen.

CHAPTER 6
 
Tells about an effect of the prayer discussed in the previous chapter. How to understand whether this effect is true rather than deceptive. Discusses another favor the Lord grants so that the soul might be occupied in praising Him.
 
1. As a result of these wonderful favors the soul is left so full of longings to enjoy completely the One who grants them that it lives in a great though delightful torment. With the strongest yearnings to die, and thus usually with tears, it begs God to take it from this exile. Everything it sees wearies it. When it is alone it finds some relief, but soon this torment returns; yet when the soul does not experience this pain, something is felt to be missing. In sum, this little butterfly is unable to find a lasting place of rest; rather, since the soul goes about with such tender love, any occasion that enkindles this fire more makes the soul fly aloft. As a result, in this dwelling place the raptures are very common and there is no means to avoid them even though they may take place in public. Hence, persecutions and criticism. Even though the soul may want to be free from fears, others do not allow this freedom. For there are many persons who cause these fears, especially confessors.
2. And even though, on the one hand, the soul seems to feel very secure in its interior part, especially when it is alone with God, on the other hand, it goes about in deep distress because it fears the devil may in some way beguile it into offending the One whom it loves so much. Little does it suffer over criticism, unless the confessor himself distresses it, as if it could do more. It does nothing but ask prayers from all and beg His Majesty to lead it by another path, for they all tell it to take another; they say that the path it is on is very dangerous. But since the soul has found this path to be so greatly beneficial, it sees that such a path is leading it",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,19,1,22,23,8,4,8,15,17,6,14,8,2,2,5,3,2,2,0
"783",1577,175,"along the way to heaven, according to what it reads, hears, and knows about God's commandments. Even if it wanted to, it could not really desire anything else but to abandon itself into God's hands. And even this powerlessness distresses it, for it thinks it is not obeying its confessor. Obeying and not offending our Lord, it thinks, is the complete remedy against deception. Thus, in its opinion, it would not commit knowingly a venial sin even were others to crush it to pieces. It is intensely afflicted upon seeing that it cannot free itself from unknowingly committing many venial sins.
3. God gives these souls the strongest desire not to displease Him in anything, however small, and the desire to avoid if possible every imperfection. For this reason alone, if for no other, the soul wants to flee people, and it has great envy of those who have lived in deserts. On the other hand, it would want to enter into the midst of the world to try to play a part in getting even one soul to praise God more. A woman in this stage of prayer is distressed by the natural hindrance there is to her entering the world, and she has great envy of those who have the freedom to cry out and spread the news abroad about who this great God of hosts is.
4. Oh, poor little butterfly, bound with so many chains which do not let you fly where you would like! Have pity on it, my God! Ordain that it might somehow fulfill its desires for your honor and glory. Do not be mindful of the little it deserves and of its lowly nature. You have the power, Lord, to make the great sea and the large river Jordan roll back and allow the children of Israel to pass. Yet, do not take pity on this little butterfly! Helped by your strength, it can suffer many trials; it is determined to do so and desires to suffer them. Extend Your powerful arm, Lord, that this soul might not spend its life in things so base. Let Your grandeur appear in a creature so feminine and lowly, whatever the cost to her, so that the world may know that this grandeur is not hers at all and may praise You. This praise is what she desires, and she would give a thousand lives -- if she had that many -- if one soul were to praise You a little more through her; and",2,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,4,23,0,17,20,3,3,9,7,6,19,16,5,1,1,2,3,1,0,0
"784",1577,176,"she would consider such lives very well spent. She understands in all truth that she doesn't deserve to suffer for You a tiny trial, much less die.
5. I don't know what my goal was in saying this, Sisters, nor why I said it, for these words were not planned. Let us realize that such effects are undoubtedly left by these suspensions and ecstasies. The desires are not passing but remain, and when an occasion arises to manifest their presence, one sees that they are not feigned. Why do I say they remain? Sometimes the soul feels, and in the smallest things, that it is a coward and so timid and frightened it doesn't think that it has the courage to do anything. I understand that the Lord leaves it then to its own human nature for its own greater good. It then sees that if it had been able to do something, the power was given by His Majesty. This truth is seen with a clarity that leaves the soul annihilated within itself and with deeper knowledge of God's mercy and grandeur -- attributes the Lord desired to show to something so low. But usually its state is like that we've just mentioned.
6. Note one thing, Sisters, about these great desires to see our Lord: they sometimes afflict so much that you must necessarily avoid fostering them and must distract yourselves; if you can, I mean, for in other instances which I shall mention further on, this cannot be done, as you will see. As for these initial desires, it's sometimes possible to distract oneself from them because there is every reason to be conformed to the will of God and say what St. Martin said. A person can reflect upon St. Martin's words if the desires afflict a great deal. Since it seems these desires are characteristic of very advanced persons, the devil could instigate them so that we might think we are advanced. It is always good to walk with fear. But my opinion is that he would not be able to give the quiet and peace this suffering gives the soul; he would be stirring some passion, as happens when we suffer over worldly things. But a person who has no experience of the authentic and the inauthentic desires will think his desires are something great and will help them along as much as he can and will do serious harm to his health. For this suffering is continual, or at least very habitual.
7. Also",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,10,1,14,14,6,0,5,15,7,17,17,9,5,6,1,0,1,1,0
"785",1577,177,"note that a weak constitution is wont to cause these kinds of suffering, especially in the case of tender persons who will weep over every little thing. A thousand times they will be led to think they weep for God, but they will not be doing so. And it can even happen, when tears flow in abundance (I mean, that for a time every little word the soul hears or thinks concerning God becomes the cause of tears), that some humor has reached the heart thereby contributing more to the tears than does love for God; for seemingly these persons will never finish weeping. Since they have already heard that tears are good, they will not restrain themselves nor would they desire to do anything else; and they help the tears along as much as they can. The devil's aim here is that these persons become so weak they will afterward be unable either to pray or to keep their rule.
8. It seems to me I can see you asking what you should do since I mark danger everywhere and in something as good as tears I think there can be deception; you are wondering if I may be the one who is deceived. And it could be that I am. But believe me, I do not speak without having seen that these false tears can be experienced by some persons; although not by me, for I am not at all tender. Rather, I have a heart so hard that sometimes I am distressed; although when the inner fire is intense, the heart, no matter how hard, distills like an alembic. You will indeed know when this fire is the source of the tears, for they are then more comforting and bring peace not turbulence, and seldom cause harm. The good that lies in the false tears -- when there is any good -- is that the damage is done to the body (I mean when there is humility) and not to the soul. But even if there is no harm done to the body, it won't be wrong to be suspicious about tears.
9. Let's not think that everything is accomplished through much weeping but set our hands to the task of hard work and virtue. These are what we must pay attention to; let the tears come when God sends them and without any effort on our part to induce them. These tears from God will irrigate this dry earth, and they are a great help in",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,1,9,0,28,13,2,2,18,16,9,8,15,7,2,3,7,6,4,1,0
"786",1577,178,"producing fruit. The less attention we pay to them the more there are, for they are the water that falls from heaven. The tears we draw out by tiring ourselves in digging cannot compare with the tears that come from God, for often in digging we shall get worn out and not find even a puddle of water much less a flowing well. Therefore, Sisters, I consider it better for us to place ourselves in the presence of the Lord and look at His mercy and grandeur and at our own lowliness, and let Him give us what He wants, whether water or dryness. He knows best what is suitable for us. With such an attitude we shall go about refreshed, and the devil will not have so much chance to play tricks on us.
10. In the midst of the experiences that are both painful and delightful together, our Lord sometimes gives the soul feelings of jubilation and a strange prayer it doesn't understand. I am writing about this favor here so that if He grants it to you, you may give Him much praise and know what is taking place. It is, in my opinion, a deep union of the faculties; but our Lord nonetheless leaves them free that they might enjoy this joy -- and the same goes for the senses -- without understanding what it is they are enjoying or how they are enjoying. What I'm saying seems like gibberish, but certainly the experience takes place in this way, for the joy is so excessive the soul wouldn't want to enjoy it alone but wants to tell everyone about it so that they might help this soul praise our Lord. All its activity is directed to this praise. Oh, how many festivals and demonstrations the soul would organize, if it could, that all might know its joy! It seems it has found itself and that, like the father of the prodigal son, it would want to prepare a festival and invite all because it sees itself in an undoubtedly safe place, at least for the time being. And I hold that there is reason for its desires. The devil cannot give this experience, because there is so much interior joy in the very intimate part of the soul and so much peace; and all the happiness stirs the soul to the praises of God.
11. To be silent and conceal this great impulse of happiness when experiencing it, is no small pain. St. Francis must have",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,2,22,0,10,31,0,1,4,14,7,12,14,7,2,2,2,0,3,0,4
"787",1577,179,"felt this impulse when the robbers struck him, for he ran through the fields crying out and telling the robbers that he was the herald of the great King; and also other saints must feel it who go to deserts to be able to proclaim as St. Francis these praises of their God. I knew a saint named Friar Peter of Alcántara -- for I believe from the way he lived that he was one -- who did this very thing, and those who at one time listened to him thought he was crazy. Oh, what blessed madness, Sisters! If only God would give it to us all! And what a favor He has granted you by bringing you to this house where, when the Lord gives you this favor and you tell others about it, you will receive help rather than the criticism you would receive in the world. This proclamation is so unusual there that one is not at all surprised at the criticism.
12. Oh, how unfortunate the times and miserable the life in which we now live; happy are they whose good fortune it is to remain apart from the world. Sometimes it is a particular joy for me to see these Sisters gathered together and feeling such great joy at being in the monastery that they praise our Lord as much as possible. It is seen very clearly that their praises rise from the interior of the soul. I would want you to praise Him often, Sisters; for the one who begins, awakens the others. In what better way can you, when together, use your tongues than in the praises of God since we have so many reasons for praising Him?
13. May it please His Majesty to give us this prayer often since it is so safe and beneficial; to acquire it is impossible because it is something very supernatural. And it may last a whole day. The soul goes about like a person who has drunk a great deal but not so much as to be drawn out of his senses; or like a person suffering melancholy who has not lost his reason completely but cannot free himself from what is in his imagination -- nor can anyone else.
These are inelegant comparisons for something so precious, but I can't think up any others. The joy makes a person so forgetful of self and of all things that he doesn't advert to, nor can he speak of anything other than the praises of God",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,20,0,9,27,2,2,5,11,8,8,13,6,2,2,3,1,1,0,1
"788",1577,180,"which proceed from his joy.
Let us all help this soul, my daughters. Why do we want to have more discretion? What can give us greater happiness? And may all creatures help us forever and ever, amen, amen, amen!

CHAPTER 7
 
Discusses the kind of suffering those souls to whom God grants the favors mentioned feel concerning their sins. Tells what a great mistake it is, however spiritual one may be, not to practice keeping the humanity of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ present in one's mind; also His most sacred Passion and life, His glorious Mother, and the saints. The chapter is very helpful.
 
1. You will think, Sisters, that these souls to whom the Lord communicates Himself in this unusual way will already be so sure of enjoying Him forever that they will have nothing to fear nor sins to weep over. Those especially who have not attained these favors from God will think this, for if they had enjoyed them, they would know what I'm going to say. But to think the above would be a great mistake because suffering over one's sins increases the more one receives from our God. And, for my part, I hold that until we are there where nothing can cause pain this suffering will not be taken away.
2. True, sometimes there is greater affliction than at other times; and the affliction is also of a different kind, for the soul doesn't think about the suffering it will undergo on account of its sins but of how ungrateful it has been to One to whom it owes so much and who deserves so much to be served. For in these grandeurs God communicates to it, it understands much more about Him. It is astonished at how bold it was; it weeps over its lack of respect; it thinks its foolishness was so excessive that it never finishes grieving over that foolishness when it recalls that for such base things it abandoned so great a Majesty. Much more does it recall this foolishness than it does the favors it receives, though these favors are as remarkable as the ones mentioned or as those still to be spoken of. These favors are like the waves of a large river in that they come and go; but the memory these souls have of their sins clings like thick mire. It always seems that these sins are alive in the memory, and this is a heavy cross.
3. I know a person who, apart from wanting",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,25,2,22,22,1,0,8,14,5,8,7,9,0,2,3,0,3,1,0
"789",1577,181,"to die in order to see God, wanted to die so as not to feel the continual pain of how ungrateful she had been to One to whom she ever owed so much and would owe. Thus it didn't seem to her that anyone's wickedness could equal her own, for she understood that there could be no one else from whom God would have had so much to put up with and to whom He had granted so many favors. As for the fear of hell, such persons don't have any. That they might lose God, at times -- though seldom -- distresses them very much. All their fear is that God might allow them out of His hand to offend Him, and they find themselves in as miserable a state as they were once before. In regard to their own suffering or glory, they don't care. If they don't want to stay long in purgatory, the reason comes from the fact of their not wanting to be away from God -- as are those who are in purgatory -- rather than from the sufferings undergone there.
4. I wouldn't consider it safe for a soul, however favored by God, to forget that at one time it saw itself in a miserable state. Although recalling this misery is a painful thing, doing so is helpful for many. Perhaps it is because I have been so wretched that I have this opinion and am always mindful of my misery. Those who have been good will not have to feel this pain, although there will always be failures as long as we live in this mortal body. No relief is afforded this suffering by the thought that our Lord has already pardoned and forgotten the sins. Rather, it adds to the suffering to see so much goodness and realize that favors are granted to one who deserves nothing but hell. I think such a realization was a great martyrdom for St. Peter and the Magdalene. Since their love for God had grown so deep and they had received so many favors and come to know the grandeur and majesty of God, the remembrance of their misery would have been difficult to suffer, and they would have suffered it with tender sentiments.
5. It will also seem to you that anyone who enjoys such lofty things will no longer meditate on the mysteries of the most sacred humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ. Such a person would now be engaged entirely in loving.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,20,3,25,18,8,4,12,15,6,14,13,6,3,0,3,2,4,1,0
"790",1577,182,"This is a matter I wrote about at length elsewhere. They have contradicted me about it and said that I don't understand, because these are paths along which our Lord leads, and that when souls have already passed beyond the beginning stages it is better for them to deal with things concerning the divinity and flee from corporeal things. Nonetheless, they will not make me admit that such a road is a good one. Now it could be that I'm mistaken and that we are all saying the same thing. But I myself see that the devil tried to deceive me in this matter, and thus I have so learned my lesson from experience that I think, although I've spoken on this topic at other times, I will speak of it again here that you will proceed very carefully in this matter. And take notice that I dare say you should not believe anyone who tells you something else. I'll try to explain myself better than I did elsewhere. If anyone perhaps has written what a certain person told me, this would be good if the matter is explained at length, but to speak of it so summarily could do much harm to those of us who are not well informed.
6. It will also seem to some souls that they cannot think about the Passion, or still less about the Blessed Virgin and the lives of the saints; the remembrance of both of these latter is so very helpful and encouraging. I cannot imagine what such souls are thinking of. To be always withdrawn from corporeal things and enkindled in love is the trait of angelic spirits not of those who live in mortal bodies. It's necessary that we speak to, think about, and become the companions of those who having had a mortal body accomplished such great feats for God. How much more is it necessary not to withdraw through one's own efforts from all our good and help which is the most sacred humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ. I cannot believe that these souls do so, but they just don't understand; and they will do harm to themselves and to others. At least I assure them that they will not enter these last two dwelling places. For if they lose the guide, who is the good Jesus, they will not hit upon the right road. It will be quite an accomplishment if they remain safely in the other dwelling places. The Lord Himself says that",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,18,2,9,18,2,2,1,19,5,9,13,7,1,8,0,2,0,3,0
"791",1577,183,"He is the way; the Lord says also that He is the light and that no one can go to the Father but through Him, and ""anyone who sees me sees my Father."" They will say that another meaning is given to these words. I don't know about those other meanings; I have got along very well with this one that my soul always feels to be true.
7. There are some souls -- and there are many who have spoken about it to me -- who brought by our Lord to perfect contemplation would like to be in that prayer always; but that is impossible. Yet this favor of the Lord remains with them in such a way that afterward they cannot engage as before in discursive thought about the mysteries of the Passion and life of Christ. I don't know the reason, but this inability is very common, for the intellect becomes less capable of meditation. I believe the reason must be that since in meditation the whole effort consists in seeking God and that once God is found the soul becomes used to seeking Him again through the work of the will, the soul doesn't want to tire itself by working with the intellect. Likewise, it seems to me that since this generous faculty, which is the will, is already enkindled, it wants to avoid, if it can, using the other faculty; and it doesn't go wrong. But to avoid this will be impossible, especially before the soul reaches these last two dwelling places; and the soul will lose time, for the will often needs the help of the intellect so as to be enkindled.
8. And note this point, Sisters; it is important, and so I want to explain it further: The soul desires to be completely occupied in love and does not want to be taken up with anything else, but to be so occupied is impossible for it even though it may want to; for although the will is not dead, the fire that usually makes it burn is dying out, and someone must necessarily blow on the fire so that heat will be given off. Would it be good for a soul with this dryness to wait for fire to come down from heaven to burn this sacrifice that it is making of itself to God, as did our Father Elijah? No, certainly not, nor is it right to expect miracles. The Lord works them for this soul when He pleases, as was",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,5,2,0,0,22,2,5,17,3,0,1,15,8,16,10,9,2,3,5,0,2,2,0
"792",1577,184,"said and will be said further on. But His Majesty wants us to consider ourselves undeserving of them because of our wretchedness, and desires that we help ourselves in every way possible. I hold for myself that until we die such an attitude is necessary however sublime the prayer may be.
9. It is true that anyone whom the Lord places in the seventh dwelling place rarely, or hardly ever, needs to make this effort. (I will give the reason for this fact when speaking of that dwelling place, if I remember.) But such a person walks continually in an admirable way with Christ, our Lord, in whom the divine and the human are joined and who is always that person's companion. As for the above, when the fire in the will that was mentioned is not enkindled and God's presence is not felt, it is necessary that we seek this presence. This is what His Majesty wants us to do, as the bride did in the Song of Songs, and he wants us to ask creatures who it is who made them -- as St. Augustine says, I believe, in his Meditations or Confessions -- and not be like dunces wasting time waiting for what was given us once before. At the beginning of the life of prayer it may be that the Lord will not give this fire in a year, or even in many years. His Majesty knows why; we must not desire to know nor is there any reason why we should. Since we know the path by which we must please God, which is that of the commandments and counsels, we should follow it very diligently, and think of His life and death and of the many things we owe Him; let the rest come when the Lord desires.
10. At this point, someone may respond that he cannot dwell on these things, and, because of what was said, perhaps he will in a certain way be right. You already know that discursive thinking with the intellect is one thing and representing truths to the intellect by means of the memory is another. You may say, perhaps, that you do not understand me, and indeed it could be that I don't know how to explain the matter; but I shall do the best I can. By meditation I mean much discursive reflection with the intellect in the following way: we begin to think about the favor God granted us in giving us His only Son,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,14,2,3,13,3,0,0,21,10,13,15,12,0,8,3,0,2,0,0
"793",1577,185,"and we do not stop there, but go on to the mysteries of His whole glorious life; or we begin to think about the prayer in the garden, but the intellect doesn't stop until He is on the cross; or we take a phase of the Passion like, let us say, the arrest, and we proceed with this mystery considering in detail the things there are to think of and feel about the betrayal of Judas, the flight of the apostles, and all the rest; this kind of reflection is an admirable and very meritorious prayer.
11. This prayer is the kind that those whom God has brought to supernatural things and to perfect contemplation are right in saying they cannot practice. As I have said, I don't know the reason, but usually they cannot practice discursive reflection. But I say that a person will not be right if he says he does not dwell on these mysteries or often have them in mind, especially when the Catholic Church celebrates them. Nor is it possible for the soul to forget that it has received so much from God, so many precious signs of love, for these are living sparks that will enkindle it more in its love for our Lord. But I say this person doesn't understand himself, because the soul understands these mysteries in a more perfect manner. The intellect represents them in such a way, and they are so stamped on the memory, that the mere sight of the Lord fallen to the ground in the garden with that frightful sweat is enough to last the intellect not only an hour but many days, while it looks with a simple gaze at who He is and how ungrateful we have been for so much suffering. Soon the will responds even though it may not do so with tender feelings, with the desire to serve somehow for such a great favor and to suffer something for One who suffered so much, and with other similar desires relating to what the memory and intellect are dwelling upon. I believe that for this reason a person cannot go on to further discursive reflection on the Passion, and this inability makes him think that he cannot think about it.
12. If he doesn't dwell on these mysteries in the way that was mentioned, it is good that he strive to do so, for I know that doing so will not impede the most sublime prayer. I don't think it's good to fail",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,3,2,0,13,0,9,20,4,0,4,22,5,4,17,3,3,6,2,1,3,4,0
"794",1577,186,"to dwell often on these mysteries. If as a result the Lord suspends the intellect, well and good; for even though the soul may not so desire He will make it abandon what it was dwelling on. And I am very certain that this procedure is not a hindrance but a very great help toward every good; the hindrance would come from a great deal of work with the discursive reflection I mentioned in the beginning. I hold that one who has advanced further along cannot practice this discursive reflection. It could be that one can, for God leads souls by many paths. But let not those who can travel by the road of discursive thought condemn those who cannot, or judge them incapable of enjoying the sublime blessings that lie enclosed in the mysteries of our good, Jesus Christ. Nor will anyone make me think, however spiritual he may be, that he will advance by trying to turn away from these mysteries.
13. There are some principles and even means that certain souls use, by which it is thought that when a person begins to experience the prayer of quiet and to relish the enjoyment and spiritual delights given by the Lord, the important thing is to remain always in that state of delight. Well, now, let them believe me and not be so absorbed, as I have said elsewhere. Life is long, and there are in it many trials, and we need to look at Christ our model, how He suffered them, and also at His apostles and saints, so as to bear these trials with perfection. Jesus is too good a companion for us to turn away from Him and His most Blessed Mother, and He is very pleased that we grieve over His sufferings even though we sometimes leave aside our own consolation and delight. Moreover, daughters, enjoyment in prayer is not so habitual that there is not time for everything. I would be suspicious of anyone who says this delight is continual; I mean, who can never do what was mentioned. And you should be suspicious too, and strive to free yourselves from this error and avoid such absorption with all your strength. If your efforts aren't enough, tell the prioress so that she might give you some task demanding such care that this danger is removed. For if this absorption continues, it is extremely dangerous at least for the brain and the head.
14. I believe I've explained that it is fitting for souls,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,18,1,10,26,5,2,3,12,6,9,17,9,1,3,0,2,1,0,0
"795",1577,187,"however spiritual, to take care not to flee from corporal things to the extent of thinking that even the most sacred humanity causes harm. Some quote what the Lord said to His disciples that it was fitting that He go. I can't bear this. I would wager that He didn't say it to His most Blessed Mother, because she was firm in the faith; she knew He was God and man, and even though she loved Him more than they did, she did so with such perfection that His presence was a help rather than a hindrance. The apostles must not have been as firm then in the faith as they were afterward and as we have reason to be now. I tell you, daughters, that I consider this a dangerous path and think the devil could make one lose devotion for the most Blessed Sacrament.
15. The mistake it seemed to me I was making wasn't so extreme, rather it consisted of not delighting so much in the thought of our Lord Jesus Christ but in going along in that absorption, waiting for that enjoyment. And I realized clearly that I was proceeding badly. Since it wasn't possible for me to experience the absorption always, the mind wandered here and there. My soul, it seems to me, was like a bird flying about that doesn't know where to light; and it was losing a lot of time and not making progress in virtue or improving in prayer. I didn't understand the reason, nor would I have understood it, in my opinion, because it seemed to me that what I was doing was very correct, until a person with whom I was discussing my prayer, who was a servant of God, warned me. Afterward, I saw clearly how wrong I had been, and I never stop regretting that there had been a time in which I failed to understand that I could not gain much through such a great loss. And even if I could gain, I wouldn't want any good save that acquired through Him from whom all blessings come to us. May He be always praised, amen.

CHAPTER 8
 
Discusses how God communicates Himself to the soul through an intellectual vision; gives some counsels. Tells about the effects such a vision causes if it is genuine. Recommends secrecy concerning these favors.
 
1. For you to see, Sisters, that what I have told you is true and that the further a soul advances the more it is accompanied by",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,22,0,10,21,0,1,5,16,13,14,16,10,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"796",1577,188,"the good Jesus, we will do well to discuss how, when His Majesty desires, we cannot do otherwise then walk always with Him. This is evident in the ways and modes by which His Majesty communicates Himself to us and shows us the love He bears us. He does this through some very wonderful apparitions and visions. That you might not be frightened if He grants you some of these, I want briefly to mention something about these visions -- if the Lord be pleased that I succeed -- so that we might praise Him very much even though He may not grant them to us. We would be praising Him because though He is filled with majesty and power He nonetheless desires to communicate thus with a creature.
2. It will happen while the soul is heedless of any thought about such a favor being granted to it, and though it never had a thought that it deserved this vision, that it will feel Jesus Christ, our Lord, beside it. Yet, it does not see Him, either with the eyes of the body or with those of the soul. This is called an intellectual vision; I don't know why. I saw the person to whom God granted this favor, along with other favors I shall mention further on, quite worried in the beginning because since she didn't see anything she couldn't understand the nature of this vision. However, she knew so certainly that it was Jesus Christ, our Lord, who showed Himself to her in that way that she couldn't doubt; I mean she couldn't doubt the vision was there. As to whether it was from God or not, even though she carried with her great effects to show that it was, she nonetheless was afraid. She had never heard of an intellectual vision, nor had she thought there was such a kind. But she understood very clearly that it was this same Lord who often spoke to her in the way mentioned. For until He granted her this favor I am referring to, she never knew who was speaking to her, although she understood the words.
3. I know that since she was afraid about this vision (for it isn't like the imaginative one that passes quickly, but lasts many days and sometimes even more than a year), she went very worried to her confessor. He asked her how since she didn't see anything she knew that it was our Lord; what kind of face He had. She",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,17,0,7,17,7,0,0,17,10,9,18,7,5,3,1,3,0,1,0
"797",1577,189,"told him she didn't know, that she didn't see any face, and that she couldn't say any more than what she had said, that what she did know was that He was the one who spoke to her and that the vision had not been fancied. And although some persons put many fears in her, she was still frequently unable to doubt, especially when the Lord said to her: ""Do not be afraid, it is I."" These words had so much power that from then on she could not doubt the vision, and she was left very much strengthened and happy over such good company. She saw clearly that the vision was a great help toward walking with a habitual remembrance of God and a deep concern about avoiding anything displeasing to Him, for it seemed to her that He was always looking at her. And each time she wanted to speak with His Majesty in prayer, and even outside of it, she felt He was so near that He couldn't fail to hear her. But she didn't hear words spoken whenever she wanted; only unexpectedly when they were necessary. She felt He was walking at her right side, but she didn't experience this with those senses by which we can know that a person is beside us. This vision comes in another unexplainable, more delicate way. But it is so certain and leaves much certitude; even much more than the other visions do because in the visions that come through the senses one can be deceived, but not in the intellectual vision. For this latter brings great interior benefits and effects that couldn't be present if the experience were caused by melancholy; nor would the devil produce so much good; nor would the soul go about with such peace and continual desires to please God, and with so much contempt for everything that does not bring it to Him. Afterward she understood clearly that the vision was not caused by the devil, which became more and more clear as time went on.
4. Nonetheless, I know that at times she went about very much frightened; at other times, with the most intense confusion, for she didn't know why so much good had come to her. We were so united, she and I, that nothing took place in her soul of which I was ignorant; so I can be a good witness. And believe me, all I have said of this matter is the truth.
It is a favor from",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,8,0,13,16,7,1,2,15,6,10,10,9,3,9,2,1,0,0,0
"798",1577,190,"the Lord that she bears in herself the most intense confusion and humility. If the vision were from the devil, the effects would be contrary. And since the vision is something definitely understood to be a gift from God and human effort would not be sufficient to produce this experience, the one who receives it can in no way think it is his own good but a good given through the hand of God. And even though, in my opinion, some of those favors that were mentioned are greater, this favor bears with it a particular knowledge of God. This continual companionship gives rise to a most tender love for His Majesty, to some desires even greater than those mentioned to surrender oneself totally to His service, and to a great purity of conscience because the presence at its side makes the soul pay attention to everything. For even though we already know that God is present in all we do, our nature is such that we neglect to think of this. Here the truth cannot be forgotten, for the Lord awakens the soul to His presence beside it. And even the favors that were mentioned became much more common since the soul goes about almost continually with actual love for the One who it sees and understands is at its side.
5. In sum, with respect to the soul's gain, the vision is seen to be a most wonderful and highly valuable favor. The soul thanks the Lord that He gives the vision without any merits on its part and would not exchange that blessing for any earthly treasure or delight. Thus, when the Lord is pleased to take the vision away, the soul feels very much alone. But all the efforts it could possibly make are of little avail in bringing back that companionship. The Lord gives it when He desires, and it cannot be acquired. Sometimes also the vision is of some saint, and this too is most beneficial.
6. You will ask how if nothing is seen one knows that it is Christ, or a saint, or His most glorious Mother. This, the soul will not know how to explain, nor can it understand how it knows, but it does know with the greatest certitude. It seems easier for the soul to know when the Lord speaks; but what is more amazing is that it knows the saint, who doesn't speak but seemingly is placed there by the Lord as a help to it and as",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,24,0,4,25,1,0,2,20,11,8,23,6,3,2,2,1,1,2,0
"799",1577,191,"its companion. Thus there are other spiritual things that one doesn't know how to explain, but through them one knows how lowly our nature is when there is question of understanding the sublime grandeurs of God, for we are incapable even of understanding these spiritual things. But let the one to whom His Majesty gives these favors receive them with admiration and praise for Him. Thus He grants the soul particular graces through these favors. For since the favors are not granted to all, they should be highly esteemed; and one should strive to perform greater services since God in so many ways helps the soul to perform these services. Hence the soul doesn't consider itself to be any greater because of this, and it thinks that it is the one who serves God the least among all who are in the world. This soul thinks that it is more obligated to Him than anyone, and any fault it commits pierces to the core of its being, and very rightly so.
7. These effects from the vision that were mentioned and that are left in the soul can be recognized by anyone of you whom the Lord has brought by this road. Through them you can know that the vision is not an illusion or a fancy. As I have said, I hold that it would be impossible for a vision caused by the devil to last so long and benefit the soul so remarkably, clothing it with so much interior peace. It is not customary for something so evil to do something so good, nor can the devil even though he may want to. If he could, there would at once be some outward show of self-esteem and thought of being better than others. But that the soul goes about always so attached to God and with its thoughts so occupied in Him, causes the devil such rage that even though he might try he would not often return. And God is so faithful that He will not allow the devil much leeway with a soul that doesn't aim for anything else than to please His Majesty and spend its life for His honor and glory; He will at once ordain how it may be undeceived.
8. My theme is and will be that since, as a result of these favors from God, the soul walks in the way here mentioned, His Majesty will make it be the one to gain. And if He sometimes permits the devil to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,25,0,9,17,0,2,1,14,17,10,17,4,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
"800",1577,192,"tempt the soul, He will so ordain that the evil one will be defeated. As a result, daughters, if someone should walk along this road, as I have said, do not be astonished. It is good that there be fear and that we walk with more care. Nor should you be self-confident, for since you are so favored you could grow more careless. If you do not see in yourselves the effects that were mentioned, it will be a sign the favor is not from God. It is good that at the beginning you speak about this vision under the seal of confession with a very learned man, for learned men will give us light. Or, with some very spiritual person, if there be one available; if there isn't, it's better to speak with very learned man. Or with both a spiritual person and a learned man if both are at hand. And should they tell you the vision is fancied, do not be concerned, for the fancy can do little good or evil. Commend yourself to the divine Majesty that he not let you be deceived. If they should tell you your vision is from the devil, it will be a greater trial, although no one will say this if he is indeed learned and the effects mentioned are present. But if he says so, I know that the Lord Himself who walks with you will console you, assure you, and give the confessor light that he may give it to you.
9. If the confessor is a person whom, although he practices prayer, the Lord has not led by this path, he will at once be frightened and condemn it. For this reason I advise you to have a confessor who is very learned and, if possible, also spiritual. The prioress should give permission for such consultation. Even though, judging by the good life you live, you may be walking securely, the prioress will be obligated to have you speak with a confessor so that both you and she may walk securely. And once you have spoken with these persons, be quiet and don't try to confer about the matter with others; at times the devil causes some fears so excessive that they force the soul, without its having anything really to fear, not to be satisfied with one consultation. If, especially, the confessor has little experience, and the soul sees that he is fearful, and he himself makes it continue to speak of the matter, that",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,19,0,11,13,5,2,1,16,9,17,22,2,2,9,1,1,1,0,0
"801",1577,193,"which by rights should have remained very secret is made public, and this soul is persecuted and tormented. For while it thinks the matter is secret, it finds out that the visions are publicly known. As a result many troublesome things happen to it and could happen to its religious order, the way these times are going. Hence a great deal of discretion is necessary in this matter, and I highly recommend it to the prioresses.
10. A prioress should not think that since a Sister has experiences like these she is better than the others. The Lord leads each one as He sees is necessary. This path is a preparation for becoming a very good servant of God, provided that one cooperate. But sometimes God leads the weakest along this path. And so there is nothing in it to approve or condemn. One should consider the virtues and who it is who serves our Lord with greater mortification, humility, and purity of conscience; this is the one who will be the holiest. Yet, little can be known here below with certitude; we must wait until the true Judge gives to each one what is merited. In heaven we will be surprised to see how different His judgment is from what we can understand here below. May He be forever praised, amen. 1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. Your messenger is such a great traveler that although I thought he would arrive from Madrid tomorrow -- for I sent him there not knowing with whom I could entrust these business matters -- he returned today, Thursday. Together with your letter, I have to respond to some letters from Avila, so I won't be able to send them off until tomorrow at noon. Neither my eyes nor my head are up to doing any better; and please God the messenger will be able to leave tomorrow. I would have preferred to write to you at a leisurely pace and to Señora Doña María. Now I am almost well, for the syrup about which I am writing to our padre relieved me of that torment of melancholy and I think it also took away the fever completely.
2. The letter you sent written in your own hand made me laugh a little, for the melancholy had gone away. Don't tell Padre Fray Domingo, for I'm writing him a humorous letter; perhaps he will show it to you. I was certainly delighted with his letter and with yours, and even more so",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,1,12,0,4,19,0,0,2,14,8,9,7,7,3,0,1,3,2,0,0
"802",1577,194,"with yours in learning how that saint is now at rest and of her beautiful death. I am amazed that anyone could be grieving rather than envying her for such a great blessing. I am sorry about the great trial you have had, my daughter, and still must endure with so many business affairs and such important ones, for I know what it is. But I don't think you would feel any better if you had the quiet you speak of, but worse. Of this I am very certain, for I know your temperament and I accept the fact that you will have to suffer trials because in one way or another you must become a saint; and this desire you have for solitude is better than having the solitude.
3. Oh, if you could see the agitation going on -- although in secret -- in favor of the discalced friars. It is something to praise the Lord for. And it was all stirred up by those who went to Andalusia -- Gracián and Mariano. My delight is greatly tempered by the grief this will give our Father General, since I care for him so much. On the other hand, I see that without such favor we would be lost. Pray for this whole affair. Padre Fray Domingo will tell you what is happening and you will also find this out from some papers I am sending you. Whatever you write to me, you must send with a trustworthy person, very trustworthy; this is something most important, even if you have to delay sending it for a few days. It is to our disadvantage that Father Visitator is so far away. There are business matters that I believe I will have to send him by messenger, whatever the cost, for the substitute superior would not be able to handle matters like these. May Father Visitator be our superior for many years.
4. With regard to Padre Medina, have no fears; even if it were something worse I wouldn't be disturbed -- rather it made me laugh. I would be more sensitive to even a half word from Padre Domingo. This other one doesn't owe me anything, so I am not bothered that he cares little for me. He has never dealt with these monasteries so he doesn't know our situation. He cannot be equated with Fray Domingo who loves them as if they were his own and who has truly sustained them. You have had a real tumult to contend",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,7,3,13,26,2,3,5,11,4,18,15,9,3,2,2,1,0,1,0
"803",1577,195,"with, but there isn't a prioress who would not do the same for her house.
5. My best regards to Doña María de Samaniego and tell her that this world makes us realize that we can trust only in God. I believe all that you write about her and her sister. But it's good that more was not done, for we have to be grateful, and it would have shown a terrible lack of gratitude even to the bishop. As time goes on, the Lord will arrange matters in another way and we will be able to do something for the consolation of those ladies; I saw clearly that it would not please Señora Doña María. I thought of writing to her; I don't think it will be possible. Doña María Cibrián is dead; commend her soul to God. Send my fond regards to the prioress at the monastery of the Mother of God, for much charity has been shown us here through her recommendation. And since I am not up to writing on account of my eyes, ask her to pardon my not writing. Take care of your health, for I wouldn't want you to have to pay for all the trouble and the bad nights you've had.
6. Oh, how I long to travel up there some day, for we are not far away, but I don't see how this will be possible. Regards to my Casilda. If you think it appropriate, let her read the enclosed letter from her aunt, for I sent her aunt the one Casilda wrote to me. For some time I have been close to her and I would trust her in any matter. I think I've forgotten something. God be with you and may he who binds us in such intimate friendship preserve you for me. I don't know how I bear that close friendship you have with my padre. See how you have fooled me; I think you are a great servant of God. May he make you a saint.

Treats of how the Lord communicates with the soul through an imaginative vision; gives careful warning against desiring to walk by this path and the reasons for such a warning. The chapter is very beneficial.
 
1. Now let us come to imaginative visions, for they say the devil meddles more in these than in the ones mentioned, and it must be so. But when these imaginative visions are from our Lord, they in some way seem to me more beneficial because they are in greater conformity with our nature. I'm excluding from that comparison the visions the Lord shows in the last dwelling place; no other visions are comparable to those.
2. Well now let us consider what I have told you in the preceding chapter about how this Lord is present. It is as though we had in a gold vessel a precious stone having the highest value and curative powers. We know very certainly that it is there although we have never seen it. But the powers of the stone do not cease to benefit us provided that we carry it with us. Although we have never seen this stone, we do not on that account cease to prize it, because through experience we have seen that it has cured us of some illnesses for which it is suited. But we do not dare look at it or open the reliquary, nor can we, because the manner of opening this reliquary is known solely by the one to whom the jewel belongs. Even though he lent us the jewel for our own benefit, he has kept the key to the reliquary and will open it, as something belonging to him when he desires to show us the contents, and he will take the jewel back when he wants to, as he does.
3. Well, let us say now that sometimes he wants to open the reliquary suddenly in order to do good to the one to whom he has lent it. Clearly, a person will afterward be much happier when he remembers the admirable splendor of the stone, and hence it will remain more deeply engrained in his memory. So it happens here: when our Lord is pleased to give more delight to this soul, He shows it clearly His most sacred humanity in the way He desires;",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,10,0,2,20,1,0,0,10,7,8,8,8,4,2,0,0,2,0,0
"805",1577,197,"either as He was when He went about in the world or as He is after His resurrection. And even though the vision happens so quickly that we could compare it to a streak of lightning, this most glorious image remains so engraved on the imagination that I think it would be impossible to erase it until it is seen by the soul in that place where it will be enjoyed without end.
4. Although I say ""image"" let it be understood that, in the opinion of the one who sees it, it is not a painting but truly alive, and sometimes the Lord is speaking to the soul and even revealing great secrets. But you must understand that even though the soul is detained by this vision for some while, it can no more fix its gaze on the vision than it can on the sun. Hence this vision always passes very quickly, but not because its brilliance is painful, like the sun's to the inner eye. It is the inner eye that sees all of this. I wouldn't know how to say anything about a vision that comes through the exterior sense of sight, because this person mentioned, of whom I can speak so particularly, had not undergone such a vision, and one cannot be sure about what one has not experienced. The brilliance of this inner vision is like that of an infused light coming from a sun covered by something as transparent as a properly-cut diamond. The garments seems made of a fine Dutch linen. Almost every time God grants this favor the soul is in rapture, for in its lowliness it cannot suffer so frightening a sight.
5. I say ""frightening"" because although the Lord's presence is the most beautiful and delightful a person could imagine even were he to live and labor a thousand years thinking about it (for it far surpasses the limitations of our imagination or intellect), this presence bears such extraordinary majesty that it causes the soul extreme fright. Certainly it's not necessary here to ask how the soul knows, without having been told, who the Lord is, for it is clearly revealed that He is the Lord of heaven and earth. This is not true of earthly kings, for in themselves they would be held in little account were it not for their retinue, or unless they tell who they are.
6. O Lord, how we Christians fail to know you! What will that day be when You come to judge,",2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,14,1,7,17,3,0,3,15,9,7,12,10,11,5,0,2,2,0,0
"806",1577,198,"for even when You come here with so much friendliness to speak with your bride, she experiences such fear when she looks at You? Oh, daughters, what will it be like when He says in so severe a voice, depart you who are cursed by My Father?
7. As a result of this favor granted by God, let us keep in mind the above thought, for it will be no small blessing. Even St. Jerome, though he was a saint, kept it in mind. And thus all that we suffer here in the strict observance of the religious life will seem to us nothing; for, however long it lasts, it lasts but a moment in comparison with eternity. I tell you truthfully that as wretched as I am I have never had fear of the torments of hell, for they would be nothing if compared to what I recall the condemned will experience upon seeing the anger in these eyes of the Lord, so beautiful, meek, and kind. It doesn't seem my heart could suffer such a sight. I've felt this way all my life. How much more will the person fear this sight to whom the Lord has thus represented Himself since the experience is so powerful that it carries that person out of his senses. The reason the soul is suspended must be that the Lord helps its weakness which is joined to His greatness in this sublime communication.
8. When the soul can remain a long while gazing upon this Lord, I don't believe it will be experiencing a vision but some intense reflection in which some likeness is fashioned in the imagination; compared with a vision this likeness is similar to something dead.
9. It happens to some persons (and I know this is true, for they have spoken with me -- and not just three or four but many) that their imagination is so weak, or their intellect so effective, or I don't know what the cause is, that they become absorbed in their imagination to the extent that everything they think about seems to be clearly seen. Yet, if they were to see a real vision, they would know without any doubt whatsoever their mistake, for they themselves are composing what they see with their imagination. This imagining doesn't have any effect afterward, but they are left cold -- much more than if they were to see a devotional image. It's very wise not to pay any attention to this kind of imagining and thus",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,11,1,12,11,4,2,2,24,10,8,17,9,12,4,2,2,4,0,0
"807",1577,199,"what was seen is forgotten much more than a dream.
10. In the vision we are dealing with the above is not so: rather, while the soul is very far from thinking that anything will be seen, or having the thought even pass through its mind, suddenly the vision is represented to it all at once and stirs all the faculties and senses with a great fear and tumult so as to place them afterward in that happy peace. Just as there was a tempest and tumult that came from heaven when St. Paul was hurled to the ground, here in this interior world there is a great stirring; and in a moment, as I have said, all remains calm, and this soul is left so well instructed about so many great truths that it has no need of any other master. For without any effort on the soul's part, true Wisdom has taken away the mind's dullness and leaves a certitude, which lasts for some time, that this favor is from God. However much the soul is told the contrary, others cannot then cause it fear that there could be any deception. Afterward, if the confessor puts fear in it, God allows it to waver and think that because of its sins it could possibly be deceived. But it does not believe this; rather, as I have said concerning those other things, the devil can stir up doubts, as he does with temptations against matters of faith, that do not allow the soul to be firm in its certitude. But the more the devil fights against that certitude, the more certain the soul is that the devil could not have left it with so many blessings, as they really are, for he cannot do so much in the interior of the soul. The devil can present a vision, but not with this truth and majesty and these results.
11. Since the confessors cannot witness this vision -- nor perhaps, can it be explained by the one to whom God grants this favor -- they fear and rightly so. Thus it's necessary to proceed with caution, wait for the time when these apparitions will bear fruit, and move along little by little looking for the humility they leave in the soul and the fortitude in virtue. If the vision is from the devil, he will soon show a sign, and will be caught in a thousand lies. If the confessor has experience and has undergone these experiences, he needs little",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,22,0,14,18,5,2,1,9,7,10,12,8,3,2,0,0,0,0,1
"808",1577,200,"time for discernment; immediately in the account given he will see whether the vision is from God or the imagination or the devil, especially if His Majesty has given him the gift of discernment of spirits. If he has this latter as well as learning, even though he may have no experience, he will recognize the true vision very well.
12. What is necessary, Sisters, is that you proceed very openly and truthfully with your confessor. I don't mean in regard to telling your sins, for that is obvious, but in giving an account of your prayer. If you do not give such an account, I am not sure you are proceeding well, nor that it is God who is teaching you. He is very fond of our speaking as truthfully and clearly to the one who stands in His place as we would to Him and of our desiring that the confessor understand all our thoughts and even more our deeds however small they be. If you do this you don't have to go about disturbed or worried. Even if the vision is not from God, it will do you no harm if you have humility and a good conscience. His Majesty knows how to draw good from evil, and the road along which the devil wanted to make you go astray will be to your great gain. Thinking that God grants you such wonderful favors, you will force yourselves to please Him more and be always remembering His image. As a very learned man said, the devil is a great painter and that if the devil were to show him a living image of the Lord, he wouldn't be grieved but allow the image to awaken his devotion, and that he would thereby wage war on the devil with that evil-one's own wickedness. Even though a painter may be a very poor one, a person shouldn't on that account fail to reverence the image he makes if it is a painting of our every Good.
13. That learned man was strongly opposed to the advice some gave about making the fig when seeing a vision, for he used to say that wherever we see a painting of our King we must reverence it. And I see that he is right, because even here below a similar action would be regretted: If a person knew that before a portrait of himself another whom he loved manifested such contempt, he would be unhappy about the act. Well how much greater",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,6,15,2,18,21,2,5,4,16,9,19,15,11,8,3,0,0,1,1,0
"809",1577,201,"reason there is always to have respect for any crucifix or portrait we see of our Emperor? Although I have written of this elsewhere, I am glad to write of it here, for I saw that a person went about in distress when ordered to use this remedy. I don't know who invented a thing that could so torment a person who wasn't able to do anything else than obey, if the confessor gave her this counsel, because she thought she would go astray if she didn't obey. My counsel is that even though a confessor gives you such advice, you should humbly tell him this reason and not accept his counsel. The good reasons given me by that learned man I found very acceptable.
14. A wonderful benefit the soul draws from this favor of the Lord is that when it thinks of Him or of His life and Passion it remembers His most meek and beautiful countenance. This remembrance is the greatest consolation, just as here below it would be far more consoling to see a person who has done a great deal of good for us than someone we had never met. I tell you that so delightful a remembrance brings much consolation and benefit.
Many are the other blessings these visions bring, but since so much has been said about such effects, and more will be said, I don't want to tire myself, or tire you, but advise you strongly that when you learn or hear that God grants these favors to souls you never beseech Him or desire Him to lead you by this path.
15. Although this path may seem to you very good, one to be highly esteemed and reverenced, desiring it is inappropriate for certain reasons: First, the desire to be given what you have never deserved shows a lack of humility, and so I believe that whoever desires this path will not have much humility. Just as the thoughts of a lowly workman are far from any desire to be king since such a thing seems impossible to him, and he thinks he doesn't deserve it, so too with the humble person in similar matters. I believe that these favors will never be given to those who desire them, because before granting them God gives a deep self-knowledge. For how will he who has such desires understand in truth that he is being granted a very great favor at not being in hell? Second, such a person will very certainly be deceived",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,10,0,3,24,1,1,1,25,14,16,15,8,4,3,0,0,3,1,0
"810",1577,202,"or in great danger because the devil needs nothing more than to see a little door open before playing a thousand tricks on us. Third, the imagination itself, when there is a great desire, makes a person think that he sees what he desires and hears it, as with those who desiring something during the day and thinking a great deal about it happen to dream of it at night. Fourth, it would be extremely bold to want to choose a path while not knowing what suits me more. Such a matter should be left to the Lord who knows me -- for He leads me along the path that is fitting -- so that in all things I might do His will. Fifth, do you think the trials suffered by those to whom the Lord grants these favors are few? No, they are extraordinary and of many kinds. How do you know you would be able to bear them? Sixth, by the very way you think you will gain, you will lose, as Saul did by being king.
16. In sum, Sisters, besides these reasons there are others; believe me, the safest way is to want only what God wants. He knows more than we ourselves do, and He loves us. Let us place ourselves in His hands so that His will may be done in us, and we cannot err if with a determined will we always maintain this attitude. And you must note that greater glory is not merited by receiving a large number of these favors; rather, on the contrary the recipients of these favors are obliged to serve more since they have received more. The Lord doesn't take away from us that which, because it lies within our power, is more meritorious. So there are many holy persons who have never received one of these favors; and others who receive them but are not holy. And do not think the favors are given continually; rather, for each time the Lord grants them there are many trials. Thus, the soul doesn't think about receiving more but about how to serve for what it has received.
17. It is true that this vision must be a powerful help toward possessing the virtues with higher perfection, but the person who has gained them at the cost of his own labors will merit much more. I know a person or two persons -- one was a man -- to whom the Lord had granted some of these favors, who",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,1,10,0,7,21,0,3,2,16,9,16,7,8,2,1,1,1,1,1,0
"811",1577,203,"were so desirous of serving His Majesty at their own cost, without these great delights, and so anxious to suffer that they complained to our Lord because He bestowed the favors on them, and if they could decline receiving these gifts they would do so. I am speaking not of the delights coming from these visions -- for in the end these persons see that the visions are very beneficial and to be highly esteemed -- but of those the Lord gives in contemplation.
18. It is true that these desires also, in my opinion, are supernatural and characteristic of souls very much inflamed in love. Such souls would want the Lord to see that they do not serve Him for pay. Thus, as I have said, they never, as a motive for making the effort to serve more, think about receiving glory for anything they do. But their desire is to satisfy love, and it is love's nature to serve with deeds in a thousand ways. If it could, love would want to discover ways of consuming the soul within itself. And if it were necessary to be always annihilated for the greater honor of God, love would do so very eagerly. May He be praised forever, amen. For in lowering Himself to commune with such miserable creatures, He wants to show His greatness.

CHAPTER 10
 
Tells about other favors God grants the soul, in a way different from those just mentioned, and of the great profit that comes from them.
 
1. In many ways does the Lord communicate Himself to the soul through these apparitions. He grants some of them when it is afflicted; others, when a great trial is about to come; others, so that His Majesty might take His delight in the soul and give delight to it. There's no reason to go into further detail about each, since my intention is only to explain the different favors there are on this road, insofar as I understand them. Thus you will know, Sisters, their nature and their effects, lest we fancy that everything imagined is a vision. When what you see is an authentic vision, you won't go about disturbed or afflicted if you understand that such a thing is possible. The devil gains much and is extremely pleased to see a soul afflicted and disquieted, for he knows that disturbance impedes it from being totally occupied in loving and praising God.
His Majesty communicates Himself in other ways that are more sublime, and less dangerous because",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,3,18,0,9,25,4,1,3,12,10,16,11,8,4,2,0,0,1,4,0
"812",1577,204,"the devil, I believe, will be unable to counterfeit them. Thus, since these latter are something very secret, it is difficult to explain them, whereas the imaginative visions are easier to explain.
2. It will happen, when the Lord is pleased, that while the soul is in prayer and very much in its senses a suspension will suddenly be experienced in which the Lord will reveal deep secrets. It seems the soul sees these secrets in God Himself, for they are not visions of the most sacred humanity. Although I say the soul sees, it doesn't see anything, for the favor is not an imaginative vision but very much an intellectual one. In this vision it is revealed how all things are seen in God and how He has them all in Himself. This favor is most beneficial. Even though it passes in a moment, it remains deeply engraved in the soul and causes the greatest confusion. The evil of offending God is seen more clearly, because while being in God Himself (I mean being within Him) we commit great evils. I want to draw a comparison -- if I succeed -- so as to explain this to you. For although what I said is true, and we hear it often, either we do not pay attention to this truth or we do not want to understand it. If the matter were understood, it doesn't seem it would be possible to be so bold.
3. Let's suppose that God is like an immense and beautiful dwelling or palace and that this palace, as I say, is God Himself. Could the sinner, perhaps, so as to engage in his evil deeds leave this palace? No, certainly not; rather, within the palace itself, that is within God Himself, the abominations, indecent actions, and evil deeds committed by us sinners take place. Oh, frightful thought, worthy of deep reflection, and very beneficial for those of us who know little. We don't completely understand these truths, for otherwise it wouldn't be possible to be so foolishly audacious! Let us consider, Sisters, the great mercy and compassion of God in not immediately destroying us there, and be extremely thankful to Him, and let us be ashamed to feel resentment about anything that is said or done against us. The greatest evil of the world is that God, our Creator, suffers so many evil things from His creatures within His very self and that we sometimes resent a word said in our absence and perhaps with",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,21,0,18,20,4,10,1,24,6,8,20,11,6,6,1,0,0,0,0
"813",1577,205,"no evil intention.
4. Oh, human misery! When, daughters, will we imitate this great God? Oh, let us not think we are doing anything by suffering injuries, but we should very eagerly endure everything, and let us love the one who offends us since this great God has not ceased to love us even though we have offended Him very much. Thus the Lord is right in wanting all to pardon the wrongs done to them.
I tell you, daughters, that even though this vision passes quickly it is a great favor from our Lord if one desires to benefit from it by keeping it habitually present.
5. It also happens very quickly and ineffably that God will show within Himself a truth that seems to leave in obscurity all those there are in creatures, and one understands very clearly that God alone is Truth, unable to lie. What David says in a psalm about every man being a liar is clearly understood. However frequently the verse may be heard, it is never understood as it is in this vision. God is everlasting Truth. I am reminded of Pilate, how he was often questioning our Lord when during the Passion he asked Him, ""What is truth?"" and of the little we understand here below about this supreme Truth.
6. I would like to be able to explain more about this, but it is unexplainable. Let us conclude, Sisters, that in order to live in conformity with our God and Spouse in something, it will be well if we always study diligently how to walk in this truth. I'm not merely saying that we should not tell lies, for in that regard, glory to God, I already notice that you take great care in these houses not to tell a lie for anything. I'm saying that we should walk in truth before God and people in as many ways as possible. Especially, there should be no desire that others consider us better than we are. And in our works we should attribute to God what is His and to ourselves what is ours and strive to draw out the truth in everything. Thus, we shall have little esteem for this world, which is a complete lie and falsehood, and as such will not endure.
7. Once I was pondering why our Lord was so fond of this virtue of humility, and this thought came to me -- in my opinion not as a result of reflection but suddenly: It is because God is supreme",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,0,15,0,9,27,1,5,3,14,11,11,12,18,0,4,0,0,1,3,0
"814",1577,206,"Truth; and to be humble is to walk in truth, for it is a very deep truth that of ourselves we have nothing good but only misery and nothingness. Whoever does not understand this walks in falsehood. The more anyone understands it the more he pleases the supreme Truth because he is walking in truth. Please God, Sisters, we will be granted the favor never to leave this path of self-knowledge, amen.
8. Our Lord grants these favors to the soul because, as to one to whom He is truly betrothed, one who is already determined to do His will in everything, He desires to give it some knowledge of how to do His will and of His grandeurs. There's no reason to deal with more than these two things I mentioned since they seem to me very beneficial. In similar things there is nothing to fear; rather, the Lord should be praised because He gives them. The devil, in my opinion, and even one's own imagination have little capacity at this level, and so the soul is left with profound satisfaction.

CHAPTER 11
 
Treats of some desires God gives the soul that are so powerful and vehement they place it in danger of death. Treats also of the benefits caused by this favor the Lord grants.
 
1. Do you think that all these favors the Spouse has bestowed on the soul will be sufficient to satisfy the little dove or butterfly -- don't think I have forgotten it -- so that it may come to rest in the place where it will die? No, certainly not; rather this little butterfly is much worse. Even though it may have been receiving these favors for many years, it always moans and goes about sorrowful because they leave it with greater pain. The reason is that since it is getting to know ever more the grandeurs of its God and sees itself so distant and far from enjoying Him, the desire for the Lord increases much more; also, love increases in the measure the soul discovers how much this great God and Lord deserves to be loved. And this desire continues gradually growing in these years so that it reaches a point of suffering as great as that I shall now speak of. I have said ""years"" so as to be in line with the experience of that person I've mentioned here, for I well understand that one must not put limits on God; in a moment He can bring a soul",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,19,2,8,30,2,1,3,13,11,8,8,13,1,2,0,0,1,2,0
"815",1577,207,"to the lofty experience mentioned here. His Majesty has the power to do whatever He wants and is eager to do many things for us.
2. Well, here is what happens sometimes to a soul that experiences these anxious longings, tears, sighs, and great impulses that were mentioned (for all of these seem to proceed from our love with deep feelings, but they are all nothing in comparison with this other experience that I'm going to explain, for they resemble a smoking fire that though painful can be endured). While this soul is going about in this manner, burning up within itself, a blow is felt from elsewhere (the soul doesn't understand from where or how). The blow comes often through a sudden thought or word about death's delay. Or the soul will feel pierced by a fiery arrow. I don't say that there is an arrow, but whatever the experience, the soul realizes clearly that the feeling couldn't come about naturally. Neither is the experience that of a blow, although I said ""blow""; but it causes a sharp wound. And, in my opinion, it isn't felt where earthly sufferings are felt, but in the very deep and intimate part of the soul, where this sudden flash of lightning reduces to dust everything it finds in this earthly nature of ours; for while this experience lasts nothing can be remembered about our being. In an instant the experience so binds the faculties that they have no freedom for anything except those things that will make this pain increase.
3. I wouldn't want what I say to appear to be an exaggeration. Indeed, I see that my words fall short because the experience is unexplainable. It is an enrapturing of the faculties and senses away from everything that is not a help, as I said, to feeling this affliction. For the intellect is very alive to understanding the reason why the soul feels far from God; and His Majesty helps at that time with a vivid knowledge of Himself in such a way that the pain increases to a point that makes the one who experiences it begin to cry aloud. Though she is a person who has suffered and is used to suffering severe pains, she cannot then do otherwise. This feeling is not in the body, as was said, but in the interior part of the soul. As a result, this person understood how much more severe the feelings of the soul are than those of the body, and",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,10,2,13,7,1,1,5,22,10,4,9,6,2,5,12,2,6,1,1
"816",1577,208,"she reflected that such must be the nature of the sufferings of souls in purgatory, for the fact that these souls have no body doesn't keep them from suffering much more than they do through all the bodily sufferings they endure here on earth.
4. I saw a person in this condition; truly she thought she was dying, and this was not so surprising because certainly there is great danger of death. And thus, even though the experience lasts a short while, it leaves the body very disjointed, and during that time the heart beat is as slow as it would be if a person were about to render his soul to God. This is no exaggeration, for the natural heat fails, and the fire so burns the soul that with a little more intensity God would have fulfilled the soul's desires. This is true not because a person feels little or much pain in the body; although it is disjointed, as I said, in such a way that for three of four days afterward one feels great sufferings and doesn't even have the strength to write. And it even seems to me always that the body is left weaker. The reason one doesn't feel the pain must be that the interior feeling of the soul is so much greater that one doesn't pay any attention to the body. When one experiences a very sharp bodily pain, other bodily pains are hardly felt even though there may be many. I have indeed experienced this. With the presence of this spiritual pain, I don't believe that physical pain would be felt, little or much, even if the body were cut in pieces.
5. You will tell me that this feeling is an imperfection and ask why the soul doesn't conform to the will of God since it is so surrendered to Him. Until now it could do this, and has spent its life doing so. As for now, the reasoning faculty is in such a condition that the soul is not the master of it, nor can the soul think of anything else than of why it is grieving, of how it is absent from its Good, and of why it should want to live. It feels a strange solitude because no creature in all the earth provides it company, nor do I believe would any heavenly creature, not being the One whom it loves; rather, everything torments it. But the soul sees that it is like a person hanging, who",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,5,1,0,2,15,3,13,11,0,2,3,17,11,13,10,11,2,1,10,10,9,1,0
"817",1577,209,"cannot support himself on any earthly thing; nor can it ascend to heaven. On fire with this thirst, it cannot get to the water; and the thirst is not one that is endurable but already at such a point that nothing will take it away. Nor does the soul desire that the thirst be taken away save by that water of which our Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman. Yet no one gives such water to the soul.
6. Oh, God help me! Lord, how You afflict Your lovers! But everything is small in comparison with what You give them afterward. It's natural that what is worth much costs much. Moreover, if the suffering is to purify this soul so that it might enter the seventh dwelling place -- just as those who will enter heaven must be cleansed in purgatory -- it is as small as a drop of water in the sea. Furthermore, in spite of all this torment and affliction, which cannot be surpassed, I believe, by any earthly afflictions (for this person had suffered many bodily as well as spiritual pains, but they all seemed nothing in comparison with this suffering), the soul feels that the pain is precious; so precious -- it understands very well -- that one could not deserve it. However, this awareness is not of a kind that alleviates the suffering in any way. But with this knowledge the soul suffers the pain very willingly and would suffer it all its life, if God were to be thereby served; although the soul would not then die once but be always dying, for truly the suffering is no less than death.
7. Well, let us consider, Sisters, those who are in hell, who do not have this conformity or this consolation and spiritual delight which is placed by God in the soul; nor do they see that their suffering is beneficial, but they always suffer more and more. The torments of the soul are so much more severe than those of the body, and the torment souls in hell suffer is incomparably greater than the suffering we have here mentioned, and must, it is seen, last forever and ever. What, then, will the suffering of these unfortunate souls be? And what can we do or suffer in so short a life that would amount to anything if we were thereby to free ourselves of those terrible and eternal torments? I tell you it would be impossible to explain how keenly felt is the",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,22,3,23,15,1,3,13,9,2,12,11,11,2,1,3,5,5,1,7
"818",1577,210,"suffering of the soul, and how different it is from that of the body, if one had not experienced these things. And the Lord Himself desires that we understand this so that we may know the extraordinary debt we owe Him for bringing us to a state in which through His mercy we hope He will free us and pardon our sins.
8. Well, to return to what we were dealing with -- for we left this soul with much pain -- this pain lasts only a short while in such intensity. At the most it will last three or four hours, in my opinion, because if it were to last a long while natural weakness would not be able to endure it unless by a miracle. It has happened that the experience lasted no more than a quarter of an hour but left the soul in pieces. Truly, that time the person lost her senses completely, and the pain came in its rigor merely from her hearing a word about life not ending. This happened while she was engaged in conversation during Easter week, the last day of the octave, after she had spent all of Easter in so much dryness she almost didn't know it was Easter. In no way can the soul resist. It can no more do so than it can, if thrown in a fire, stop flames from having heat and burning it. This feeling is not one that can be concealed from others, but those who are present are aware of the great danger in which the person lies, although they cannot be witnesses to what is taking place interiorly. True, they provide some company, as though they were shadows; and so, like shadows, do all earthly things appear to that person.
9. And that you realize, in case you might sometime have this experience, what is due to our weakness, it happens at times that while in that state, as you have seen, the soul dies with the desire to die. For the fire afflicts so much that seemingly hardly anything keeps the soul from leaving the body. The soul truly fears and lest it end up dying would want the pain to abate. The soul indeed understands that this fear is from natural weakness, because on the other hand its desire to die is not taken away. Nor can a remedy be found to remove this pain until the Lord Himself takes it away, usually by means of a great rapture, or",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,4,12,4,15,10,2,2,2,11,3,10,18,7,1,1,5,3,9,0,0
"819",1577,211,"with some vision, where the true Comforter consoles and strengthens the soul that it might desire to live as long as God wills.
10. This experience is a painful one, but the soul is left with the most beneficial effects, and fear of the trials that can come its way is lost. When compared to the painful feeling experienced in the soul, the trials don't seem to amount to anything. The benefits are such that one would be pleased to suffer the pain often. But one can in no way do this, nor is there any means for suffering the experience again. The soul must wait until the Lord desires to give this favor, just as there is no way to resist it or remove it when it comes. The soul is left with greater contempt for the world than before because it sees that nothing in the world was any help to it in that torment, and it is much more detached from creatures because it now sees that only the Creator can console and satisfy it. And it has greater fear of offending Him, taking more care not to do so, because it sees that He can also torment as well as console.
11. Two experiences, it seems to me, which lie on this spiritual path, put a person in danger of death: the one is this pain, for it truly is a danger, and no small one; the other is overwhelming joy and delight, which reaches so extraordinary a peak that indeed the soul, I think, swoons to the point that it is hardly kept from leaving the body -- indeed, its happiness could not be considered small.
Here you will see, Sisters, whether I was right in saying that courage is necessary, and whether when you ask the Lord for these favors He is right in answering as He did the sons of Zebedee, are you able to drink the chalice?
12. I believe all of us, Sisters, will answer yes; and very rightly so, for His Majesty gives strength to the one He sees has need of it. He defends these souls in all things; when they are persecuted and criticized He answers for them as he did for the Magdalene -- if not through words, through deeds. And in the very end, before they die, He will pay for everything at once, as you will now see. May He be blessed forever, and may all creatures praise Him, amen. we are made one spirit with God",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,16,2,15,19,3,5,4,11,5,7,14,11,6,1,1,1,4,0,1

1. Although when I began writing this book I am sending you I did so with the aversion I mentioned in the beginning, now that I am finished I admit the work has brought me much happiness, and I consider the labor, though I confess it was small, well spent. Considering the strict enclosure and the few things you have for your entertainment, my Sisters, and that your buildings are not always as large as would be fitting for your monasteries, I think it will be a consolation for you to delight in this interior castle since without permission from the prioress you can enter and take a walk through it at any time.
2. True, you will not be able to enter all the dwelling places through your own efforts, even though these efforts may seem to you great, unless the Lord of the castle Himself brings you there. Hence I advise you to use no force if you meet with any resistance, for you will thereby anger Him in such a way that He will never allow you to enter them. He is very fond of humility. By considering that you do not deserve even to enter the third you will more quickly win the favor to reach the fifth. And you will be able to serve Him from there in such a way, continuing to walk through them often, that He will bring you into the very dwelling place He has for Himself. You need never leave this latter dwelling place unless called by the prioress, whose will this great Lord desires that you comply with as much as if it were His own. Even though you are frequently outside through her command, you will always find the door open when you return. Once you get used to enjoying this castle, you will find rest in all things, even those involving much labor, for you will have the hope of returning to the castle which no one can take from you.
3. Although no more than seven dwelling places were discussed, in each of these there are many others, below and above and to the sides, with lovely gardens and fountains and labyrinths, such delightful things that you would want to be dissolved in praises of the great God who created the soul in His own image and likeness. If you find something good",5,6,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,1,0,5,3,2,1,8,0,6,19,5,1,0,10,9,10,11,7,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"821",1577,213,"in the way I have explained this to you, believe that indeed His Majesty said it so as to make you happy; the bad that you might find is said by me.
4. Through the strong desire I have to play some part in helping you serve my God and Lord, I ask that each time you read this work you, in my name, praise His Majesty fervently and ask for the increase of His Church and for light for the Lutherans. As for me, ask Him to pardon my sins and deliver me from purgatory, for perhaps by the mercy of God I will be there when this is given you to read -- if it may be seen by you after having been examined by learned men. If anything is erroneous it is so because I didn't know otherwise; and I submit in everything to what the holy Roman Catholic Church holds, for in this Church I live, declare my faith, and promise to live and die.
May God our Lord be forever praised and blessed, amen, amen.

1. Apart from what I have read in many places, I have seen through experience the great good that comes to a soul when it does not turn aside from obedience. It is through this practice that I think one advances in virtue and gains humility. In obedience lies security against that dread (which for us as mortals living in this life is a good thing) that we might stray from the path to heaven. Here one finds the quietude that is so precious in souls desiring to please God. For if they have truly resigned themselves through the practice of this holy obedience and surrendered the intellect to it, not desiring any other opinion than their confessor's (or, if they are religious, their superior's), the devil will cease attacking with his continual disturbances. He will have seen that he is losing rather than gaining. Also, those restless stirrings within us, which make us fond of doing our own will and which even subdue reason in matters concerning our own satisfaction, come to a stop. Those who practice obedience remember that they resolutely surrendered their own will to God's will, using submission to the one who stands in God's place as",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,0,0,33,2,10,23,3,2,2,12,9,8,14,6,3,3,0,0,2,0,0
"822",1577,214,"a means to this surrender.
Because His Majesty, in His goodness, has given me light to know the rich treasure contained in this precious virtue, I have striven -- although weakly and imperfectly -- to obtain it. Yet, often the small amount of virtue I see in myself contradicts what I just said. For with some things they command me to do I realize that such striving doesn't suffice. May the divine Majesty provide what is lacking for the accomplishment of this present task.
2. While in St. Joseph's in Avila in the year 1562, the same year in which the monastery was founded, I was ordered by Fr. García de Toledo, a Dominican, who at the time was my confessor, to write of that monastery's foundation, along with many other things; whoever sees that work, if it is published, will learn there of those events. Now here in Salamanca, in the year 1573, eleven years later, my confessor, a Father Rector from the Society, whose name is Maestro Ripalda, having seen this book of the first foundation, thought it would be of service to our Lord if I wrote about the other seven monasteries that were since founded through the goodness of the Lord, and also about the first monastery of the discalced Fathers of this ancient order. And so he commanded me to write this. It seemed impossible for me to do so because I was so busy, both with correspondence and with other necessary occupations ordered by my superiors. I was recommending myself to God and somewhat distressed for being so useless and in such poor health. Even without this feeling of being useless, it often seemed to me because of my poor health and my lowly natural inclinations that I wouldn't be able to bear doing this work. While I was in this prayer, the Lord said to me: ""Daughter, obedience gives strength.""
3. May it please His Majesty that this be so, and may He grant me the grace to be able to recount for His glory the favors that through these foundations He has granted this order. One can be certain that this account will be given in all truthfulness, without any exaggeration, in so far as possible, but in conformity with what has taken place. For even in something of very little importance I wouldn't tell a lie for anything in the world. In this work that is being written for the praise of our Lord, any untruthfulness would cause me great scrupulosity. I",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,0,4,14,0,6,19,1,1,3,10,11,8,16,4,3,2,1,0,3,0,0
"823",1577,215,"believe that such a thing would involve not only a waste of time but deception concerning the works of God, and instead of being praised for them He would be offended. It would be a great betrayal. So that I might accomplish this task, may it please His Majesty not to let me out of His hand.
Each foundation will be expressly mentioned. And I will try to be brief, for my style is so heavy that although I may want to be brief, I fear that I will become tiresome and tire even myself. But because of the love my daughters have for me, they who will possess this work after my days are done will be able to put up with the style.
4. I do not seek my own benefit in anything, nor do I have any reason to do so, but only His glory and praise, for many things will be seen for which glory and praise should be given Him. Thus may it please our Lord that anyone who reads this will not think of attributing praise to me, since to do so would be against the truth. Rather, let readers ask His Majesty to pardon me for the poor way in which I have benefited from all these favors. There is much greater reason for my daughters to complain about this defect than to thank me for what has been done through these favors. Let us, my daughters, give all our thanks to the divine goodness for the many favors He has granted us. I ask the reader to recite a Hail Mary out of love for Him that it may help me to leave purgatory and reach the vision of Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit, forever and ever, amen.
5. Since I have a poor memory, I believe that many very important things will be left unsaid and that other things will be said that could be omitted. In sum, the work will be in accord with my lack of intelligence and culture and my lack also of the quiet necessary for writing. They also are ordering me, if the occasion offers itself, to deal with some things about prayer and how, by being deceived, those who practice it could be kept from making progress.
6. In all things I submit to what the holy Roman Church holds, with the resolve that before this work reaches your hands, my Sisters and daughters, learned and spiritual",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,2,18,0,4,23,1,1,0,9,10,12,10,7,1,2,3,2,2,2,0
"824",1577,216,"persons will see it. I begin in the name of the Lord, taking for my help His glorious Mother, whose habit I wear, although unworthily, and also my glorious father and lord, St. Joseph, in whose house I am, for he is the patron of this monastery of discalced nuns, through whose prayer I have been continually helped.
7. In the year 1573, feastday of St. Louis, king of France, which is August 24. May God be praised!
= CHAPTER 1

Begins With the Foundation of the Carmel of St. Joseph in Medina del Campo 
On the circumstances surrounding the beginning of both this foundation and the others.
 
1. From what I can understand now, the five years I spent in St. Joseph's in Avila after its foundation seem to me to have been the most restful of my life, and my soul often misses that calm and quiet. During those years some young religious women entered, whom the world, apparently, had already held in its grasp as was manifested in their display of its elegant and fashionable dress. Drawing them quickly away from those vanities, the Lord brought them to His house, endowing them with so much perfection that it was to my embarrassment. He did this until the number reached thirteen, which had been set as the maximum number.
2. It was a delight for me to be among souls so holy and pure, whose only concern was to serve and praise our Lord. His Majesty sent us what was necessary without our asking for it; and when we were in want, which was seldom, their joy was greater. I praised our Lord to see so many lofty virtues, especially the detachment they had from everything but serving Him. I, who was the superior there, never remember worrying about the necessities of life. I was convinced that the Lord would not fail those who had no other concern than to please Him. And if at times there wasn't enough food for everyone and I said that what there was should go to those most in need, each one thought that she could do without, and so the food remained until God sent enough for everyone.
3. With respect to the virtue of obedience, to which I am very devoted (although I didn't know how to practice it until those servants of God so taught me that I couldn't be ignorant as to whether or not I possessed it), I could mention many things that I saw there. One thing comes to",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,1,19,0,7,17,2,0,2,6,5,8,9,5,3,2,0,1,4,0,2
"825",1577,217,"mind now, and the incident came about in the refectory one day when they served us helpings of cucumbers. My portion consisted of one that was very thin and rotten inside. Secretly, I called a Sister, one of those with greater intelligence and talents, to test her obedience and told her to go and plant the cucumber in a little vegetable garden we had. She asked me if she should plant it upright or sideways. I told her sideways. She went out and planted it, without the thought entering her mind that the cucumber would only dry up. Rather, since she planted it out of obedience, she blinded natural reason so as to believe that what she did was very appropriate.
4. It occurred to me to charge one of them with six or seven contradictory duties. She undertook them, remaining silent, thinking it would be possible for her to do them all. There was a well with very bad water according to those who tried it, and it seemed impossible for the water to flow since the well was very deep. When I called some workmen to dig a new one, they laughed at me as though I were wanting to throw money away. I asked the Sisters what they thought. One said that it should be tried, that since our Lord would have to provide someone to bring us water as well as food, it would be cheaper for His Majesty to give us the well on the grounds of the house and that thus He would not fail to do so. Observing the great faith and determination with which she said it, I became certain. And, contrary to the opinion of the one who understood all about founts and water, I went ahead. And the Lord was pleased that we were able to put in a conduit which provided enough water for our needs, and for drinking, and which we now have.
5. I do not present this as a miracle, for there are other things I could tell, but to show the faith these Sisters had since the things did happen in the way I tell them. Nor is it my first intention to praise the nuns of these monasteries, for through the goodness of the Lord, all of them act in this way. And of these things and many others one could write at length, and with benefit, for at times those who follow will be inspired to imitate these Sisters. But if the Lord",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,3,3,2,2,9,0,4,17,0,1,1,10,9,15,9,4,1,3,2,0,1,0,9
"826",1577,218,"should desire this to be known, the superiors will command the prioresses that they write of it.
6. Well now, this wretched one was among these angelic souls. They didn't seem to me to be anything else, for there was no fault they hid from me, even if interior. And the favors, and ardent desires, and detachment the Lord gave them were great. Their consolation was their solitude. They assured me that they never tired of being alone, and thus they felt it a torment when others came to visit them, even if these were their brothers. The one who had the greater opportunity to remain in a hermitage considered herself the luckiest. In considering the real value of these souls and the courage God gave them to serve and suffer for Him, certainly not a characteristic of women, I often thought that the riches God placed in them were meant for some great purpose. What was later to come about never passed through my mind, because it didn't seem then to be something possible. There was no basis for even being able to imagine it, although my desires to be of some help to some soul as time went on had grown much greater. And I often felt like one who has a great treasure stored up and desires that all enjoy it, but whose hands are bound and unable to distribute it. So it seemed my soul was bound because the favors the Lord was granting it during those years were very great, and I thought that I was not putting them to good use. I tried to please the Lord with my poor prayers and always endeavored that the Sisters would do the same and dedicate themselves to the good of souls and the increase of His Church. Whoever conversed with them was always edified. And these were the things with which my great desires were fully taken up.
7. Four years later, or, I think, a little more than that, a Franciscan friar happened to come to see me, whose name was Fray Alonso Maldonado, a great servant of God, who had the same desires for the good of souls as I, but he was able to transfer them into deeds for which I envied him greatly. He had recently come back from the Indies. He began to tell me about the many millions of souls that were being lost there for want of Christian instruction, and before leaving he gave us a sermon, or conference,",3,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,17,0,5,24,0,1,3,13,6,11,16,8,1,0,3,1,1,0,0
"827",1577,219,"encouraging us to do penance. I was so grief-stricken over the loss of so many souls that I couldn't contain myself. I went to a hermitage with many tears. I cried out to the Lord, begging him that he give me the means to be able to do something to win some souls to His service, since the devil was carrying away so many, and that my prayer would do some good since I wasn't able to do anything else. I was very envious of those who for love of our Lord were able to be engaged in winning souls, though they might suffer a thousand deaths. And thus it happens to me that when we read in the lives of the saints that they converted souls, I feel much greater devotion, tenderness, and envy than over all the martyrdoms they suffered. This is the inclination the Lord has given me, for it seems to me that He prizes a soul that through our diligence and prayer we gain for Him, through His mercy, more than all the services we can render Him.
8. Well, going about with such great affliction, while I was in prayer one night, our Lord represented Himself to me in His usual way. He showed me much love, manifesting His desire to comfort me, and said: ""Wait a little, daughter, and you will see great things.""
These words remained so fixed in my heart that I could not forget them. No matter how much I thought about this promise I couldn't figure out how it would be possible, nor was there a way of even imagining how it could come about. Nevertheless, I remained very much consoled and certain that these words would prove true. But the means by which they eventually did never entered my mind. Thus another half year, I think, passed, and afterward there took place what I shall now describe.

CHAPTER 2
 
How our Father General came to Avila and what followed from his visit.
 
1. Our generals always reside in Rome and none ever came to Spain. So it seemed impossible that one should come now. But since nothing is impossible when our Lord wants it, His Majesty ordained that what had never happened before should come about now. When I came to know of it, I felt grieved. For as was already mentioned concerning the foundation of St. Joseph's, that house was not subject to the friars for the reason given. I feared two things: one, that our Father General",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,17,2,10,17,1,2,6,13,11,13,8,9,1,1,2,1,1,2,0
"828",1577,220,"would be displeased with me (and rightly so since he was unaware of how the things had come to pass); the other, that he would order me to return to the monastery of the Incarnation, where the mitigated rule is observed, which for me would have been an affliction for many reasons -- there would be no point in going into them. One reason should be enough: that in the Incarnation I wouldn't be able to observe the austerity of the primitive rule, that the community numbers more than 150, and that where there are few there is more harmony and quiet. Our Lord did better than I had imagined. For the general is such a servant of the Lord, and so discreet and learned, that he regarded the work as good; moreover he showed no displeasure toward me. His name is Fray Juan Bautista Rubeo de Ravenna, a person very distinguished in the order, and rightly so.
2. Well then, when he arrived in Avila, I arranged that he come to St. Joseph's. And the bishop thought it well that he be given all the welcome that the bishop himself would receive. I gave our Father General an account in all truth and openness, for it is my inclination to speak thus with my superiors, whatever might happen, since they stand in the place of God -- and with confessors, the same. If I didn't do this, it wouldn't seem to me that my soul was secure. And so I gave him an account of my soul and of almost my whole life, although it is very wretched. He consoled me much and assured me that he wouldn't order me to leave St. Joseph's.
3. He rejoiced to see our manner of life, a portrait, although an imperfect one, of the beginnings of our order, and how the primitive rule was being kept in all its rigor, for it wasn't being observed in any monastery in the entire order; only the mitigated rule was observed. And with the desire he had that this beginning go forward, he gave me very extensive patent letters, so that more monasteries could be founded, along with censures to prevent any provincial from restraining me. I did not ask for these, but he understood from my way of prayer that my desires to help some soul come closer to God were great.
4. I was not seeking these means; rather the thought seemed to me foolish because a useless little woman as helpless as I",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,14,0,4,12,0,0,2,13,9,14,8,6,1,3,0,0,3,0,0
"829",1577,221,"well understood that she couldn't do anything. But when these desires come to a soul, it is not in its power to put them aside. Faith and the love of pleasing God make possible what to natural reason is not possible. And thus in seeing the strong desire of our Most Reverend General that more monasteries be founded, it seemed to me I saw them founded. Remembering the words our Lord had spoken to me, I now perceived some beginning to what before I could not understand. I was very sad to see our Father General return to Rome. I had grown to love him very much, and it seemed to me I was left helpless. He showed me the greatest kindness, and during the times that he was free from his duties he came to speak about spiritual things as one to whom the Lord must grant great favors. In this house it was a consolation for us to hear him. Moreover, before he went away, the bishop, Don Alvaro de Mendoza, very devoted to favoring those who aim after serving God with greater perfection, asked him permission for the foundation in his diocese of some monasteries of discalced friars of the primitive rule. Other persons also asked for this. Our Father General wanted to do so, but he found disagreement within the order. And thus, so as not to disturb the province, he let the matter go for then.
5. After some days passed, I was thinking about how necessary it would be if monasteries of nuns were to be founded that there be friars observing the same rule. Seeing how few friars there were in this province, making me even wonder whether or not they were going to die out, I prayed to the Lord over the matter very much and wrote to Father General. In the letter, I begged him for this permission as best I knew how, giving him the reasons why it would be a great service to God. I pointed out how the difficulties that could arise were not sufficient to set aside so good a work, and suggested to him what service it would render to our Lady, to whom he was very devoted. She must have been the one who arranged it.

"830",1577,222,"any opposition, he made his permission subject to the approval, difficult to obtain, of both the present and the former provincial. But since I saw that the main thing was accomplished, I had special hope the Lord would do the rest. And so it happened that through the kindness of the bishop, who took up this matter as his own, both provincials gave their permission.
6. Well then, being consoled in having the permissions, my concern grew in that there was no friar in the province that I knew of who could begin this work, nor any layman who desired to make such a start. I didn't do anything but beg our Lord that he would awaken at least one person. Neither did I have a house or the means to get one. Here I was, a poor discalced nun, without help from anywhere -- only from the Lord -- weighed down with patent letters and good desires, and without there being any possibility of my getting the work started. Neither courage nor hope failed, for since the Lord had given the one thing, He would give the other. Everything now seemed very possible, and so I set to work.
7. O greatness of God! How You manifest Your power in giving courage to an ant! How true, my Lord, that it is not because of You that those who love You fail to do great works but because of our own cowardice and pusillanimity. Since we are never determined, but full of human prudence and a thousand fears, You, consequently, my God, do not do your marvelous and great works. Who is more fond than You of giving, or of serving even at a cost to Yourself, when there is someone open to receive? May it please Your Majesty that I render You some service and that I not have to render an accounting for all that I have received, amen. 1. Aspirations toward Eternal Life
 
I live without living in myself,
And in such a way I hope,
I die because I do not die.
 
Since I die of love,
Living apart from love,
I live now in the Lord,
Who has desired me for Himself.
He inscribed on my heart
When I gave it to Him:
I die because I do not die.
 
Within this divine prison,
Of love in which I live,
My God my captive is.
My heart is free
To behold my prisoner-God,
Passion welling in my heart,
I die because I do not die.
 
Ah, how weary this life!
These exiles so hard!
This jail and these shackles

"832",1578,1,"Teresa is writing a letter. If you could see the faces she's making while writing you would be delighted. However badly our fortunes go I don't allow them to tell her anything. Today is January 30. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity always, amen. Father Rector gave me a letter of yours that was certainly a great surprise to me. In it you mention that I have been trying to get Padre Gaspar de Salazar to leave the Society of Jesus and transfer to our Carmelite order, that God wants this and has revealed it!
2. As for the first, His Majesty knows -- and the truth of this will come to light -- that I have never wanted this, still less urged him to take such a step. When some of this news reached me, it did not come through any letter from him, and I became so disturbed and distressed that it did anything but benefit the poor condition of my health at the time. And my knowledge of this is so recent that you must have heard about it long before I did, I think.
3. As for the revelation you mention, I could not have known whether he had a revelation about the matter, for he had not written to me, nor had I any knowledge of his decision.
4. If I had received the ""revelation"" in his regard of which you speak, I would not have been so shallow as to think that for so slight a reason a great change like the one mentioned should be undertaken, nor would I have even told him about it. Thanks be to God, I have been instructed by many persons about the value of such things and the credence that should be given to them. I don't think Padre Salazar would pay any attention to them, unless there was another factor to be considered, for he's a very sensible man.
5. As for what you say about your desire that the superiors investigate, you are right, and you can order them to do so. Obviously, in my judgment, he wouldn't do anything without your permission or informing you about it. I will never deny the great friendship that exists between Padre Salazar and me or the favor he shows me. Yet I am certain that in what he has done for me he has been moved more by the service it renders our Lord and our Blessed Mother than by any friendship. Truly,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,5,9,0,2,19,2,0,0,17,4,15,12,9,1,3,0,1,1,0,0
"833",1578,2,"I think it has even happened that as much as two years went by without a letter passing between us. If the friendship is an old one, it is because in the past I was in greater need of help, for this order had only two discalced Fathers. At that time I would have had a greater motive for wanting him to transfer than I do now. Thanks be to God we have more than two hundred, I think, and among them not a few who are especially suited for our poor manner of life. I have never thought that the hand of God would be more sparing toward his Mother's order than to the other orders.
6. As for what you say about my having written so as to have it said that you were preventing him, may God omit my name from his book if such a thought even crossed my mind. Allow me to insist so that you may understand my point of view. It is that in my dealings with the Society I hold their concerns close to my heart and would lay down my life for them, as long as I understood that I would not by that be doing a disservice to God. His secrets are great, and since I have played no more part in this matter than that mentioned (and God is the witness), neither would I want any in the future. If I am blamed without being at fault, it would not be the first time. In my experience, when our Lord is satisfied, he makes all things smooth. I would never believe, except for very serious reasons, that His Majesty would permit that his Society go against his Mother's order, for he took the Society as a means to repair and renew it. How much less would he permit this for such a light matter. And should he permit this, I fear that what would be gained on the one hand, would be lost on the other.
7. We are all vassals of this King. May it please His Majesty that those belonging to his Son and his Mother be such that like courageous soldiers we look only at the banner of our King to follow his will. If we Carmelites truly do this, obviously those who bear the name of Jesus cannot turn away from us, a threat that has often been made to me. May it please God to preserve you for many years.

"834",1578,3,"favor you are always showing us, and so, miserable though I am, I pray to our Lord very much for you, and I beg you to do the same for me. For half a year there has been no letup in the rain of trials and persecutions coming down on this poor old woman, and now this business is for me no minor matter. Nonetheless, I give you my word not to say anything that would encourage him or tell someone else to do so, nor have I ever said anything to him.
Today is 10 February.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I read Father Provincial's letter more than twice, and I always find in it such a lack of openness and so much certitude about what never entered my mind that you should not find the distress it caused me surprising. But that doesn't matter. If I were not so imperfect, I would be delighted to suffer this mortification from you. Since I am your subject, you can mortify me. And since Padre Salazar is also a subject, it occurs to me that his plan should be cut short by his superior. This would be a better solution than having me write to those who are not subject to me to do what you want. This would be the task of their own superior, and they would be right in not paying much attention to anything I might say.
2. Certainly, I don't see any better thing to do. Nor do I understand your reasons for wanting me to write. Unless I could say I had a report from heaven that he should not do such a thing, there is nothing for me to do. As I have told you, there is no reason to go into detail about everything, for this would be offensive to someone to whom I owe a solid friendship. This is especially so, since as you said it is certain that from what he says and I understand, he would not make this change without informing his provincial. And if he has not said or written anything to him, it is because he is not going to transfer. And if the provincial can prevent him by not giving him permission, I would be offending a man of dignity and a good servant of God by defaming him in all our monasteries (assuming they pay any attention to me), because it is a",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,6,1,0,5,9,0,6,17,2,3,2,11,11,18,16,8,1,7,0,0,0,0,0
"835",1578,4,"detestable accusation to say that he wants to do something that he cannot do without offending God.
3. I have spoken to you in all truthfulness and, in my opinion, I have done what I was obliged to do as an honorable person and as a Christian (the Lord knows I am speaking the truth here). To do more than what I have done, I think, would go contrary to the honorable and Christian thing to do.
4. I have told you that when I do something that I think I must, God gives me the courage to undergo with his help all the conflicts that arise. At least I will not complain that they were not foretold to me or that I failed to do all I could, as I said. You would have had more fault for giving such an order than I for not obeying it.
5. I am also sure that if things should not turn out the way you want, I would be blamed just as much as if I had done nothing. Just to have spoken about the matter suffices for the prophecies to begin to be fulfilled. Well and good if trials come to me. I have committed enough offenses against the Divine Majesty to deserve more than might come.
6. But I do not think I deserve to receive trials from the Society, even were I to have had a part in this matter. It has little importance as far as your concerns go. Your foundations are from a higher source. May it please the Lord that mine will consist in never deviating from his will and that he always give you light for the same resolve. It would be a great consolation for me if our Father Provincial were to come here. For a long while now the Lord has not desired to comfort me with a visit from him.
Your honor's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I am sending money to Avila so that they may send this messenger to you, for these enclosed letters will bring you much happiness. I was overjoyed by them, and I hope in the Lord that my brother's arrival will bring you some relief -- a great deal -- from your trials. So many holy intentions cannot help but bring about much good, and I would rather see him and his family live peacefully in their own home than that they have the endowment of these",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,15,0,6,23,0,3,1,5,4,17,14,10,1,5,0,0,0,0,0
"836",1578,5,"other offices, for I see flaws in each of them. May the Lord be blessed who has so directed matters. I repeat that I am especially happy for Señor Juan de Ovalle and you. In sum, my letters must have been good for something, but yours have been of little help.
2. I wrote to Gonzalito through the inquisitor Soto. I still don't know whether the letter was delivered to him; I have received no news of him. Do you see now what God is working in Lorenzo de Cepeda? He seems to be looking more to his children's salvation than to amassing a fortune. O Jesus, how much I owe you -- everywhere that I look -- and how little I serve you! No happiness for me is greater than to see my brothers, whom I love so much, receive the light to desire what is best. Didn't I tell you to leave it all in the Lord's hands, that he would take care of it? So I advise you again to place your affairs in his hands, for in everything His Majesty will do what most suits us.
3. I'm writing no more for now because I've written a great deal today, and it is late. Indeed, I am happy in thinking about the joy you will have. May the Lord give us joys where they will last, for all those of this life are suspect. I am well and am in a hurry to buy the house; things are moving along. Regards to Beatriz.
Today is the nineteenth of October.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, mi padre, and may he give you health this Lent for the work I see that you have ahead of you. I am wondering if you will have to be moving from place to place. For the love of God watch out lest you have a fall along the way. For since my arm has been in the state it is, I am very careful in this regard. It is still swollen, as is also my hand, and covered with plaster, which looks like armor, and so I get little use out of it.
2. It's extremely cold here now, which it hasn't been except at the beginning of winter. In fact the weather has been so good that it was much colder, at least for me, in Toledo. This perhaps is due to the door you ordered us to have made for the little",3,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,3,12,0,0,18,0,0,0,5,6,4,10,7,8,0,5,4,3,2,0
"837",1578,6,"room next to the one you said should become the infirmary. After this was done, the little room is like a stove. Anyway, I have been getting along extremely well in this cold weather. You always meet with success in the orders you give. May it please the Lord that I meet with success in obeying you. I would love to know if Padre Fray Antonio de Jesús is continuing to improve and what has happened to Padre Mariano who has so forgotten me. Give my regards to Padre Fray Bartolomé.
3. I am sending along a letter that the provincial of the Society sent me about the Carillo matter, which displeased me so much that I wanted to send him a worse answer than I did. For I know that they told him I had no part to play in this proposal, which is true. When I heard about it, I got very upset, as I wrote you, and greatly desired that he not proceed any further. I wrote him a letter urging him as strongly as I could not to do so, as I swear in this response of mine to the provincial. Their attitude toward me is such that if I do not use strong words, they will not believe me. And it is most important that they believe me so that they don't keep thinking that I received the revelations they speak of and used them to persuade him, which is a big lie. But I tell you that I have so little fear of their threats that I am amazed at the freedom God gives me. So, I told the rector that neither the entire Society nor the whole world could keep me from carrying out something I understand to be for the service of God, but that in this matter I neither did nor would intervene.
4. The rector nonetheless asked me to write to Padre Salazar and say what I said in the enclosed letter, that he can not do what he proposes without incurring excommunication.
5. I asked the rector if Carillo knew of these briefs. He replied that he understood them better than I. I then answered that I was certain he would not do anything that would offend God. He replied that because of his great attraction he could be fooled and rush ahead with his desire. So I sent him a letter by the means which he used to send his.
6. Well, mi padre, see their simplicity. From certain indications",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,0,4,0,6,20,2,2,0,13,6,14,8,6,1,5,1,0,0,1,0
"838",1578,7,"I understood clearly that my letter had been opened, but I didn't mention this to him. I told him in my letter (knowing that they would read it) not to trust his brothers, that Joseph, too, had brothers. In fact, his own friends must have revealed his plan, and I am not surprised, for his brothers are extremely disturbed. They must be afraid that this might set a precedent.
7. I asked him whether there were not some in the Society who had become discalced friars. He answered yes, that some had become Franciscans, but that the Society had first dismissed them and that afterward they received the permission to enter the Franciscans. I said that the Society could do the same thing in this case. But they are not thinking of doing this, nor am I thinking of telling him not to pursue his plans but only of cautioning him, as I do in this letter and leaving the matter to God. If it is God's will, they will give their consent. Otherwise (as I say here in this letter), a transfer would certainly not be possible -- I have inquired about this. Those who are advising him must be basing themselves on the common law, as did another canonist who tried to persuade me at the time of the foundation in Pastrana that I could accept an Augustinian nun, but he was mistaken. The pope could give his permission, but I don't think that will come about, for they will block the way. Would you inquire about this and advise him, for I would be extremely disturbed if some offense were committed against God. I am sure that he would not knowingly do so.
8. I am very worried, for if he remains among them after they know of his desire to transfer, he will not have the credibility he is accustomed to. We couldn't allow him to join us save under the most favorable circumstances. And I am always aware of what we owe to the Society, and I don't think God would permit them to do us harm for a reason like this. But to refuse to receive Padre Salazar out of fear of the Society would be wrong and would be a poor recompense for his affection. May God direct everything; may he guide him. But I fear that Padre Salazar will let himself be prompted by some experiences in prayer that he mentions and to which he gives too much credit. I have very",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,3,8,0,10,11,6,1,0,16,4,20,12,13,0,2,0,0,0,0,0
"839",1578,8,"often mentioned this to him, but that's not enough.
9. I am also sorry that the nuns in Beas must have said something to him about this, so great was Catalina de Jesús' desire for him to transfer. The good thing in all this is that he is definitely a servant of God and if he is mistaken it is in thinking that this is what God wants, and His Majesty will look after him. But he has got us into trouble, and if I hadn't heard from Joseph what I wrote to you, believe me that I would have done all I could to prevent it. But even though I do not believe as much in those things, it costs me a great deal to try to dissuade him. Who can say that I would not be hindering some great good from coming to that soul? You should realize that in my opinion he does not have the spirit of the Society. I have always thought so.
10. Ardapilla wrote me about this matter telling me to try to get the ravens to write to Joanes asking him to send someone here to inquire about it. I would be delighted, as long as I didn't have to get involved, but so many difficulties came to mind that I excused myself as best I could. I realize that he did it for our good, but you know that if we don't get to the root of a thing there is no other way to provide a remedy, unless Paul lends a hand. May the Lord bring this about, for I desire it very much. I worry about being the obstacle causing everyone to suffer. I have at times said that it would perhaps be best for them to throw me into the sea, as was done with Jonah, that the storm might pass. Perhaps my sins have caused all this.
11. The prioress of Seville wrote to ask me to petition you to give permission for her to accept another sister of the Portuguese nun, Blanca, who is not old enough to enter, in fact must be far from it. This would provide a great help for them to pay the rent on the house. I don't recall how much it comes to. It wouldn't be a bad thing if the parents in paying the dowry for Blanca would lend the community what they would plan on giving for her sister, or pay the interest instead of providing for her food.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,5,8,0,8,14,1,0,1,10,4,21,14,8,1,4,1,1,0,0,1
"840",1578,9,"The nuns never finish speaking of how much they owe this Portuguese woman. You can consider this and do what you think best.
12. I don't know when to stop when I write you. My brother always tells me to give you his best wishes. Accept these now all together and along with them those of all the sisters. May our Lord watch over you and bring you here soon, for your presence is very necessary, both for my sake and for other reasons. I don't mean that there is any problem you do not know about. Doña Guiomar is doing poorly. She rarely comes here, for that humor from which she suffers is completely destroying her.
13. As quickly as you can send this letter for Padre Salazar by way of the prior of Granada, and insist that the prior give it to him secretly. For I fear that through the Society he will write to me again or to some of our sisters, and his code language is easy to decipher. You could send it by way of Madrid, paying good postage, urgently entrusting it to Roque and making use of this same muleteer; it will be safe. Be careful, mi padre, and don't forget, for it is important to send this letter to Padre Salazar and that he not take any further steps -- if he hasn't already. And you should delay giving permission, in my opinion, for all of this is for his greater good. May God also give you, padre mio, all the blessings I desire for you, amen.
It is the First Sunday of Lent.
14. This letter from Father Provincial and the reply may be useful to us some day. Do not tear it up, if you so think.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus To the very magnificent Señor Roque de Huerta, chief forest guard of the woods.
1. Jesus be ever with your honor, amen. Tomorrow, Monday, marks the eighth day since I wrote by way of the carrier from here informing you about what took place as regards the provincial Magdaleno, and I sent you the ordinance and notification given him. I don't know whether you have received these. I would very much appreciate your letting me know, for I am worried. What happened afterward you will see through these notes. I feel very sorry for these nuns, so much so that I don't know what to say, except that God must love them very much because he gives them so many",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,3,10,0,6,17,2,1,1,14,6,9,12,10,2,2,1,0,0,1,0
"841",1578,10,"and such long-lasting trials.
2. All these ten days since the provincial and Valdemoro have been here, they have done nothing but busy themselves with schemes, threaten the nuns, and seek out persons who will tell them about the penalties reserved for them if they do not obey and cast a vote contrary to the previous one they signed in an appeal to the royal council. Now that he has accomplished all that he wanted, the provincial is in a great hurry to go to Madrid to present the nuns' signatures to the council. I beg your honor, for goodness' sake, to do what is required to make the truth known and tell about how the signatures were obtained by force. This would be a great help to these poor nuns so that the council doesn't think the information presented by the Fathers is true, for all the things that were done added up to tyranny. If it is possible for Señor Padilla to see these notes, show them to him.
3. Here Magdaleno has said that he definitely carries a royal ordinance to imprison Padilla if he should find him here, that he was two leagues distant from Madrid when they called him back to give it to him, that Tostado has full powers over both the calced and the discalced Carmelites, and that Padre Fray John of the Cross has already been sent to Rome. May God in his power deliver him, and grant grace to your honor.
8 March
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
4. For the love of God I beg you to strive to make known briefly to the members of the council the force that was used with the nuns, for this is a very important point of the entire affair. It is a great wrong that they can get away with doing whatever they want, carrying on without justice and without truth in everything they have done, and there is no one showing compassion for these martyrs.
5. This was written three days ago, and that provincial is still tormenting the nuns. 1. Jesus be with mi padre and free him from this people of Egypt, for I tell you they have frightened me by what they have done with these poor nuns. I tried to get the nuns to obey because the scandal was already great. This seemed to be the best solution, especially to the Dominicans. From what I surmise these fathers are helping one another and have united against this reform. I am",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,3,11,0,3,19,1,1,0,7,11,7,7,9,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"842",1578,11,"tired of all their clamoring. To tell the truth the nuns have been suffering for a long time. Nonetheless, if I hadn't told them that in my opinion they would not do harm to their cause by obeying, I don't think they would have obeyed.
2. Since the discalced friars are no longer present, little progress has been made on their cause. In fact, I wrote to Roque and to Padilla that if what concerned the discalced friars were not resolved and the calced friars remained as visitators, the nuns' cause would make no headway. Even if the council did favor the nuns, it would be foolish for me to go there. Yet it would look very bad if I did not go but abandoned them after they suffered so much. In addition, I don't think I can shirk my duty, especially since I don't see things going in the right direction and the Lord must find some way of helping these souls. I pity them so much, for they are in distress as you can see through those notes.
3. For goodness' sake send Padre Germán to them that he might pray for them. He is now really out of prison. As for Fray John, I am very disturbed with the thought that they might find some other fault to accuse him of. God treats his friends terribly. Truly, he does them no wrong since that is the way he treated his Son.
4. Read this letter that a gentleman brought from Ciudad Rodrigo, for he came solely to speak about this nun. He has many things to say about her. If they are true, she will be most suited for us. She is bringing 450 ducats and a good trousseau as well. Alba is asking me for a nun. This aspirant would like to go to Salamanca, but she would go to Alba as well. In Salamanca, though, they are in greater need because of the bad state the house is in. She will be able to go wherever you decide to send her. I promised to beg you to admit her. She seems agreeable to going to either of the two houses.
5. Here in this house the talk is of two aspirants from Burgos with 1500 ducats. They say they are very good and the dowry is needed for some work projects including what needs to be done on the enclosure wall. With another nun, everything can be completed. Will you give permission for this.
6. Look at all",2,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,3,0,10,0,13,15,2,0,4,9,11,16,13,9,4,3,0,0,1,0,0
"843",1578,12,"the confusion stirred up by a member of the Society over a sister of the prioress of Beas. I asked the prioress of Medina to inquire. She will find out what is being said. They must know much more than we do. You should be careful about what she might do, for I tell you there are persons whose nature doesn't change. Well, even though Anne of Jesus saw her two or three times for a short moment, she must have been told about it. I answered as if I knew everything that I do now. In my hurry I saw that neither she nor her brother spoke of her. The brother belongs to the Society, and it seems good that they help each other.
7. I regret having had to go so long without confessing to you, for here I don't find confessors as I did in Toledo. This is a great trial for me. I wrote this yesterday, and now I am being told of so many things about the injustices being done to the nuns at the Incarnation that I feel great pity for them. I think some of the nuns in this house are afraid of falling into their hands, and I am not surprised by their fear, for they have reason to fear.
8. May God provide a remedy and watch over you. The night is far advanced, and the messenger will be leaving in the morning.
Today is 11 March.
Your paternity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. The concept that Paul has formed of Joseph's grandeur is most elevated. Nonetheless, there is a greater or less amount of good in the works we do for him, and we are not always aware of how upright our intention is. So it is necessary to proceed with caution as in all things and trust little in ourselves.
2. How he will laugh, mi padre, over all this foolishness, he who thinks he keeps this very much in mind. But with his other cares this could be forgotten, and it is good that I remind him; at least nothing is lost by my doing so. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. God was pleased that it wasn't my right arm that suffered the damage, and so I can write this. I am better, glory to God, and I can keep the Lenten observance. The gifts you are always giving me will help me do so. May our Lord repay you. Although you do this",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,13,0,10,18,4,0,5,14,5,6,10,8,3,2,2,2,0,0,0
"844",1578,13,"for me, Sister Isabel de San Pablo is so tempted to love me that she is happier than I about it. It is a great consolation for me to be in her company, which seems like that of an angel. It is a consolation as well to know that your health is good, as is also that of those ladies, whose hands I kiss many times. I often pray to our Lord for them and do the same for you.
2. I was most distressed to hear of the death of that lady. Not long ago I wrote to Señor Don Teutonio, in response to one of his letters, to congratulate him on the happy occasion of the wedding, for I owe him much. These people undergo great trials. It seems clear they are servants of God, since trials are the greatest gift God can give us in life. If this life that is so short serves for any good, it is to gain eternal life.
3. I praise our Lord that you are not careless about this truth. So I beg him that this may be always the case and also for those ladies. Lorenzo de Cepeda kisses their hands many times as well as yours.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus To the most illustrious Señora Doña María de Mendoza, my lady. Valladolid.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your most illustrious ladyship and give you strength to suffer so many trials, for certainly this has been a harsh blow. I have felt great pain over what yours must be. I trust in the favors our Lord grants you that he will not fail to console you in this affliction and remind you during this holy season of the sufferings His Majesty and his glorious Mother underwent. If we felt them as we should, we would suffer all the pains of this life with great ease.
2. I would love to be there in your company and help you by sharing your pain, although I have been doing so here. I had no other consolation than to beg St. Joseph and our Lord to be with you. All of us in our prayers have been careful to make supplications for you and for that holy soul. I hope the Lord has already called her to his side and that he wanted to take her out of the world before she knew more about the things that are in it. Everything comes to an end so quickly",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,18,1,8,28,1,0,3,6,3,8,12,9,0,1,4,2,8,4,0
"845",1578,14,"that if our minds were awake and enlightened, it would not be possible to feel sorry over those who die knowing God, but rejoice in their good.
3. I also felt sorry for the count, in judging only from what we see, but the judgments of God are great and his secrets we cannot understand. Perhaps his salvation lies in his being a widower. I think His Majesty takes special care over all your concerns, for he is a most trustworthy friend. We can be sure that he has considered what is most suitable for souls; compared to this nothing else merits much of our attention. Eternal good or evil is what matters, and so I beg you for love of our Lord not to be thinking of the reasons you have for being afflicted but in those you have for taking comfort. In doing so you will receive much benefit. Otherwise you will lose, and even do harm to your health, which you are obliged to look after, for we all prize it highly. May God give you many years, as we all beg of him.
4. These sisters and Mother Prioress kiss your hands many times; I kiss those of Señora Doña Beatriz.
Today is Wednesday of Holy Week. I did not write before this, because I did not think you would feel like reading letters.
Your illustrious ladyship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with you, my daughter, and grant you and all your daughters as happy an Easter as I beg him. For me it has been a great comfort to know that you are in good health. My health remains as usual, with my arm in bad shape and my head too; I don't even understand what prayers they are saying. Truly, this must be the best thing for me. It would be a consolation if my head were such that I could write a long letter, and send many greetings for everyone. Do so for me, and especially to Sister San Francisco whose letters are a delight for us. Believe me, during the time she was prioress she grew wings. Oh, Jesus, how alone I feel when I see you all so far away. Please God, we will all be together in eternity. I find comfort in the thought that everything passes quickly.
2. What you say about the fault you find with Fray Bartolomé's sisters amused me. Even though you could finish paying off the house with their dowries, it would not be",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,12,1,9,26,0,2,2,20,3,9,8,10,3,2,5,4,3,3,0
"846",1578,15,"permissible to accept them. Under no circumstances should you take anyone who does not have good judgment. That would go against the constitutions and bring incurable harm. Thirteen years old is very young -- I'm speaking of the other one; at that age they tend to change their minds a thousand times. You will have to see for yourself what is best. As for me, I believe that I want everything that is good for you.
3. Before I forget, I am not in favor of the sisters writing about prayer, for this has many drawbacks which I would like to tell you about. You should know that even though doing this amounts to nothing but a waste of time, it impedes freedom of soul and allows one to imagine all kinds of things. If I remember, I will mention this to our padre; and if I don't, you tell him. Important graces are never forgotten; and if they are forgotten, there is no reason to mention them. When they see our padre, it will be enough for them to mention what they remember. In my opinion, they are on a safe path, and if something can do them harm, it would be for them to give importance to what they see and hear. If they experience some scruple, they can tell you, for I so esteem you that if they trust you, God will give you the light to guide them. I insist so much on this because I understand the trouble they will run into from thinking about what they should write and from what the devil can put into their heads. If it is something very serious, you could write it down, but without their knowing this. If I had paid attention to the experiences of San Jerónimo, she would never have finished. And if some of them seemed true, I still was silent about them. Believe me, it is better to praise the Lord, who gives these graces, and when they have passed to get beyond them, for it is the soul that will experience the benefit.
4. What you tell me about Elías is good. But since I don't have your erudition, I don't know who the Assyrians are. My best regards to her for I love her very much, also to Beatriz and her mother. It makes me very happy when you tell me about yourself and the good news about everyone. God pardon those friars who harass us so much.
5. And don't believe",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,0,6,22,0,1,0,15,6,18,16,5,3,3,0,1,0,1,0
"847",1578,16,"everything they say down there; up here we are given more hope. And in this we rejoice, although in darkness, as Madre Isabel de San Francisco says. With this painful arm, my heart is very bad on some days. Send me a little orange-flower water, and pack it so that the container doesn't break. That is why I didn't ask you for it sooner. The angel water you sent was so exquisite that using it caused me scruples, so I gave it to the church for the celebration of the feast of the glorious St. Joseph.
6. Give the prior of Las Cuevas my best wishes, for I love this saint very much, and Padre Garciálvarez and my Gabriela -- certainly there is a reason why our madre calls her ""her Gabriela"" -- whose presence there I could easily envy if it were not for all the love we have for one another in the Lord and if I didn't understand that the affection she has for you and your daughters is so well deserved. And how Madre Isabel de San Francisco does so much to make us aware of this. Even if she had gone to your house for no other reason than to praise you and all your nuns to the skies, her journey there was worthwhile. But wherever you are, mi madre, you will be praised. Blessed be God who gave you so many gifts, which you use so well.
7. I ask mi madre San Francisco for prayers -- I cannot say more -- and for prayers from all the nuns, especially Sister San Jerónimo. Teresa asks for your prayers. Señor Lorenzo Cepeda is well.
8. Please God, mi madre, you will be able to read this, written so poorly and in great haste. What else could be expected?
Today is Friday of the Cross.
Send me only a little orange-flower water, until we see how it arrives.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
9. The secretary is Isabel de San Pablo, servant of your reverence and of all in your house. Madre mía, now I remember that I heard it said that in Seville there are some paintings that are large and well done, that Julián Dávila was praising them. Our madre told me to ask you for one of St. Paul. Send me one that is very beautiful. And pardon me, but it must be one that I will enjoy looking at. 1. Jesus be with your paternity, mi padre. After Father Prior from Mancera left, I spoke to Maestro Daza",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,1,17,0,3,21,0,1,0,5,10,9,7,7,5,6,0,2,1,2,3
"848",1578,17,"and Doctor Rueda about the matter concerning the province. I would not want you to do anything that could be considered wrong, for even if such a thing turned out well, it would grieve me more than all the things done to ruin our plans at no fault of ours.
2. Both of them say that it is something difficult to admit if the commission given to you does not make specific mention of your power to do so. Doctor Rueda especially is of this opinion, to which I adhere because I consider him wise in all matters. In short, he is a very learned man. He says that since one is dealing with a matter of jurisdiction it would be difficult to hold an election, for without the intervention of the general or the pope one has no power to do so and the votes would have no force. That is all they would need so as to have recourse to the pope and protest vehemently about passing beyond the boundaries of obedience and naming superiors without power to do so. It sounds bad, and he thinks it would be more difficult to get confirmation from the pope of such elections than it would to get permission to form a separate province. A letter written by the king to his ambassador would suffice for him to gladly grant it. This would be easy to obtain since the pope would be told of how the others are treating the discalced friars. It is probable that if one were to discuss this with the king, he would be happy to do so. That would be a great help to the reform, for the others would have more respect for it and not insist on saying that the reformed houses should be done away with.
3. Perhaps it would be good for you to speak of this with Padre Maestro Chaves and bring him the letter I sent you through Father Prior. He is very discreet and enjoys the favor of the king; perhaps he could obtain what we desire. The friars who are designated to travel to Rome could then bring a letter from the king about this matter, for in no way would I want them to fail to go. As Doctor Rueda says, the direct way to proceed is to address the matter to the pope or the general.
4. I tell you that if Padre Padilla and all of us had thought of seeking the king's help in this",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,2,0,5,1,10,11,0,1,3,6,7,27,12,4,0,6,0,0,3,0,0
"849",1578,18,"matter, everything would have been taken care of by now. And even you could speak to the king and to the archbishop. If the elected provincial needs to be confirmed by the king and enjoy his favor, it's better to seek this favor now. And if you don't obtain it, there would be less of a stir and less damage done than if the refusal came after the election. Our reputation would be stained, and you would lose credibility for having acted without authority and without good judgment.
5. Doctor Rueda says that even if the dominican visitator or another were to do the electing, that would be better than having the discalced friars elect their own superiors. In these matters of jurisdiction you have to insist, and it's important, that the head receive his powers from a legitimate source. In thinking that they will accuse you with good reason I become disheartened. I don't experience this when they accuse you unjustly; rather, I grow wings and take off. And so I couldn't wait to write this so that you will be very careful.
6. Do you know what crossed my mind? Perhaps the gifts I sent to our Father General were used against us (for they were very nice) and given to some cardinals. And the thought comes to me not to send anything until this matter is over. So it would be good, if the occasion presents itself, to give something to the nuncio. I notice, mi padre, that when you are in Madrid you accomplish much in one day. If you speak with this one and that and with the friends you have in the palace and with Padre Fray Antonio, whom you could get to speak with the duchess, much could be done toward getting the king to favor our cause. He wants the reform to continue. And let Padre Mariano speak with him and present our cause to him and beg him and remind him of how long it is now that that little saint Fray John has been prisoner. In their furor over the visitation, they do these foolish things, which they wouldn't be able to do if they had a superior. Well, the king listens to everyone. I don't know why we should neglect telling him about this and asking for his support, Padre Mariano especially.
7. But how I chatter on and what silly things I tell you! And you put up with it all from me. I tell you that I am",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,5,19,0,0,4,7,8,22,12,2,0,6,0,1,1,0,0
"850",1578,19,"terribly upset that I do not have the freedom to do myself what I am telling others to do. Now that the king is about to go so far away, I wish something could be done first. May God do it, as he can.
8. We are eagerly awaiting those ladies. The sisters here are determined not to allow your sister to pass by without giving her the habit. You owe them a special debt of gratitude. I have a high regard for this attitude of theirs. They are so many and in such need, but they set nothing above having someone from your family. Well, that Teresita, the things she says and does! I, too, would be delighted because I wouldn't be able to enjoy your sister's company in the place where she is going, and perhaps never because it is a very out-of-the-way place. Nonetheless, it depends on me, and I will oppose them, for she has already been accepted in Valladolid and will be fine there, and to keep her here would be a great disappointment for them, especially Casilda. We will keep Juliana here -- although for now I am not mentioning anything to the nuns about her -- because I think it would be too great a hardship for Señora Doña Juana if she were sent to Seville, and perhaps Juliana herself would regret this when older. Oh, how I am tempted to become disturbed about your sister, the one who is in the boarding school. Through failure to understand, she is refusing help and a life more peaceful than the one she has there.
9. My brother Lorenzo is bringing this letter, for he is going to Madrid and from there, I believe, to Seville. Would you kindly allow him to enter the monastery in Seville to see a little stove the prioress has made for cooking -- for they are raving about it -- and we can not make one like it here if he doesn't see it. And if it is all that I am told it is, it will prove a treasure for both friars and nuns. I am writing to the prioress to allow him to enter for this purpose. But if this doesn't seem to you to be a good enough reason, let me know, for he will be staying in Madrid for a few days. But if you saw what they are writing about it, you would not be surprised that here they want to have one. They",2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,2,2,4,0,6,19,2,0,3,10,12,17,13,3,3,1,0,0,1,0,1
"851",1578,20,"say it is better than Soto's little mule, and what more could one say of it. The prioress, I believe, is writing you, and so I have no more to say than ask God to watch over you for me.
10. The prioress in Alba is very sick. Pray for her; despite all they say about her, her loss would be a great one. She is very obedient, and where obedience is present, a simple word of advice is enough to take care of everything. Oh, what the nuns in Malagón are going through without Brianda. But I've laughed at the thought of their desire that she return.
11. Doña Luisa de la Cerda's youngest daughter has died. I'm extremely distressed over the trials God gives this lady. The only daughter she has left is the widow. I think it would be good for you to write and console her. We owe her much.
12. Consider the possibility of your sister remaining here. If you think this would be preferable, I will not interfere, especially if Doña Juana would like to have her close by. Since she already has it in mind to go to Valladolid, I fear that she will come to regret remaining here. She will learn of the conveniences they have there that we don't have here, even if they amount to no more than the garden, for the ground here is wretched.
13. May God watch over you, mi padre, and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen, amen. My arm is getting better.
Today is April 15.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
14. Doña Guiomar is here and feeling better; she longs to see you. She weeps for her Fray John of the Cross as do all the nuns. This has really been a hard thing to take. The Incarnation is getting back to life as usual. 1. Jesus be with your paternity, mi padre. Oh, how dreadful of you to write such a short letter when you had as good a messenger as Juan. I was delighted to see him and to hear especially about you. I've already answered, in the letter brought you by Father Prior of Mancera, some of the things you asked me about. I feel mortified that you would pay any attention to me. Do what seems best to you; that would be the better course to follow.
2. I am so fearful after seeing that from everything good the devil draws out evil. Until the hour of those fathers",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,2,12,1,9,13,4,1,3,12,5,13,8,5,5,5,3,1,2,0,0
"852",1578,21,"passes, I would not want there to be any occasion for more calumnies and abuse. As I have said at other times, they come out on top in everything. Thus, I won't be surprised by anything they do. It doesn't seem to them they are doing anything against God, for they have the superiors on their side. They don't care about the king, for they see that he remains silent despite all they do. And if they should dare do something against you, the results would be terrible. Apart from the great pain and affliction this would cause everyone, they would feel discouraged and lost. God deliver us, and I think he will; but he wants us to do what we can to help ourselves. This along with the other things I wrote you compels me not to beg you to come here no matter how much I desire this.
3. The prioress of Alba is very sick. It is there that you are most needed. I wish you could go there with more calm than is now possible, and I would not want you to leave Madrid until things become more stable, and Peralta goes away. I know what they did when the king sent for Padre Mariano, even though they are less bold in Madrid than here. Yet, it is hard for me not to be able to give joy to a mother, and such a mother. So I don't know what to tell myself except that one can no longer live in this world.
4. You ask if it would not be better for you to go by another way, since if you come here you will be going out of your way. I tell you I long to see those ladies, but if you have to accompany them, you can remain more hidden if you go the other way, for no monasteries of those blessed creatures exist along that route. If such were not the case, I would find it hard if to avoid going eight leagues out of your way you failed to grant me this favor and rest here some days, and provide us with this joy that all the sisters hope for, as I wrote to you through my brother who left today for Madrid.
5. Thirdly, you tell me that Señora Doña Juana is coming with her daughter. It seems to me this is a demanding trip (eighty leagues) that she is now planning, a trip she could avoid and thus not risk",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,9,12,3,1,3,8,7,24,17,3,2,2,3,0,2,0,0
"853",1578,22,"her health which we so prize. I have made that trip and did so surrounded with much comfort and diversion, for I traveled with Señora María de Mendoza; still, it seemed long.
6. You should know that I am determined not to let your mother go beyond Avila. It is really not necessary because Señora Doña María has her brother and another woman accompanying her. Everything has been taken care of there, and it would be a big mistake for her to so tire herself out now that she has already seen her daughter. It would be better to wait until the time for the taking of the veil when, God willing, the situation will not be so dangerous and you could accompany her more easily than now. Her health is so important to us that otherwise I would not dare give such advice. At least, I will make every effort to keep her from continuing on her journey after she arrives here. The journey this far, if the weather is good, is not long. And now I recall that if she comes by carriage, it is better to come this way, for there are no mountain passes as there are along the other road.
7. I have been wondering, if Señora Doña Juana does not come and only Señor Tomás de Gracián accompanies his sister, if it would not be good for Padre Fray Antonio to travel with them, for he is well now. You will say that he too is a discalced friar. But his white hair will be a safeguard for him against all gossip. If you are not involved, no one will pay any attention, for everyone is now concentrating on you. I will be happy to see him again, now resurrected. This is the thought that entered my mind. If it isn't practical, consider it foolishness, for I know no more than what I have said.
8. I tell you that I would be overjoyed to see Doña Juana, but I think we are taking a risk, especially if she wants to travel any further than here. God deliver me from myself, for I pay so little attention to my rest. May it please the Lord to give my soul rest in a leisurely visit with you.
9. In the letter sent you through my brother, I wrote of how difficult it seems to Doctor Rueda and Maestro Daza that you elect prioresses without orders from the pope or the general, since it is a matter of",2,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,2,6,0,6,15,1,1,0,13,5,16,15,4,4,2,1,1,4,0,0
"854",1578,23,"their jurisdiction. Since I wrote at length about this, I'll say nothing but that you consider it, for the love of the Lord. You have a great deal of work and must always be so careful about everything. God will give us better times. For now, mi padre, we must take the path along which God may protect you. The prioress and subprioress sent you letters through my brother. If you need anything from the judge Covarrubias, you must tell my brother for they are good friends.
The Lord be with you and keep you many years for me and with much holiness.
Today is April 17.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter.
Teresa of Jesus
10. You should know, mi padre, that I am very sorry that I didn't know that Señora Doña Juana was going to come so soon. We've got the choir all exposed and the turmoil of workmen coming and going and the grilles removed. I was very happy at the thought of being able to have her here: what a life! It became impossible to stay in the choir because of either the cold or the heat. That will now be taken care of. See if it is possible to authorize Doña María to enter inside when here, for although everything is a mess, it will help her appreciate the house in Valladolid. 1. Jesus be with your honor. I would be foolish to deprive you of the joy of reading a letter from me by not spending some time to write you when so good a messenger is available. Blessed be the Lord who has arranged things so well. May it please His Majesty to do the same in everything else.
2. Don't you see how, even though you didn't want it, circumstances made it necessary for my brother to come here? And it may be that he will have to come again to get the money, although there may be someone through whom he can send it. He will bring you news about your son. Everything that could bring one joy is going well now; may the same be true regarding the soul's progress. Go to confession in preparation for Christmas and pray for me.
3. Don't you see that however much I try, His Majesty doesn't want me to be poor? I tell you, indeed, that in a certain sense this gives me great displeasure, but it removes the scruples I undergo when I have to spend something. I am thinking now of some little things I got for",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,4,11,0,5,20,1,0,1,9,4,12,14,13,3,3,1,0,1,1,0
"855",1578,24,"you, of what I paid and what was left and the greater amount I spent on the needs of the order, and, so as not to go around with these scruples, to keep account of what I have to spend otherwise. For if I do have money, I cannot keep anything when I see the great need at the Incarnation. And no matter how much I try, I cannot get fifty ducats for what I claim is necessary, not for getting what I want but for what pertains to the greater service of God. That is the truth. May His Majesty guide us and make you holy and give you a happy Christmas.
4. I don't like these plans of which my brother speaks. It would involve going outside your own house and spending more than he would make. And you would be alone, and we would all be anxious. Let us wait now to see what the Lord does. Try to please the Lord, for he will take care of your affairs. And don't forget that all things come to an end. Don't fear that your children will be left in want if you seek to please His Majesty. My regards to Beatriz. May he watch over you all. Amen.
5. One thing I ask you out of charity is that you do not love me for the sake of what you can gain in the world but because I pray for you. When it comes to anything else, there's nothing I can do -- regardless of what Señor Godínez says -- and it distresses me. I follow the one who governs my soul, and not whatever happens to enter the head of this one or another. I say this so that you may respond when something is said to you. You should understand that if we consider how the world is now and the state the Lord has placed me in, the less you think I do for you the better it is for me; and this is fitting for the service of the Lord. Certainly, even if I should do nothing, it would be enough for someone to imagine the least little thing so as to say about me what I hear said about others. So you have to be careful in regard to the little thing you mentioned to me.
6. Believe me that I truly love you and that sometimes I put together some trifle for a moment in which it will bring you pleasure. But",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,7,11,0,4,15,3,0,1,5,5,16,15,7,3,7,0,1,0,2,0
"856",1578,25,"explain when someone mentions it to you that I must spend what I have at my disposal for the order, for it belongs to the order. And how do others have a say in this matter? Realize that someone as exposed to the world as I am has to be careful even in the way she practices virtue. You'd be unable to believe the trouble I have. But, then, I do things so as to serve God. His Majesty will watch over you and your affairs for me.
7. May God keep you; I've gone on at length and the bell for Matins has rung. I assure you that when I see a postulant bringing with her something of value, I think of you and Beatriz, but I would never take anything, not even by paying for it with my money.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus To the very magnificent and reverend Señor Licentiate Gaspar de Villanueva, mi señor in Malagón.
1. Jesus be with your honor, mi padre. I assure you that if the condition of my head matched my desire to write to you at length, this would not be so short. I was very happy to receive your letter.
2. As for the matter concerning your sister, and my daughter, I am glad that it doesn't depend on you or her. I don't know what all the fuss is about or on what grounds the Mother President is basing herself. The Mother Prioress, Brianda, wrote me about this; I am answering her. I suggest that you do what she says in a letter she will write you, if you are in agreement. And if you are not, whatever the decision, I don't want to speak any more about this matter.
3. Concerning Sister Mariana, my desire is that she make profession according to her rank. As long as she knows how to recite the psalms and is attentive to all the rest, nothing else is required, I'm sure. Other professions have been made under the same conditions with the approval of learned men. I will tell this to the Mother President, unless you disagree. And if you do I submit in advance to your orders.
4. I beg you to give my regards to Sister Juana Bautista and to Beatriz. Since the nuns have you there, they don't need to go to Mother about their interior life, because it seems they don't feel consoled with her. I want them to stop their complaining! This woman is not killing them, nor is she neglecting",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,4,6,1,5,11,0,1,1,12,7,12,16,7,2,3,1,1,1,0,0
"857",1578,26,"the house, nor does she fail to provide for their needs, for she is very charitable. I have come to understand the nuns in that house, but until Padre Visitator goes there nothing can be done.
5. Oh, mi padre, what a trial it is to see so much instability in the nuns in that house. And how many things they found insufferable in the one whom they now adore! They practice the perfection of obedience mixed with a great deal of self love. And so God punishes them in the very thing where they are at fault. May it please His Majesty to perfect us in everything, amen. These sisters proceed very much like beginners, and if they didn't have you there, I wouldn't be so surprised. May our Lord watch over you. Don't fail to write, for your letters are a comfort to me, and I have few consolations.
17 April.
6. I thought of answering Sister Mariana, but my head is certainly in no condition to do so. I beg you to tell her that if she behaves as well as she writes, we will pardon her not being able to read so well. Her letter consoled me very much. I am sending her in response the permission to make profession. Even if she cannot make profession in the hands of our padre, in the event that he delays a great deal in coming, you needn't prevent her from making it, unless you think otherwise. Your hands are good for giving the veil, and she should consider only that she is making her profession in the hands of God, as is true.
Your honor's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your paternity, mi padre -- and my superior, as you say, which delighted me and gave me a good laugh. Every time I think of this I am amused at how sincerely you seem to tell me not to judge my superior.
2. Oh, mi padre, what little need there was for you to swear -- neither as a saint nor much less like a teamster -- for I am fully persuaded. God who has given you the zeal and desire for the good of souls would not take it away when you deal with the good of your subjects. Now to set this aside, I only want to remind you that you gave me permission to judge you and think whatever I want about you.

"858",1578,27,"April 25, and she felt well, glory to God. I greatly enjoyed being with her, for every day I love her more, and find her better and wiser. As for our nun, she is so happy that her joy can not be put into words. After she entered, it seemed she had been here all her life. I hope in God she will become a great nun. She has a fine intelligence and is very capable.
4. I would so much like Doña Juana not to continue on, but you have inspired this angel with so much love for Valladolid that no pleas were sufficient to keep her here.
5. Oh, and Teresa, what she didn't say and do! But Doña María took it well, as a prudent person, saying that she would do whatever I wanted, but it was clear that she didn't want to stay.
6. I spoke to her privately about this house and told her many things about it and how it came into being almost miraculously and other things. She answered that it didn't matter to her whether she was here or there. We thought we had made progress with her, but I then saw her become sad. Well, she spoke privately with Doña Juana and asked her not to fail to bring her to Valladolid and that she not let this desire of hers be known.
7. It seemed to Doña Juana and me that there was nothing else we could do, for it could become a source of discontent for her to receive the habit here and afterward go there. Doña María told me clearly that she would find staying here painful, that she wouldn't be able to bear leaving the monastery she had entered. And so I believe Doña Juana will leave tomorrow afternoon with her daughter. I would very much have liked her to stay at least until Monday. But since I see the expense that would involve, I did not insist very much.
8. She is staying at my brother's house, and Aranda is taking good care of her. May God go with her, for I am concerned, although she arrived in good shape after the most difficult part of the journey. Please God the rest of the trip will not do her any harm, for she is healthy and has a strong constitution. I embraced her at the door -- for I am very fond of her -- when Señora Doña María entered. May God bring her back home safely, for she",2,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,1,9,0,5,25,0,0,2,13,4,12,9,4,2,4,1,0,3,2,0
"859",1578,28,"is precious. 1. By the power that I have from Father Apostolic Visitator, Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios, I give permission to Mother Prioress, Ana de San Alberto, to grant profession to Sisters Florencia de los Angeles and Inés de San Alberto and Francisca de la Madre de Dios; and I give them permission to make it.
2. May it please the Lord that this be for his glory and honor and that he give them all that is fitting for daughters of the Blessed Virgin, our Lady and Patroness, amen.
Dated in St. Joseph's in Avila on the 30th day of April in the year 1578. 1. Jesus be with your paternity, my good padre. The day before yesterday I learned that Señora Doña Juana arrived in Valladolid in good health. And on the vigil or feast of Saint Angelus, they gave the habit to Señora Doña María. May it please God to direct this to his own honor and make her very holy. The prioress in Medina also wrote me that they would have gladly given her the habit if she had so desired, but I don't think she would care for that. As I wrote to you, the nuns in Valladolid were very sorry that you did not go there. I already told them that you will go soon, with God's help, and certainly the need for you there is great. Once Tostado leaves, there will be nothing to fear.
2. I am writing to Padre Mariano that if he comes with the Sicilian he should arrange to have you come with them. For if he wants to reach an agreement on what he says in his letter, your presence will be necessary. I assure you that if what this friar says is true and we take these means, the negotiations with our Father General will most likely be successful. All the other possibilities seem to entail endless delay, and if after we pursue this course we find that it didn't work out for us, we will still have time. May the Lord guide things well.
3. If this padre doesn't come here, I wish you would arrange to see him. I think that in everything it is necessary that we speak together, even if what you do is right. A short while ago I wrote you at length and so today I am being brief, for today they brought me letters from Caravaca, which I have to answer, and I am also writing to",2,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,10,0,2,19,1,0,0,7,2,15,15,8,1,3,0,0,1,1,0

4. Oh, mi padre, I almost forgot! The woman came to cure my arm, for the prioress in Medina did very well in sending her. The cure involved a real struggle both for the woman and for me. I had lost the use of my wrist, for it has been a long time since I fell. So the pain and toil were terrible. Nonetheless, I rejoiced to feel some little part of what our Lord suffered. I think the effort was successful, although the tormenting pain is such that it is difficult to know if the cure is complete. I can move the hand well and lift the arm as far as my head, but it will still take time before everything is all right. Believe me, if this had been delayed just a bit more, I would have ended up crippled. In truth, I would not have been terribly distressed, if God so willed. There were so many people who came to see the woman in my brother's house that one didn't know how to manage them all.
5. I assure you, mi padre, that since your departure from here, sufferings of every kind have had their day. Sometimes it seems, when they come one upon the other, that the body grows tired and the soul fainthearted, although the will, in my opinion, fares well.
God be with you always. Pray for these daughters of yours. Today is the vigil of the Ascension. Doña Guiomar is doing better; she is here.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your paternity. After having written the letter enclosed with this one, I received today, the feast of the Ascension, your letters that came by way of Toledo. They caused me much distress. I tell you, mi padre, that what you mention is a reckless thing. Tear this up right after you read it.
2. You can well imagine the consequences with all his complaining about me of which I am getting mighty tired. Although I love him much, very much so, and he is a holy man, I cannot fail to observe that God has not given him a talent for discernment. Don't you see how much trust he placed in the more unruly nuns. And without further information he wants to do and undo. I am well aware that she doesn't have what it takes to govern. But her defects are not something that brings dishonor to the order, for it's an in-house affair. I had earlier written them",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,1,1,0,10,0,13,12,3,0,3,10,7,7,9,10,2,0,2,6,5,1,0
"861",1578,30,"that you would go there and resolve matters, and that they should speak about their temptations with their confessor and not with her.
3. To want Isabel de Jesús to rule over them and be their subprioress is sheer nonsense. During the few days that they did have her while Brianda was prioress there, these very same nuns were ever telling stories about her and laughing over it all. They will never respect her. She is good, but not suited for that charge. To take away the office from Ana de la Madre de Dios for only a couple of days is foolish and judging by his hurry to have her, Brianda will be back there shortly. It would be hard for me to see her brought back, for with the exception of her being brought there for the purpose of moving on as soon as possible to a new foundation, I greatly fear her being in that place because of the one who is there.
4. That she does nothing for the discalced friars only means that she is following your orders. As for the rest of the gossip, I don't think it has merit. Neither do I regret the way she behaves toward me, for I know her and she is by no means reserved but very straightforward. They must be telling him the opposite of what she says. You already know that Brianda wrote asking me to give her orders not to give anything to any discalced friar. Another nun wrote that they had spent more on the discalced friars than on all their sick nuns, and many of them were sick that year. It seems to me, mi padre, that even if St. Clare went there, they would find much to complain about because of the one who is there and their own stubbornness.
5. As for her not caring for the sick, that is a calumny, for her charity is great. I was very embarrassed, mi padre, by her predecessor, for all those things matter little as long as the honor of the house is not involved, especially in Malagón where everybody is passing through. What they are saying about honor is a pretext, for she went to Toledo for her health on the advice of her doctors. I truly don't know what you can do about this.
6. It pleases me to observe how Padre Fray Antonio took care to forbid any mention of Brianda, which was the best thing he could do. You should examine",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,2,4,0,8,14,2,1,1,11,5,10,6,8,1,3,1,0,5,0,0
"862",1578,31,"the situation carefully, for goodness' sake. The best thing to do would be to bring in someone like Isabel de Santo Domingo along with a good subprioress and remove some of those who are there. You need to write briefly to Padre Fray Antonio not to make any changes until you have carefully considered everything. I will write to him that I cannot do anything until I see what orders you give, and I will disillusion him about certain things.
7. In regard to the house, I felt sorry, for it is a pity that there has been no one to lament this. They could have built some part by now, and I just wish they would finish two suites of rooms and the enclosure wall. That would prevent all from being lost if the entire work can't be finished now. For they will be better off there, however little there is, than where they are now. Please write to them about this.
8. I don't know how, mi padre, you assigned him to a task in Malagón without first briefing him thoroughly. I admit I feel like a dunce; nonetheless, I think that to remove and replace the superior there and without rhyme or reason brings great discredit to the house. If I thought that N could amend her ways, it would be better for her to resume her office as prioress and finish out her term. But I have lost hope in her ever making amends. And Padre Fray Bartolomé de Jesús, and Fray Francisco de la Concepción, and Antonio Ruiz have so insisted that she not return there that I think it would be rash not to pay heed to them. Please look into this and do as the Lord enlightens you. That is what will be the best thing to do. I will beg him to give you light. But it's most necessary that you warn this father at once and see that Padre Fray Antonio does not make a martyr of that saint, for she certainly is one.
May God be with you always.
Your paternity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
9. I don't think it would be a mortification for Isabel de Santo Domingo to go there. She would bring order back into the house, and Brianda could go to Segovia, or María de San Jerónimo. May God take care of this. As for Isabel de Santo Domingo's health, that region is hot, and since she is so esteemed, the sisters will not dare say anything about her.",2,4,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,4,1,5,0,6,18,0,0,5,11,7,15,14,8,3,1,3,1,1,0,0
"863",1578,32,"I reopened this letter to cross out what I said about Mariano lest the letter get lost. I'm very much tried by him. 1. Jesus be with your paternity. I had already written this enclosed letter and wanted to send it when the discalced brothers arrived and gave me yours. I tell you your letters restored my health. For yesterday evening when I received letters from Malagón I so tired myself out in reading and answering them that my bad cold got much worse. And now yours brought me such delight that I feel much better. May God be blessed who gives you the health to serve him so well and benefit so many souls. This is a tremendous consolation to me. Nonetheless, I would like to see you come here, for since there has been no rainfall in that region, it must certainly be very unhealthy. I don't know what you can do down there that you cannot do here. But the Lord who foresees everything undoubtedly must have waited for this opportunity to benefit those souls. For your presence could not have failed but to bear much fruit.
2. I forgot to mention in the enclosed letter how displeased I was to learn that Fray Hernando Medina gave the habit to our nun. I don't know what obsesses that little prioress that she thinks she has to satisfy those friars. From the enclosed letter by Fray Angel you will see how they already knew that you were to come along with your sister. I have been happy that you didn't do so. Now is a much more favorable time to come. I have already written to Ardapilla asking him to urge you to come. In adding some foolish things, I said that you are obliged to come even if you don't want to, that there is no alternative.
3. I have already thought of how my daughter María de San José could help me get some rest. With her handwriting, ability, and joy, she would be a relief for me. God will be able to bring this about after she makes profession, even though it may not be so easy for young women to fare well with old women. I am even amazed that you do not get tired with me. But God provides for this so that I may bear with the life he gives me, one with so little health and satisfaction, save in this. I also believe that those who care for God's affairs and",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,11,0,6,20,1,0,2,9,5,9,6,5,2,2,2,0,7,0,1
"864",1578,33,"truly love him cannot but enjoy the company of anyone who desires to serve him.
4. It would distress me if Ardapilla were to come with his refrain about the Incarnation. I have written to ask you if he has the authority to give me the order to return there, and you do not answer. I want you to know that I will do what I can to refuse, for without the confessors there, and also without a change of obedience, it would be foolish for me to return. But if he obliges me under pain of sin to go, you can see what my situation would be.
5. For goodness' sake write to me clearly what I must and can do, for these are not things to write about so obscurely. And always pray for me very much for I am now very old and tired, but not in my desires. I will give the sisters your regards. I would like you to come with the prior of Mancera. I tell you, it seems to me that from now on you are wasting your time down there, for this is no longer the season for sermons.
6. What a stir those nuns are causing over a hundred reales. See if I am not right by saying that in these visitations it is necessary to proceed with great care in everything. It is very important that when another superior comes he find nothing to complain about. I felt disgusted, for the one who gave the reales, who was overseeing everything, could well have avoided that so much importance be attached to this. As for Fray Antonio, it doesn't matter, but when he reproaches me for even some small thing that involves my Paul, I cannot bear it. As for myself, I don't mind.
7. God watch over you, mi padre, for you do me a great favor in getting so fat, as those fathers tell me, despite all your work.
May he be always blessed. Doña Guiomar will be delighted with your letter. She is doing well.
Today is May 14, and I am your paternity's true daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
8. I hope that all of this I have now written will not do me as much harm as did the letter I wrote to Malagón, but rather good. With regard to founding a monastery in Villanueva, it would in no way be fitting if the Franciscans have become involved. For them it is an appropriate site and they will know how to help the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,8,0,8,19,2,1,0,8,4,17,12,11,3,1,1,1,3,1,1
"865",1578,34,"sisters beg. You are right; begging is a terrible thing in these little towns. The foundation in Madrid is the one that is important, and there is a good basis for our being able to make it at once. And believe in the importance of this, and also of giving something to Huerta. We will give you orders about this when you come. 1. Jesus be with your paternity. The padre who will take this letter is about to leave, and so I can't be long. I very much regret that no one told me last evening that he was departing today. I am better and so is the arm.
2. As for what you had to endure because of the cat, I am amazed that he spoke so unpleasantly of Esperanza. God forgive him. If he were as bad as he says, they certainly wouldn't have tried so hard not to lose him. I am glad you didn't send the letter to Seville. I think it's better to be completely humble in dealing with them, for we truly owe them much, and much is due to many among them. Judging from what I have seen, I don't think this father is very prudent, so I wouldn't want you to prolong any of your dealings with him.
3. They have also written me from Toledo where there are many complaints about me. The truth is that I did everything I could, and even more than I should have. And so I have concluded that the reason for the complaining about you and me is our great care not to cause them any displeasure. And I believe that if we had looked only at God and done for his service alone what so good a desire required things would now be more peaceful and everyone happier, for the Lord himself would have smoothed everything over. But when we proceed with human respect, the goal is never reached; in fact the opposite happens, as it now appears. It's as though what he wanted to do was heresy! As I told them, they are sorry that it has become known. Certainly, mi padre, they, and we too, have had many earthly concerns in this whole affair. Nonetheless, I am happy that things turned out this way. I would want our Lord to be satisfied.
4. I have already written you about how much the fathers of the Society here are insisting that Padre Mariano come to look at a fountain. They have been pressing",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,2,5,0,8,21,0,0,3,9,8,14,6,9,3,2,2,1,0,0,0
"866",1578,35,"him to come for a long time. Now he has written that he will come during the course of this month. I beg you to write and tell him not to fail to keep his promise no matter what, and don't forget.
5. I am shocked by this imprisonment of Fray John of the Cross and the slow pace of all our negotiations. May God provide a remedy. From Toledo they write me that Tostado has at last gone, although I don't believe it. They say he is leaving Fray Angel in his place.
6. I don't know what to think about your not coming here. I now see that you are right. But time is passing without anyone being sent to Rome. And we are all lost with hopes that will go on a thousand years. I don't understand what's going on or why Nicolao doesn't go, for this would not impede the other action. Now I see that you are more careful than anyone, but fulfilling one's obligations toward the general can in no way cause harm, and now is a good time. And if this is not done, I don't think all the rest will be of any lasting help. Diligent efforts are never wrong just because they are many.
7. It is an excellent idea to name this college St. Joseph. God reward you. This project will be great for the order. With regard to Toledo, things are going very well. The nun is obstinate, and the prioress is foolish in asking you if you want to initiate a lawsuit since the house and a large sum of money are involved. Doña Guiomar was delighted with your letter and I was too. I am not surprised.
8. That padre senses the difference that must be noted in Guadalajara between himself and Paul. The difference between the two persons is very great and the feelings of human nature are strong. I deeply wish you would be strong by treating him graciously, for I find him somewhat high-spirited in his speech. To put up with the weaknesses of each one is very important. May God give us the strength necessary to please him, amen.
9. I don't know how to answer you in regard to those nuns. Four hundred ducats for twenty! I wouldn't even want six hundred. It's necessary to await the decision of Doña María de Mendoza, who will not fail to do everything well. I deeply regret having to see such things in matters of income.
10. Antonia told",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,1,2,7,0,9,18,0,0,4,12,5,11,10,8,3,2,1,0,1,0,0
"867",1578,36,"us here about the many ordinances you had made so that we were all scandalized, so I sent to ask you about this. Believe me, mi padre, that these houses are doing well, and there is no need to burden them with more observances, for they would find it hard to take on any additional obligations. And don't forget this, but always insist that they keep the constitutions and no more, for they will be doing a lot if they keep them well. In matters concerning the nuns you can trust me, for from what is happening here I see what is going on there. However small the ordinance may be, it becomes burdensome, as it would first of all for me, unless you were to ordain it in the name of God.
May he preserve you for many years.
Today is May 22.
Your paternity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The Holy Spirit be with you, my daughter. I have received your two letters, the one by way of Madrid, the other brought this week by the muleteer who lives here and who is so slow that I get annoyed. All that you sent me is very good and arrived in excellent condition, including the water. It's excellent, but now there's no need for more; this is enough. I was pleased with the little jars you sent; now they suffice. Since I am better, I don't need to be pampered; some day I am going to have to be mortified.
2. The arm is getting better, although not so that I can dress myself. They say that with the warmer weather it will soon be all right. The box of gifts was well packed, and so too was all the rest. Don't think that I will eat all those preserves. In fact, I don't care for them, but never in my life will I stop wanting to give. Since there is no lack of business matters to be carried out, and the charity of others to lend us help is not as openly ardent as in mi padre, the prior of Las Cuevas, or in Padre Garciálvarez, everything is useful.
3. The design for the little stove was so clear that I don't think a mistake can be made. It is now being manufactured. All the nuns are amazed at your talent and they thank you very much, very much indeed, and I do too. Your love for me is obvious in the way you please me in everything. I really",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,2,7,0,4,19,0,1,0,5,4,9,8,15,1,1,2,1,1,1,2
"868",1578,37,"believe this, but I tell you that you even owe me more love, for I am astonished at how much I love you. Don't think that anyone surpasses you in this respect, for not everyone is to my liking the way you are. The unfortunate thing is that there is little I can do for you, since I am so wretched, but I take great care to recommend you to God.
4. I was disturbed by this heart trouble that you say you have, for it is very painful; and I am not surprised, with all the terrible trials you have suffered and your being very much alone. Even though the Lord has favored us by giving you the virtue and courage necessary to bear them, the body suffers from it. Be glad about one thing: your soul is now much more advanced -- and believe me I don't say this just to console you, but because I know it to be so -- and this, my daughter, never happens without great cost. The trial you are now going through is terribly distressing to me, for it is something disquieting for all the nuns. It's about time for some improvement. I hope in our Lord that she will be cured, for many afflicted with this illness get better, and it is very important that one allow oneself to be cured. God will provide, for perhaps he wants to give you this cross for a short while and will draw from it much good. I earnestly beg this of him.
5. Take note now of what I am going to say. Try to see her as little as possible, for with your kind of heart trouble it would be so harmful for you that you could end up in bad condition -- and note that this is an order. Choose two of the more courageous nuns to attend to her, and the rest should hardly ever see her. They should go about joyfully and be no more disturbed than they would if caring for a sick nun. And in a way they should feel less pity for her, since those who are in this state are less sensitive to suffering than those enduring other illnesses.
6. These days we are reading here of a monastery of our order where St. Euphrasia was a nun and in it was someone like this sister, and she was submissive only to this saint who in the end cured her. Perhaps there might be someone there",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,11,0,17,22,3,0,5,6,5,9,12,5,2,3,1,3,4,2,0
"869",1578,38,"whom she would fear. If in these monasteries there were no trials arising from poor health, we would have heaven on earth and no way to gain merit. Perhaps a thrashing will get her to stop screaming. This wouldn't do her any harm. You do well to keep her in a safe place. I have wondered if she isn't too sanguine, for I believe she was suffering from back pains. May God cure her.
7. Know that even though these are painful things to have to bear, they are nothing in comparison with the suffering I would go through if I observed there imperfections or restless souls, and since that is not the case, I don't get too disturbed over bodily illnesses. You already know that if you want to rejoice in the Crucified One you have to suffer the cross. It's not necessary that you ask for this -- even though Padre Fray Gregorio thinks it fitting -- because His Majesty leads those whom he loves along the same path as he did his Son.
8. The other day I wrote to Father Prior of Las Cuevas. Give him my best regards, and read this that I am writing to Padre Garciálvarez, and if you think it's all right give it to him. The condition of my head -- still filled with noises, although a little better -- keeps me from always writing to them, for I love them very much. Continue remembering me to them.
9. I was delighted that our padre gave orders that the two nuns who are so deep into prayer eat meat. You ought to know, my daughter, that it occurred to me that if I had them near they wouldn't cause so much commotion. The fact that the graces received by them are so plentiful makes me wary. Even though some favors may be true, I think the proper thing to do is pay little attention to them, and neither should you nor our padre give them much importance; rather, make little of them. And even when they are true, nothing is lost by so behaving. When I say ""make little of them"" I mean tell the two nuns that God leads some souls in one way and others in another and that this is not the path that leads to the greatest holiness, and that is the truth.
10. I was happy with what Acosta said and that he has such a good opinion of her. I wouldn't want him to speak much with",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,2,10,0,11,17,3,0,4,11,9,17,15,7,0,5,0,2,4,2,1
"870",1578,39,"her so that he not lose it if something does not come about, as happened to me in her regard. I do not say that she lost merit in my eyes, for I know well that even though the grace is often from God, sometimes her experience may be the fruit of her own imagination. I have forgotten when that which the other nun predicted is to come about. Let me know whether it turns out to be true or false, for with this carrier the letters are safe. Now it occurs to me that it would not be good for me to respond to Garciálvarez until you let me know whether he knows anything about these matters so that I might write him about them, but give him my best regards and tell him that I was happy to receive his letter and that I will answer him.
11. As for those two nuns who want to enter, be very careful about what you do. It's good that Padre Nicolao is satisfied with them. Our padre, please God, will be down there in September, and perhaps before since he has already received his orders -- as you will surely know, being there; do whatever he tells you. I truly regret having to see him among those people. How necessary prayer is. All the sisters send their warm regards.
12. Oh, Teresa, how she jumped up and down at receiving what you sent her! It's extraordinary, the love she has for you. I believe she would leave her own father to follow you. The older she gets the more she grows in virtue, and she is a very discreet little one. She now receives communion, and with no little devotion. But my head is getting tired, so I'll say nothing more other than may God watch over you, as I beg of him.
13. My best regards to all the nuns and to the Portuguese sister and her mother. Try to avoid stress and tell me how you are doing with your heart trouble. The orange-flower oil is very good. For several days my heart has been better, for after all the Lord does not want to give so many ills all at once.
Today is 4 June.
14. Look at what I beg of you in the enclosed note, or better, order you to do for the love of the Lord. You must act with great attentiveness, for it is something I was entrusted with by a person to whom I am",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,6,24,2,0,3,9,4,7,12,9,5,2,1,4,1,2,1
"871",1578,40,"very much obliged. I told him that if you do not manage to carry out the task, no other person will, and that I consider you skillful and lucky in carrying through on what you undertake. Set about this task with the greatest care, and you will make me very happy. Perhaps Father Prior of Las Cuevas will be able to do something, although the one whom I trust most is Padre Garciálvarez. It seems difficult, but when God wills a thing all becomes easy. This would be a wonderful consolation for me; and I even believe it would be of great service to our Lord since it is for the benefit of souls and will bring harm to no one.
15. What you need to get is a whole year of sermons preached by Padre Salucio of the order of St. Dominic, the best that can be had. And if you can't get so many, get as many as possible, provided they are very good. A year of sermons includes those for Lent, Advent, feasts of our Lord and our Lady, the saints for the year, and Sundays from Epiphany to Advent, and Pentecost to Advent.
16. I was asked to keep this mission a secret, so I wouldn't like you to speak about it save to those who can be of help to you. Please God you will have good luck in this, and if you send the sermons to me, do so with this man and pay a good portage, and always address your letters to St. Joseph's while I am here, which is better than addressing them to my brother, even though they be for him; this is the safest thing to do in case he is away. Well, since you can't send all the sermons, send as many as you can. The good things that Padre Garciálvarez and Padre Fray Gregorio say about you and your daughters is a great consolation for me -- as though being your confessors they could say otherwise! Please God what they say is true.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your honor. It has been a long while since I have been mortified as much as I was today with your letter. For I am not so humble as to want to be considered so proud, neither should you want to show your humility at such a cost to me. I have never desired so eagerly to tear up a letter from you. I tell you that",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,1,2,12,0,2,26,0,0,0,7,4,12,10,5,0,4,0,0,0,0,0
"872",1578,41,"you know well how to mortify me and make me understand what I am, for it seems to you that I think that by myself I am able to teach. God deliver me! I wouldn't even want to think of such a thing. But I realize the fault is mine, while not knowing whether the greater fault may be my desire to see you in good health. My foolish remarks could arise from this weakness and the love I have for you, a love that makes me speak freely, without reflecting on my words, so much so that I too felt scruples afterward about some of the things I spoke of with you. Were it not for feeling scruples about being disobedient, I would not respond to your request, for I feel very disinclined to do this. May God accept what I say, amen.
2. One of my great errors is to judge these matters of prayer from my own experience, and so you don't have to pay any attention to what I say. God will give you other talents than what he gives to a poor little woman like me. Although the Lord has given me the grace of experiencing him actually present, I find that I am loaded down with things needing my direct attention -- and neither persecutions nor trials would be as much an impediment. If these things are such that I can do them quickly, it very often happens that I don't get to bed until 1 or 2 AM, or even later. But afterward the soul is not obliged to attend to any other cares but only to the One whose presence it enjoys. This has done serious harm to my health, and so it must be a temptation, although it seems to me the soul remains freer, as when one has a very important and necessary business matter and finishes up with other things quickly so that they will in no way hinder what one understands to be the more important thing. And so I am most happy to leave all that I can for the sisters to do, even if it could be done better by me. But since that is not my goal, His Majesty makes up for it. I find myself notably more advanced in the interior life the more I try to withdraw from things. Even though I see this clearly, I often neglect to do it, and I certainly feel the harm and see that I could",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,3,8,0,8,18,0,0,1,19,5,12,14,5,3,4,4,0,4,2,0
"873",1578,42,"do more and be more diligent in this regard and find myself improved.
3. With this I am not speaking of serious things that one cannot avoid, and my error must also consist in this, for your duties are serious and it would be bad for you to leave them for someone else to do; of this I am convinced, although when I see you sick, I wish you had less work. Indeed it makes me praise our Lord to observe how diligently you attend to the affairs of your house. I am not so foolish as to fail to recognize God's great favor toward you in giving you this talent and the great merit you gain. It makes me very envious, for I wish my superior were like you. Now that God has given you to me as my superior, I would like you to take as much interest in my soul as you do in the spring, something that really amused me. But it is something so necessary for the monastery, that everything you do in that regard is worth it.
4. Nothing more remains to be said. Indeed, I speak to you in complete truthfulness as I do with God, and I understand that all one does to carry out well the office of superior is so pleasing to God that after a short time he gives the person so occupied as much as he gives to another after a long time. And I know this also through experience, as I mentioned before. But I always see you so busy that I suddenly got the idea to speak to you as I did. The more I think of it, the more I see, as I told you, how there is a difference between you and me. I will try to correct myself so as not to speak on impulse, for this costs me so dearly. As soon as I see you in good health, my temptation will cease. May God bring this about, as he can and as I desire.
Your honor's subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit always be with your honor, amen. I have written you letters by four different avenues, and in three of them I enclosed a letter for Señor Jerónimo de Cepeda. Because at least one of them will surely arrive, I'll not respond now to everything you have told me, nor will I say more about the good resolve our Lord has placed in your soul, about which I",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,2,16,0,7,26,1,1,1,7,5,6,6,13,4,6,0,0,2,0,0
"874",1578,43,"have praised His Majesty. It seems to me to be a sound decision. Indeed, the motives you mentioned made me think more or less of others there might be, and I hope in the Lord that this will all be for his greater service. In all of our monasteries we are praying especially and unceasingly that since your intention is to serve our Lord, His Majesty will bring you safely to us and guide you toward what will be most beneficial for your soul and for your children.
2. I have written earlier that already six convents have been founded, and two houses also of discalced friars of our order. I consider the latter to be a great favor from the Lord, for they are making splendid progress in the way of perfection. As for the communities of nuns, they all resemble St. Joseph's in Avila, for they all seem to be one. And it heartens me to see how our Lord is so truly praised and with such purity of soul.
3. At present I am in Toledo. It will be a year on the vigil of our Lady's feast in March that I have been here, although from here I made a trip to Ruy Gómez's villa; he is the prince of Eboli. A monastery for friars and one for nuns was founded there, and they are doing very well. I returned here to finish the work of getting everything in order for this house, which will be a very important monastery. My health has been much better this winter. The climate here is wonderful. If there were no other disadvantages -- you would not find it a good place for the education of your children -- you could settle here; at least I sometimes find myself wishing this because of the good climate. But there are places in the region surrounding Avila where you could reside during the winter months. This is what some do. As for my brother Jerónimo de Cepeda, I think, instead, that when God brings him back, he will enjoy better health if he settles here. His Majesty's will is done in all things, for I don't think I have had such good health in forty years, and I am keeping the observance with everyone else, which includes not eating meat except in cases of great necessity.
4. A year ago I had the quartan fevers, but they have left me feeling better. I was engaged in making the foundation in Valladolid, and Señora",2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,16,0,1,22,0,0,1,11,12,7,10,9,1,1,1,0,4,0,1
"875",1578,44,"Doña María de Mendoza, the widow of secretary Cobos, smothered me there with amenities. So when the Lord sees that it is necessary for our good, he gives health; when it is not, sickness. May he be blessed for everything. I was distressed that the illness you had was in your eyes, which is a painful thing. Glory to God that there has been so much improvement.
5. Juan de Ovalle has already written you about his trip to Seville. A friend of mine gave him such good instructions that on the very day he arrived he withdrew the silver. He brought it here where they will give him the money at the end of this month of January. The account of the duties that had to be paid was carried out in my presence; I will enclose it here. I did no small thing in managing these affairs. I have become so adept at bargaining and managing business affairs for these houses of God and of the order that I am abreast of everything. Since I consider your business affairs to be those of our Lord, I rejoice in knowing how to handle them.
6. Before I forget, after I wrote to you, Cueto's son died, who was still very young. There is no trusting in this life; so I am consoled every time I think of how well you understand this.
7. When finishing here I would like to return to Avila, for I am still prioress there and don't want to anger the bishop, for I owe him a great deal as does the whole order. I don't know what the Lord will do with me; I may have to go to Salamanca where they are giving me a house. Although I am tired, the good these houses bring about in the towns where they are located makes me, in conscience, want to do all that I can. May the Lord so help with his grace that I will be given encouragement.
8. In my previous letters I forgot to tell you about the good facilities Avila has for the education of children. The Jesuits have a school where they teach grammar and hear the confessions of the students once a week and make their students so virtuous that it is something to praise God for. The students also learn philosophy and afterward for their theology go to Santo Tomás. There is no reason to go elsewhere for studies and training in virtue, and the whole city is so",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,3,7,13,1,4,18,1,2,0,9,6,3,4,5,2,1,0,1,6,0,0
"876",1578,45,"Christian that it is an edification to outsiders: much prayer, many confessions, and a life of great perfection among the laity.
9. The good Francisco de Salcedo is there. You did me a great favor in sending such a nice gift to Cepeda. That saint never stops expressing his gratitude to you, and I don't think I'm exaggerating by calling him a saint. The elderly Pedro del Peso died about a year ago -- he was well advanced in years. Ana de Cepeda greatly appreciated the alms you sent her. With it she will indeed be rich, for other people help her since she is so good. She will not be lacking a place to stay, but she has such strange traits that she is not suited for community. God leads her by that path. I have never dared to take her into one of these houses, and not because of any lack of virtue in her, but because I see that she lives the life that best suits her. Nor will she stay with Señora Doña María or anyone else, and this is good considering her goals. She seems to live like a hermit, and with that goodness and dedication to much penance that she has always shown.
10. The son of Señora Doña María, my sister, and of Martín de Guzmán has made his profession and is advancing in holiness. And the daughter Doña Beatriz has died, as I have already written to you. Doña Magdalena, who was the youngest, lives in a monastery as a secular. I would love to see God call her to be a nun. She is very pretty. I haven't seen her for many years. Now they are speaking about a marriage for her with a certain widower who has a primogeniture. I don't know how things will turn out.
11. I have already written to your honor about how your assistance to my sister[16] arrived just in time. For I have been frightened by the trials of poverty that the Lord has given her, and she has born it so well that he now wants to give her relief. I have no needs but a surplus of everything, and so what you sent me in alms I will share with my sister, and the rest will go for good works according to your intentions. Because of some scruples that I had, your help came just at the right time, for these foundations make demands on me. However careful I am about using everything",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,3,11,2,2,25,1,0,0,6,12,5,6,8,3,1,0,0,2,1,0
"877",1578,46,"for them, I could give less away, such as in courtesy offerings to the learned men whom I must consult about my soul. In sum, the matter concerns trifles, but I was very relieved not to have to appeal to others. They would not fail to help me, but it pleases me to be free in dealing with these gentlemen so as to be able to tell them my opinion. And the world is so selfish that I, in a way, have a horror of possessing anything. So, I will not keep for myself anything of what you sent, but I will keep my freedom by giving some of it to the order. I have all the permissions I need from the general and provincial for receiving nuns, transferring them, and helping one house with the resources of another.
12. They are so blind in trusting me that I don't know how this trust could have come about, and there are people who will go so far as to lend me one or two thousand ducats. So, just at a time when I have come to abhor money and business affairs, the Lord desires that I deal with nothing else, which is no small cross. May it please His Majesty that I serve him in this manner, for all things will pass away.
13. Indeed, I think it will be a relief for me to have you here; since very few things of the earth provide me with it, perhaps our Lord wants me to have this consolation and that we both work together for his honor and glory and bring some profit to souls. For what greatly grieves me is to see so many souls lost, and I am very anxious about those Indians. May the Lord give them light. There is so much misery here and over there that, since I travel in many regions and speak to many persons, I don't know what to say except that we are worse than animals; we do not understand the great dignity of our soul and we undervalue it with things as cheap as those of earth. May the Lord give us light.
14. You can speak with Padre García de Toledo, whom I miss very much in my business affairs; he is the nephew of the viceroy. If you should need anything from the viceroy, know that he is a strong Christian, and it was a great stroke of fortune that he wanted to go over there. I put letters",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,1,7,10,1,9,17,3,0,5,6,3,11,12,4,2,3,1,0,2,0,0
"878",1578,47,"for him in the previous packages I sent. I also enclosed in each some relics for you for your journey. I strongly hope they will get there.
15. I hadn't thought of going on at such length. I want you to know of the favor God bestowed on Señora Doña Juana in granting her such a death. Here we have recommended her to the Lord and offered prayers for her soul in all of our monasteries. I hope in the Lord that she has no need of more. You should try very hard to put aside this grieving. Remember, it is those who do not recall there is an everlasting life that feel such pain when someone departs from the miseries of this life.
16. Best regards to my brother Jerónimo de Cepeda; this letter is for him too. You made me very happy in telling me that you have given orders so that he can return here within a few years, and I hope, if possible, that he will not leave his children there but that we will all be together here, to help one another so as to be together forever.
Today is 17 January 1570.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
17. Concerning the Masses, many have been said and the rest will be said. I took in a nun who had nothing for a dowry, not even a bed, and I offered this to God that you and your children will arrive in good health. Give my regards to them. I am making a similar offering for Señor Jerónimo de Cepeda. I receive many nuns in this way, if they are spiritual, and then the Lord sends others who provide the means for them all.
18. In Medina someone entered with a dowry of 8,000 ducats, and another entered here with 9,000 without my asking for anything. And these cases are so numerous that one can only praise God. If someone has the spirit of prayer, she seeks nothing else, so to speak, than one of these houses; and the number of nuns in them does not exceed thirteen. Since according to our constitutions we do not beg for alms, but we eat what is brought to the turn for us, which is more than sufficient, our number must be small. I think you will be made very happy when you see these houses. With regard to all that is given, no one demands an accounting, nor does anyone see it but me, and that means more work for me.

"879",1578,48,"Give my best regards to Señor Pedro de Ahumada. Because he can receive news about me from your honor and I have so little time, I am not writing to him. I am very concerned about Agustín de Ahumada since I do not know how he is faring in his relationship with our Lord. I pray a great deal for him. And I send regards to Señor Hernando de Cepeda. A daughter of his sister's recently married rather well. 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor, mi padre. I received your letter and with it your kindness and charity as always; of these you have shown me so much that I don't know what to say other than beseech God to repay you for them and for everything else.
2. As regards your visit here, I tell you that I felt so sorry to see you in the company of someone who caused you so much grief and to see the poor health you suffered while here. Save for a great need I would not have begged you to take a vacation at such a cost to yourself so as to please me. Now I have no need, glory to God, although business matters and troubles are never lacking and prevent me from enjoying the rest that I would like. So rather, I beg you not to come, but to consider where you would be happiest and go there, for one who works the entire year has need of such a thing. Besides if Father Visitator should decide to come while you are here, I wouldn't have much chance to enjoy your company.
3. Believe me, mi padre, I have understood that the Lord doesn't want me to have anything in this life but crosses and more crosses. And what is worse is that all those who desire to comfort me end up sharing in them, for I see that he wishes to torment me even in this way. May he be blessed for everything.
4. I deeply regret Padre Padilla's misfortune, for I hold him to be a servant of God. May it please the Lord to make the truth known. For anyone who has so many enemies undergoes much tribulation, and we all run this same risk. But it is only a small thing to lose one's life and honor for love of so good a Lord. Always recommend us to him, for I tell you everything is in chaos.

Your honor's unworthy servant and true daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
6. All these servants of yours entrust themselves very much to your prayers. Don't give your consent for the prioress to stop eating meat, and tell her to take care of her health. 1. May the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre, and give you strength to undergo this battle, for nowadays there are few whom the Lord allows the devils and the world to attack so furiously.
2. May his name be blessed, for he has willed that you gain so many merits all together. I tell you that if our nature were not so sensitive, reason would make us well understand the great motive we have for rejoicing. I am relieved to know that you do not fear excommunication, although I never thought that you could be excommunicated ...
3. May God watch over you and allow me to see you one day at a calm moment, if only for us to encourage each other so as to return to suffering. All the nuns send their best regards.
4. Please God you will respond to everything, for you have become very Biscayan. I know that there are reasons, but since this brings me so much suffering none of them suffices. 1. Jesus be with your honor. Whether here or there, God gives us all trials; may he be ever blessed. You ought not grieve over the departure of Don Gonzalo with Lorencico, for my brother will not give his consent nor does he think it opportune. I did not write to him because the servant lad had left by the time they gave me the letter. Now I am praying for both boys.
2. You should know that our trials of every kind at this time have reached a peak, for we have received a counter-brief and now must all remain subject to the nuncio. It doesn't distress me very much, for it seems perhaps to be a better path toward our becoming a province; and we will not have to see Padre Gracián among those people.
3. I am in such a hurry that I don't even know how I am managing to write this, for I am sending some counsels to those houses there. I",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,0,16,1,9,23,2,3,3,13,9,8,11,13,4,0,0,1,1,0,1
"881",1578,50,"only ask that they pray for me. I am my usual self, for trials are health and medicine for me.
4. Many greetings to Señor Juan de Ovalle and to Doña Beatriz; the nuns here send their greetings to you. My brothers are well. They still don't know that Pedro is going there.
It is August 8, and I am yours,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your paternity, mi padre. Yesterday I wrote to you by way of Mancera and I sent the letter to the subprior asking him to inquire whether you are in Peñaranda, as you wrote that you would be, and not to let anyone know, even if he be a friar, but to keep the matter to himself. And I included two letters from Roque in which he insists very much that you go immediately to Madrid. Even though he says he is writing to you, I fear that his letters will be intercepted, and so I am writing you myself about what is taking place. If by chance you did not go where you told me you were going, I am sending another messenger to Valladolid and informing Mother Prioress about how she should respond. Roque is very insistent that nothing different be said, for that would be our ruin. He sent me in writing what was sent to her. I have informed the other monasteries. Please God, there will be no need for this, for it is sad to see these souls entrusted to someone who doesn't understand them.
2. Nonetheless, the only thing that worries and distresses me is what concerns my Paul. If only I could see him free. Certainly, I don't know why, but even were I to want to feel disturbed about the rest of things, I could not. The Lord will provide. I would be happy if you stayed up here and didn't go down there. But I am very afraid, for even in your going back and forth to say Mass you cannot avoid danger.
3. I am afraid of how things are going and wish you were gone from there and in a safe place. And let me know where you are, for goodness' sake, so that I don't carry on like a dunce on the day I have to inform you about something, as I am now doing with your code words, which you changed without letting me know the meaning. I deeply wish you would travel with a companion, even if he be a lay brother.

"882",1578,51,"Yesterday the prior of Santo Tomás was here. He doesn't think it a bad idea that before going to Madrid you wait for the answer from Joannes to see how everything went, and the rector agrees and so does my brother. I told them that you had written to Joannes. Since the briefs are delivered to the president, I don't see any reason to hurry. There are only two reasons that prompt me to want you to go: First, a great fear that they will take you captive here, and if that were the case (God deliver you!), it would be better for you to go. Second, it would be good to know what the nuncio intends to do with you before you go to see the king. Nonetheless, it would be fitting that your meeting with the nuncio take place in the presence of the president.
5. I wrote this to you in a letter yesterday. There you will see that I believe the Lord will give you light for this since he gives you peace with which to bear it, as I saw from your talks with him. What is happening is that last Sunday, which was the third of this month, Padre Mariano was notified by a brief, which, as I understand, was the same as the one they brought there, although Roque didn't explain much. He only says that it is very wordy and revokes what the previous nuncio did. It must be the same brief you mention, but they don't understand it. And he says it is from the pope, but it must be only from the nuncio because in his reply Padre Mariano says he will obey the orders of the nuncio. Roque says they told him in it not to consider you his superior and to obey no one but the nuncio.
6. I'm delighted about this, and perhaps he will not give as free a hand to these wolves as they think and after all will want to please the king. I don't hesitate to believe what you say about their seeking to put an end to the reforms, and nothing would make me happier than to see you freed from the task, for after that everything will turn out well.
7. Here they haven't notified us of anything, nor have they in Mancera because the provincial hasn't left Avila. They must have to wait for something. Roque says that all monasteries must be notified of the brief and he doesn't say whether",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,4,0,3,12,2,0,0,13,11,11,6,8,6,7,1,1,0,0,0
"883",1578,52,"this includes those of the friars or not. I already wrote to the prioress in Alba to accept that sister and to Teresa de Layz to give her approval. I am so consoled that God favors you with moments of happiness in the midst of so many trials that I don't know how I could feel sad.
8. I was at this point when the Reverend Padre Rioja arrived at the door with a notary to give notification of the brief. They didn't call me but Mother Prioress. From what I understand of the brief it is the same as the one they must have brought there, for they say it is now under consideration by the royal council. God forgive me, for I am still unable to believe that the nuncio ordered such a thing, I mean in that style. Had you not followed the counsel of so many learned men, I would not be surprised that you were very distressed. But since you proceeded so justly in everything and since you waited almost a year without making any visitations until you knew that the nuncio stated that the faculties had not been revoked, I don't know how one can speak like this. In a certain way, although this distresses me very much, I am inspired with devotion since I know with what prudence you proceeded in the midst of so much wickedness. I tell you, mi padre, God loves you very much and that you are advancing well in imitation of him. I am very happy because God gives you what you ask for, which are trials, and God will come to your defense since he is just. May he be blessed for everything.
9. All the learned men here say that even though the nuncio gives you orders you are not obliged to obey since he does not show the patent letters that support his authority. Oh, what precious treasures these trials are, mi padre! They cannot be bought for any price because through them such a great crown is won. When I recall that our Lord himself and all his saints walked this path, all I can do is envy you, for now I don't deserve suffering, unless it is to feel what one whom I truly love suffers, which is a much greater trial.
10. Tomorrow we will work out an agreement on how Padre Julián de Avila will go to Madrid to show the nuncio our recognition of him as superior and win his favor",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,1,2,8,0,8,24,2,3,3,16,12,3,5,8,0,3,2,0,0,2,0
"884",1578,53,"so as to beseech him not to place us under the jurisdiction of the calced friars. I in turn will write to some persons to get them to try to placate him in your regard and explain how you didn't make any moves until you learned what he said and that you would be ever eager to obey him if it were not for the certitude that Tostado is out to destroy us. Certainly I can sincerely express satisfaction because in exchange for not being subject to the friars of the cloth, everything seems acceptable to me.
11. Julián will ask him for the permissions necessary for these monasteries, such as permission for workmen to enter inside, and things of that sort, for I've been told that as soon as obedience is rendered to him, he immediately becomes our superior.
12. May the Lord grant us his favor, for they cannot oblige us to offend him. The saintly Paul remains at home with me and no one can take away what I promised this saint.
13. The sisters here have regretted the brief most of all because of what it says about you, and they send their best regards and are praying hard for you. There is nothing to fear, mi padre, but praise God that he leads us by the path he followed. May His Majesty keep you for me and be pleased to grant that I may see you free of these conflicts.
Today is the vigil of St. Lawrence.
Your unworthy servant and true daughter,
Teresa of Jesus To the very magnificent Señor Roque de Huerta, chief forest guard of his majesty.
I think this is the day he must speak to the king, for he arrived at the Escorial yesterday. Watch carefully that if he is placed under the authority of the nuncio his safety will be guaranteed. For I see that many things are being done that have no legal backing. It's necessary to insist on the matter of our becoming a province ... brother, I beg you to place the enclosed in his very hands. For our Father Visitator, Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios; hand deliver.
1. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. If you had not passed through here, I would have merited little from these trials, because they caused me almost no suffering, but afterward I paid for everything at once. I tell you I was so moved to see you that all day yesterday, Wednesday, my heart",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,3,10,0,5,19,1,2,2,7,9,7,13,11,4,3,3,3,0,0,0
"885",1578,54,"was in anguish not knowing what to do at seeing you so afflicted, and rightly so, on being in such danger in everything and constrained to go about in hiding like a criminal. But my trust in a good outcome does not leave me for a moment. The fact is, mi padre, that God has found a good means for me to suffer in desiring that the blows strike where they hurt me most.
2. Today, the vigil of our Lady, the good Roque sent me a copy of the ordinance, which consoled us greatly. Since the king takes the position he does, you will be free of danger, which is what was tormenting all of us nuns. As for all the rest, I see much courage in these sisters. The Lord has willed that my pain not last long, and it was lucky that you left when you did and went by way of the Escorial.
3. By means of this messenger, whose name is Pedro, you can tell me what happened and what is happening in every respect. Let Valladolid know, for they are disturbed. They sent a messenger once they learned what happened to Padre Fray Juan de Jesús.
4. Moreover, don't forget to see if you can do anything for Fray John of the Cross and to let me know if it would be opportune for us to send someone to the nuncio so that he witness a certain obedience on the part of the discalced Carmelites, since we have in fact given him our obedience. We will also look into these matters here and do what seems best in the event that you are not there. After we have obeyed, doing this will not be harmful to the justice of our cause. Today I received letters from Valladolid and Medina. They have not received any notification. These brothers of mine must have known what was happening here, for I don't believe they were just being lazy.
5. Mi padre, I am very worried that in this ordinance and in all this turmoil no visitator is named other than mi padre Gracián. I would not want anything to come from Rome against him. So it seems to me you ought to recall the light that Paul saw -- for it seems it was confirmed by what Angela saw -- and withdraw as much as you can from this fire, as long as you don't anger the king, and no matter what Padre Mariano tells you. Your conscience is",3,2,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,0,12,13,4,3,2,13,7,8,11,9,6,0,1,0,1,0,0
"886",1578,55,"not of the kind that can adapt to contrary opinions. In fact even when there is nothing to fear you go about in torment, as has happened these past days; and everyone will approve of what you do. Let them manage their own battles.
6. Once everything is very settled and secure, you will be doing a great deal by exposing yourself to danger without having scruples to add to it. I tell you certainly that the greatest distress I have felt in this turmoil is the fear, hidden I don't know where in me, that you will not be freed of your charge as visitator. If the Lord wills this, he will watch over you as he has up to now, but I will not be free of torment.
7. For you to withdraw as I have mentioned, your sound judgment will be necessary so that you don't appear to be afraid of anything other than offending God, and that is true. And if you should speak with the nuncio, defend your position if he is willing to listen and explain that you will be always happy to obey him, and that you accepted that charge because you knew that Tostado wanted to cut short the reform that has been started and that he could inquire about how we are living and things of that sort. Take advantage of every opportunity to speak about our becoming a separate province and the required conditions. For everything depends on this, and the reform as well.
8. You must speak with the king, the president, the archbishop and all explaining to them the scandals and battles that arise when this is not done, especially with these friars in Castile. Since they have no visitator or means for safeguarding justice, they do whatever they want. You will know how to say it better, for it's foolish of me to be putting this down here, but all your other cares might cause you to forget. I don't know if Pedro  will be the one bringing this, for he can't find a mule. In any event the messenger will be a safe one. Keep me informed about everything, for goodness' sake, even though you have little time, and tell me how Padre Mariano is.
9. The sisters here entrust themselves very much to your prayers. Were you to know how concerned they are about you in your sufferings, you would be pleased, and their praise is all for you, mi padre. I regret that we sent",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,1,4,0,12,18,5,5,1,14,9,11,11,13,1,6,1,0,1,0,0
"887",1578,56,"a messenger to the sisters in Beas and Caravaca. They must be distressed, and they will not be able to know anything further for a while, even though our letters were filled with hope, except for what referred to your suffering so that they would pray harder to God for you. If there is someone in those parts who can inform them, tell Roque, for charity's sake. Yesterday I sent him 50 ducats and today the remainder of the 1,000 reales. I am very sorry you have to remain there in this heat and go hungry. Since it will take a long time for these affairs to be settled, it might be good if you came to Mancera. Consider this, out of charity, for we would be closer.
10. Let me know what has happened with those from Pastrana who were imprisoned. Oh, if your visit to me could be repeated so as to repair the torment caused by the previous one. May God bring this to pass and grant me the favor of seeing you in a situation in which I don't have to go about with so many fears, amen.
It is the feast of the vigil of our Lady of August. After all, on her feast days trials and consolations come as her gifts.
Your paternity's unworthy subject and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus You will not believe, daughter, the pain I suffer because of the disappearance of mi padre Fray John of the Cross. We find no trace of him and have no light as to his whereabouts. These calced fathers are making every effort to put an end to this reform. For the love of God I beg you, since you and my daughter Catalina de Jesús commune so familiarly with our good Jesus, to beg him to favor and help us. For this intention recite the litany in choir for fifteen days. And during these days, in addition to the hours of prayer you have, add another hour. And inform me, daughter, of how you are implementing this. For mi padre, Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios, hand deliver.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. We greatly rejoiced over the letter that Pedro brought filled with hopeful news of good things which, it seems, will not fail to be realized. May our Lord provide in the way by which he will be best served. Nonetheless, until I know that Paul has spoken to Methuselah and how the",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,12,0,7,13,2,0,3,11,8,9,11,3,1,2,2,1,1,1,1
"888",1578,57,"meeting went I will not be without worry. For goodness' sake when you get news of it, write to me.
2. I felt very sorry about the death of so Catholic a king as was the King of Portugal and angry with those who allowed him to get into such danger. Everywhere we turn the world lets us know that we cannot be sure of any happiness unless we seek it in suffering.
3. In every possible way or, if you will, under whatever conditions strive that we be made a separate province. Even though other trials will not be lacking, it will mean a lot to have security. If, then, those of the cloth also urge the nuncio in this regard -- for I think they would willingly do so -- it would be wonderful. I would not like it if you stopped trying, for if the nuncio sees that no one is opposed he will do so willingly.
4. We were very amused by his response to the calced friars on the action they were to undertake in Medina and on how they might persuade the nuns to obey the provincial of those of the cloth. Valdemoro is there as vicar, for he didn't have a sufficient number of votes to be prior. The provincial left him there as vicar that he might find a solution for the problems in that house. After what happened some time ago, he is on bad terms with Alberta, the prioress. The calced friars go about saying that the nuns owe them obedience and many other things. The nuns are dying from fear of him. I have reassured them.
5. As soon as you think that it would be good on our part to manifest some courteous submission to the nuncio, let us know; and tell us quickly, for goodness' sake, how your meeting with him went. I will be worried until I know, although I have hope in the Lord that so many prayers will bear fruit and that all will go well. I am delighted that you have such good lodging. You needed all this after having suffered such trials. I would like it if you went with the Count of Tendilla the first time you went to see the nuncio. If the nuncio wishes to excuse you, you will be fully clear of blame for all you were accused of.
6. I tell you I am certain that if some influential person were to ask the nuncio to have Fray John set",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,6,2,12,16,3,3,2,9,8,17,17,7,2,1,1,0,1,0,1
"889",1578,58,"free, he would at once give orders that he be returned to his house. It would be enough to tell the nuncio about this father and how he is kept in prison unjustly. I don't know what is happening that no one ever remembers this saint. If Mariano were to speak to the Princess of Eboli, she would intercede with the nuncio.
7. The fathers of the Society are in a great hurry for Padre Mariano to come, for they are in serious need. If he would not be greatly missed there, I beg you out of charity to arrange that he come. It is a long time that they have been asking for this. Now they are sending a letter to the nuncio so that he might give his authorization. Including the trip here and back, it will take Mariano only five or six days in all. He will only have to stay here for a day or half a day. Do not let all your other business cause you to forget this. Consider how opportune the time is to entrust you with this charge, for though it may seem to be of little importance, it is considered most important here.
8. I don't know how we can repay Don Diego for all we owe him. Payment for so much charity has to come from above. Give him my best regards and tell him I beg him not to leave you until you are safe, for I am frightened by all these deaths that are happening to travelers on their journeys. May God in his divine goodness keep you from danger. I ask Señora Juana
 for prayers; give my regards to the secretary and those ladies. Great is my desire that we will no longer be the cause of so many trials for them.
9. You should know that our Father General wrote a letter to Doña Quiteria as you will see from the enclosed letter. May God forgive the one who informed him so badly. If His Majesty should grant us the favor of being made a separate province, we must then send someone to Rome at once, for I believe we will become his most cherished subjects. Let us be so for His Majesty, and let whatever happens happen. And may he watch over you, amen.
10. They are ringing for Matins, so I'll say no more except that the prioress and sisters are well and feel very calm and ask for your prayers, as does my brother. All",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,6,7,1,4,17,1,1,1,12,6,12,14,7,2,3,1,0,0,0,0
"890",1578,59,"of them are most content with the way our affairs are going. My great joy is that the end of those miserable visitations is in sight and that you will not have to be involved in them, which costs me so dearly. Although I desire so much that you be free of having to make visitations, I fear that so great a blessing will not last long.
Today is August 19.
Your unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
God reward you for the image you sent as a gift. To the very magnificent Señor Roque de Huerta, chief forest guard of his majesty.
1. ... Don't worry about anything; the Lord will provide when you least expect. My worry now, the greatest I've had, is whether our padre has fallen into the nuncio's hands. I would much rather see him in the hands of God and amid the dangers of travel to Rome, even if worse, and among those friars chosen to go. Perhaps I don't know what I am talking about.
2. For goodness' sake let me know what is happening as soon as possible, for we are all troubled over this. And how is Padre Fray Antonio, for I have been very distressed in his regard. Those were heavy blows to take by one who was so ill and weak. He is a saint, and God is treating him as one.
3. Great was the consolation I derived from the count's letter, for it seems to me God has chosen him as a means to help us. I am answering with the enclosed letter. It is a most important letter, and I wouldn't want any mishap to come to it. If his lordship is there, you can give it to him yourself. Otherwise, send it to him through a private messenger. And note how important it is, for it not to be lost.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus To my very reverend padre in Christ, Fray Antonio de Segura, guardian of the house of Cadalso. To be delivered at the aforementioned house.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with you mi padre. I don't know how to put in words what little attention we should pay to the things of this world and how little I understand it. I say this because I never thought you would so forget Teresa of Jesus, and since you are so close this couldn't be due to a poor memory. It's hard to believe that you were here and neglected to visit this house, which is",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,4,15,0,11,13,5,1,3,11,7,11,11,2,3,1,4,2,2,0,0
"891",1578,60,"yours, and give it your blessing.
2. Now Padre Julián has written me that you are the guardian there in Cadalso. However weak your memory, you could inquire about me now and then. May it please the Lord that you not so forget me in your prayers, for if you remember me in your prayers I will endure the rest; miserable though I am, I do not forget you in mine.
3. He also wrote me that my nephew is coming here, although just in passing. If he has not gone yet, I beg you to have him write to me at length about how he is doing interiorly and exteriorly, for in the measure that he practices obedience along the way, he will be either very proficient or distracted. May God strengthen him, for they are not dealing with him as I thought they would, his being a relative of mine. If it's necessary for me to get his superiors to look kindly toward him, please let me know. For with friends like Señora Doña María de Mendoza and others similar to her, it will be easy to get them to consider allowing him to have a little respite.
4. If you should be passing by, be sure that you do not fail to visit this house, which is yours. May the Lord guide us on the path to heaven. I am well, and we are doing well, glory to God. Since I don't know whether or not Fray Juan de Jesús is there, I am not writing to him. May God give him interior strength, which he will surely need, and may the Lord also be with you.
Your reverence's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
5. Our Padre Fray Bartolomé de Santa Ana will be spending all of this Lent with Doña Luisa in Paracuellos. 1. ... I tell you that ever present to me is what they did with Fray John of the Cross, for I don't know how God bears with things like that; even you don't know everything about it. For all these nine months he was held in a little prison cell where small as he is he could hardly fit. In all that time he was given no change of tunic, even though he had come close to the point of death. Only three days before his escape the subprior gave him one of his shirts. He underwent harsh scourges, and no one was allowed to see him.
2. I experience the greatest envy. Surely",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,12,1,5,18,2,1,2,9,7,9,12,9,2,0,0,1,1,0,0
"892",1578,61,"our Lord found in him the resources for such a martyrdom. And it is good that this be known so that everyone will be all the more on guard against these people. May God forgive them, amen.
3. An investigation should be conducted to show the nuncio what those friars did to this saint, Fray John, without any fault on his part, for it is a pitiful thing. Tell this to Fray Germán; he will do it because he's quite mad about this ... 1. When the previous nuncio died we thought for sure that the visitation had ended. The theologians and law scholars from Alcalá and Madrid, and some from Toledo, with whom we discussed this case said that it had not because the visitation had already been started. They said that although the nuncio died the visitation did not end but had to be completed. They held that if it hadn't commenced then it would have ended with the death of the one giving the faculties. And the president, Covarrubias, said again that because the visitation hadn't ended it should not be stopped. All were in agreement with this.
2. Afterward, when this nuncio arrived he told Gracián to bring him his faculties and the processes. Gracián was wanting to give the whole thing up, but he was advised that the king would be displeased, because he was also under the king's command. He went to the archbishop and told him what was happening. The archbishop scolded him and told him he had the courage of a fly and that he should go and give an account of everything to the king. And when Padre Gracián explained, for love of the nuncio, the disadvantages that could arise, the archbishop replied that anyone can have recourse to a higher authority, and he made him go to speak to the king. The king ordered him to go to his monastery and said that he would inquire into the matter.
3. Some learned men and even the presentado Romero, whom I asked about this here, said that since the nuncio had not shown his faculties for issuing orders in this case, Padre Gracián was not obliged to stop, and they gave many other reasons for this. He had not shown the faculties previously or up to now (unless he has done so within the past ten days). I know definitely that the king would require that he show them.
4. Despite all these opinions Padre Gracián remained nine months -- more or less",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,10,2,0,2,6,3,4,13,0,1,2,9,7,10,9,8,0,6,0,0,0,1,0
"893",1578,62,"-- without using his faculties, not even for a signature, even though he knew what the nuncio said and swore that the nuncio had never forbade him to carry on the visitation. And there are many witnesses to this and also to the nuncio's answer to a friar who asked that he remove Gracián, which was that he had no authority to do so.
5. After these months the present president sent for Padre Gracián to order him to resume the visitation. Gracián ardently begged him not to give him such a command. The president responded that this was impossible because it was the will of God and of the king, and that he himself didn't want the office that he held either. And he said other things of this sort. Padre Gracián asked whether he should go to see the nuncio. He said no but that if anything was needed he should have recourse to him. The council furnished him with many writs so that everywhere he could call for help from the secular arm.
6. It had always been thought through what was heard from the nuncio that he did not have authority over religious orders. For since the king was displeased with what he had done so quickly in Gracián's regard without reporting to him, the nuncio didn't do anything. Now we think he has received some superior order from the pope to act the way he does, not that he has shown it to the council or to anyone as far as is known.
7. Padre Gracián became very troubled, for if he paid heed to the nuncio and did not do what the king ordered, we would be lost, without the king's favor, for it is the king who supports and intercedes for us with the pope. This is especially so since it is definitely known that the nuncio was seeking to have Tostado do the visitation, for he was the vicar sent by the general and one of those of the cloth. And we know for certain that Tostado was determined to close down all our houses, in accord with the decision of the general chapter, that only two or three be left of them all, that no more friars be accepted among them, and that they dress no differently from other Carmelites. Only so as to support us did Padre Gracián accept the task of visitator, much to his own affliction.
8. He also found it hard to have to present documentation relative to the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,1,1,4,0,2,16,0,0,1,13,4,9,9,6,1,4,1,1,0,0,0
"894",1578,63,"faults of the friars of the cloth in Andalusia, for much was told to him in secret. By doing so he would disturb everyone and defame many while not knowing whether the nuncio had the powers to carry out such reforms, for the nuncio had never shown proof of his authority.
9. This is the whole truth, and there are other things as well, which anyone who knew them would see clearly how unjust is the treatment Gracián receives in that brief. He has done nothing without the opinion of good men of learning, for even though he is a learned man himself, he never proceeds on his own. Not showing one's faculties is something new in Spain, for nuncios always show them.
10. See if it would not be good that this information copied in good handwriting be sent to Madrid and given to certain persons.
Teresa of Jesus This is the authorization for Sister María de Jesús to make her profession. I grant it with great pleasure. May the blessing of the Lord de rore coeli et de pinguedine terrae be granted her. For love of our Lord I beg you, daughter, to suffer and be silent and not try to send that padre away from there, no matter how many trials and troubles he causes, unless something amounts to an offense against God. I cannot bear our seeming to be ungrateful to someone who has helped us. For I remember that when others wanted to deceive us about a house they were selling, he alerted us to their deceit. I can never forget the good he did us in that instance and the trouble he saved us from. And he has always seemed to me to be a servant of God and well intentioned. I see clearly that this need in me to show gratitude is not a sign of perfection. It must be a natural trait, for I could be bribed with a sardine. 1. Jesus be with your honors. I received your letter. It always makes me very happy to have news from you and to see how our Lord keeps you faithful to your good resolves. That is no small thing with your being in that Babylon, where you will always hear things more apt to distract the soul than to recollect it. It's true, though, that for those with good intelligence the sight of so much going on, and such a variety, will lead them to recognize the vanity and short duration of all",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,1,1,10,0,9,23,2,1,1,12,8,8,9,16,5,2,0,0,0,1,0
"895",1578,64,"things.
2. The events that have been going on in our order for more than a year are of a kind that would cause much grief to anyone who does not understand our Lord's designs. But in seeing that everything is for the greater purification of souls and that in the end God will favor his servants, we have no reason to grieve, but should long for the trials to increase and praise God that he has granted us the favor of suffering for justice' sake. And you both should do the same and trust in him, for when you least expect it you will see your desires fulfilled.
May His Majesty shield you with the holiness I beg of him, amen ... For mi padre, Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios. 
1. ... all this would be most important, or at least to send one, but it would be better for two to go. Both are good friends of the Jesuits, which would be no small help in the negotiations. In any case, for goodness' sake, write to us at once and don't keep us waiting any longer. Everyone is amazed that we don't have anyone in Rome to carry on our business for us, and so those others do whatever they want. The two chosen to go ought to bring a record of the request made by the discalced friars to have their own protector.
2. The moment has come for us to move quickly; there is little time, as you see. You can inform me from there if it is already too late, for however much we want to hurry, it seems a month will be needed. I laugh to think that I am speaking as though everything is ready, those who are to go and the means necessary for such a trip. But if we don't begin, nothing will get done. We should have started when we obeyed the brief.
3. Fray Antonio is complaining terribly that we did not say anything to him, and he is right. I am surprised at Roque, since there are so many messengers between Madrid and Granada. I told Fray Antonio that you should have informed him and that he had been able to use his powers without scruple as long as nothing was known. I don't know where the letter ended up. If I find it I will send it to you. I tell you I felt sad that you have discalced friars like that with so little",1,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,7,2,6,15,0,0,4,11,6,17,12,4,3,2,1,0,0,0,0
"896",1578,65,"loyalty. I am referring to the one who went off with Fray Baltasar. The calced jailers treated you better. Please God he won't try anything else when he is free; as for the rest, it's better that he is out.
4. I'm afraid those of the cloth have taken Fray Juan de la Miseria prisoner, for ever since they say they last saw him, he has not been seen. May the Lord provide a remedy for everything and guard you for us, as I and these daughters of yours beg of him, amen.
5. My health is fair. The prioress of Salamanca has written me that she wrote informing you she has already received the nun.
Today is the feast of St. Michael.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
6. Tell Padre Mariano what you think you should from this. Give my regards to him and to Fray Bartolomé. And answer me soon about Rome. You ought to know that there is someone in Madrid from the Society who is a good friend of mine. They say that he is there by order of the president. It could be that they are from the same region. If it would be helpful, I will write to him. His name is Pablo Hernández.
7. This letter was entrusted to a carrier who got sick, and it was returned to me. I opened it to see what I said and it seems to me that you should see it, even if it might tire you. It grieved me deeply to learn of what Fray John had to suffer and that they are allowing him, as sick as he is, to go down there right away. Please God he doesn't die on us. Be sure, as a favor to me, that they take good care of him in Almodóvar and that he doesn't go any further. Don't fail to give the necessary orders. And be careful not to forget. I tell you that you would have few like him left, if he were to die. 1. ... May God give you fortitude so that you remain steadfast in righteousness, even if you find yourself surrounded by great danger. Blessed are trials when, however heavy, they do not make one turn aside in the least from righteousness. I am not surprised that anyone who loves you wants to see you free of those dangers and looks for means toward this, although it would not be a good thing to abandon the Blessed Virgin in times of such",1,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,9,3,8,22,2,2,5,9,3,12,12,4,6,3,1,0,4,2,0
"897",1578,66,"great need. Certainly, Señora Juana would not give you such advice, nor would she consent to such a change. God deliver us. Nor by doing so would you be escaping trials but walking right into them. For these trials of ours with God's help will soon pass, but those of another order could perhaps go on for the rest of your life. You ought to consider this.
2. The more I think about your faculties as visitator being restored the worse it seems to me. Every day I would have to live with the shock of seeing you in a thousand battles of a thousand kinds. And, after all, I see that the honor of your being a visitator will not last any longer than a mouthful of bread, while our torment at seeing you in such danger could last always. For the love of God I beg you to refuse even if the nuncio himself orders it. To the very magnificent and reverend señor and padre mio Doctor Pablo Hernández of the Society of Jesus, my lord, in Madrid; hand deliver.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, padre mío. Eight days ago I received a letter from the prioress in Toledo, Ana de los Angeles, in which she tells me that you are in Madrid. It gave me great consolation since I think God brought you there to give me some relief from my trials. I tell you they are so many -- having started a year ago last August -- and of such variety that it would bring me much relief if I could see you and find rest in recounting some of them to you. It would be impossible to tell you about all of them. To top everything off we are now in the situation that the one who delivers this letter will tell you about. He is a person who loves us much and shares in our distress and is someone we can trust.
2. The devil cannot bear the genuine way in which these discalced friars and nuns serve our Lord. I tell you, you would be consoled to witness the perfection of their life. There are now nine houses of discalced friars and many good subjects in them. Since they have not been joined into a separate province, the disturbances and trials they undergo from those of the cloth are so many as to be indescribable.
3. Now all of our fortune or misfortune, after God, lies in the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,13,0,8,15,2,3,0,5,3,15,10,8,4,0,1,2,3,2,1
"898",1578,67,"hands of the nuncio, and, for our sins, those of the cloth have so informed him -- and he gives them so much credit -- that I don't know where it will end up. Of me they say that I am a restless vagabond and that the monasteries I have founded were established without permission from the pope or general. Think of it, what could be more wicked or could there be any worse kind of Christian behavior.
4. Many other things, unrepeatable, do those blessed friars say about me. And as for Padre Maestro Gracián, who was their visitator, it is a pity, the shameful assertions they make against him. I can testify to you that he is one of the greatest servants of God with whom I have dealt and of surpassing honesty and purity of conscience. Believe me I am speaking the truth. After all, he was brought up by the Jesuits in Alcalá as you may know.
5. All this comes from the fact that the nuncio is very mad at him for certain reasons for which, if the nuncio would listen to him, he would find that he deserves little or no blame. And the nuncio is also mad at me, without my having done anything contrary to his service. Indeed, I have most willingly obeyed a brief he sent here and written him as humble a letter as I could.
6. I think it all comes from above, that the Lord wills that we suffer and that there be no one to side with the truth and put in a good word for me. Truly I tell you that I don't feel troubled or distressed over what concerns me personally, rather I feel a special joy. But it seems to me that if it were ascertained that what those fathers are saying about me is not true, then perhaps what they say about Padre Maestro Gracián will not be believed, which is what is most important to us. So I am sending you a copy of the patent letters that authorize our foundations because the nuncio says we are in bad standing for having founded houses without permission. I think the devil is making every effort to discredit these houses. And so I would like there to be servants of God who would defend them. Oh, mi padre, how few are one's friends in time of need.
7. They tell me that the president regards you very highly, that you are in Madrid for his sake.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,1,10,0,14,16,3,4,2,13,9,11,13,11,0,7,3,1,0,0,0
"899",1578,68,"I think he has been informed of all this, and more, by the nuncio. It would be most helpful to us if you could undeceive him, for as an eyewitness, knowing my soul, you can. I believe you will be rendering our Lord a great service. And tell him how important it is to go forward with what was begun for this holy order, for you know how fallen it was.
8. They say that it is a new order with many novelties. Let them read our first rule, for we are doing no more than observe it without mitigation, with the rigor at first given to it by the pope. And let them believe only what they see, and learn about how we live and how the calced friars live and not listen to them. I don't know where they get so many things that are not so, and with these they wage war against us.
9. And I also beg you to speak for me to the nuncio's confessor and give him my regards and inform him about the whole truth so as to oblige him in conscience not to publish things so injurious without first investigating, and tell him that despite my being so wretched, I wouldn't dare do what they are saying. Do this if you think it would be appropriate, otherwise, no.
10. If it seems right to you, you could show him the patent letters, the authority on which I have founded monasteries. One of the letters includes a command that I not stop making foundations. And in one letter our Father General wrote me, after I asked him not to order me to make any more foundations, that he would like me to found as many monasteries as I have hairs on my head. It is not right that so many nuns who are servants of God be discredited through false declarations. Since I have been reared in and given being, as they say, by the Society, I think it would be right to make known the truth so that a person as important as the nuncio (since he comes to reform religious orders -- and he is not from this country) be enlightened about who needs reforming and who needs to be favored. And he should punish the one who goes to him with so many lies. You will see what must be done.
11. What I beg of you for love of our Lord and his precious Mother is that since you have",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,2,0,2,11,1,3,10,0,3,0,16,13,14,6,4,3,5,1,3,1,1,0
"900",1578,69,"favored us from the time you came to know us that you do so in our present need and defend the truth in the way you think most suitable. Our friars will repay you very well -- and you owe it to my affection for you. And I beg you to keep me informed about everything and mainly about your health. Mine has been very poor, for the Lord has tried me in every way this year. But what regards myself wouldn't pain me much if it were not for the suffering I experience at seeing that on account of my sins these servants of God are suffering. May His Majesty be with you and watch over you. Let me know if you will be residing for long in Madrid, for I've been told you will.
Today is the feast of St. Francis.
Your honor's unworthy and true servant.
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. For some days your daughters -- and our sisters -- have been wanting to receive the holy habit of our Lady. Knowing that you have not been opposed to this, I decided to give it to them today, after observing the spirit and fervor with which they were asking me for it. I think this will be for the glory of God.
2. I beg you, out of charity, to accept this and to consider the favor His Majesty has shown you in giving you daughters he has chosen to be his brides. They are very consoled. Their only concern is for the sorrow this might have caused the both of you. For love of our Lord, may they not sense anything that could cause unrest to their souls so well prepared for this state. You will have them here -- something perhaps better than if they were elsewhere -- for your consolation, and you can consider all the nuns of this house to be your servants and capellanas.
May our Lord be always with your soul, and may he guide you, amen.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite To the very magnificent Señor Roque de Huerta, chief forest guard of His Majesty, Madrid.
1. ... with brevity, and send it to me through a trustworthy person, and pay a good portage. I hope in God the outcome will be good, for I don't see in our fathers there the capability of finding a better solution. May God help us with something from that inheritance -- for there will be",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,6,19,0,5,22,0,0,3,13,4,8,19,7,3,0,0,0,2,1,0

2. For your assurance I am sending you copies of the authorized patent letters, and I am writing to a father from the Society, who is a good friend of mine and my confessor -- I don't know what office he now holds. He is very good and a close acquaintance of the president's. I ask you to inform him of what I am being silent about, and I am begging you to do so, and tell him of the scandals caused by these fathers and how they held that saint, Fray John of the Cross, for nine months. For you still may not know of what he suffered and the accusations they are making. If the president should want to see the patent letters, give them to him, so that once he has seen them, you may show them to whomever you think should see them. Perhaps he will show them to the president or to the nuncio's confessor. I am also sending the latter a message. Take him aside and speak to him privately.
3. I would like it if some of the lies they tell were investigated so that what involves our padre would not be believed. Consider how beneficial this could prove; don't think it would be a waste of time. Tell him about the nuncio's attitude toward us and how those others have deceived him. Let us do our part, and God will then do what he wills. This is God's cause, and all will end well. My hope is in him; do not be distressed.
4. Let me know where those fathers went. Since I do not think they are there I am not writing to them. If by chance our padre is in Almodóvar, send him these letters by special courier if there is no other trustworthy way, but I don't think he will be there.
5. God be with you. My head can do no more for now. I kiss the hands of those gentlemen many times.
6. You should know that when our general tells me to found as many monasteries as I have hairs on my head, he does so not in a patent letter but",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,3,7,0,3,13,1,1,1,16,8,15,12,5,3,2,2,4,0,1,0

It is 4 October.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
7. I was happy to learn of the arrival of Don Alonso and the other news. Please God we will receive a full report.
Be careful not to speak of the matter concerning Rome except with our padre -- even though the other be a friar -- and do whatever could be of benefit. There is no basis to what was said about Fray Juan de Jesús going there. 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, mi padre. Because I see you freed from that turmoil, my distress has left me. As for the rest, let whatever comes come. I greatly grieved over the news written to me about our Father General. I feel deep sorrow, and the first day cried and cried without being able to do otherwise. I so regret the trials we caused him, for certainly he didn't deserve them, and if we could have gone to see him, everything would have proceeded smoothly. May God forgive the one who always prevented this, for with you I could have reached an agreement even though in this matter you did not trust my opinion very much. The Lord will bring everything to a good end. But I feel sorry about all this and about what you suffered, for certainly what you wrote to me about in your first letter -- I received two after you spoke with the nuncio -- was like the drink of death.
2. You should know, mi padre, that I was being consumed with anxiety because you were not handing over those documents at once, but probably receiving counsel from someone who feels little grief over what you suffer. I am delighted that now through experience you know how to conduct the business matters along the right path and are not struggling against the current, as I was always pointing out. Indeed, there were certain things that created obstacles everywhere, and so there is no need to talk about this, for God ordains things so that his servants suffer.
3. I wanted to write more at length, but they are coming to collect the letters tonight -- and it is already almost night. I first wrote to the Bishop of Osma to get him to speak with the president and with Padre Mariano about the matter of which I wrote to you. I asked him to keep you informed. Just",1,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,10,3,14,16,4,0,9,8,6,10,8,9,2,4,4,0,0,0,1
"903",1578,72,"now I was with my brother, and he sends you his best regards.
4. We are all in agreement here that the friars should not go to Rome -- especially after the death of our Father General -- for these reasons: First, because this plan is not secret, and before they depart, they might be taken captive by the calced friars, which would expose them to death. Second, they would lose their documents and money. Third, they don't have much experience with doing business in Rome. Fourth, on their arrival there, in the absence of Father General, they could be taken for fugitives, for they would end up wandering through the streets without any help, as I am insisting with Padre Mariano. If here with all the favor we enjoy we could not rescue Fray John, what will happen there? Everyone here thinks it would be bad to send friars, especially my brother who is very pained by the way our friars are being treated. It seems to us here that someone should be chosen as our representative to go and press our cause and carry on our business. My brother, especially, thinks this, for he knows the calced friars. He says that this is very important and that everything should be directed to the person about whom I wrote to you. Doctor Rueda has so much trust in him that he doesn't think it is necessary to send any religious.
5. Consider all of this carefully, and if you and Padre Mariano agree with it, send a messenger to Almodóvar and have them cancel the trip of the two friars to Rome, and inform me as soon as possible about what you decide. The one who would go from here is very experienced, although that means that it would cost us more. If for the moment we provide the cost, afterward each house would contribute to it. We could borrow from the Alcalá inheritance and then pay it back, for I certainly don't know how we could get a quick loan here. I am writing about this to Padre Mariano as you will see.
6. Keep well, mi padre, for God will bring everything to a good end. May he be pleased that finally we will all be in agreement and do nothing that would allow the friars to turn us into martyrs.
May God keep you, amen.
Your paternity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
7. It's terrible now the way everything is going, and the devil is helping them. I tell you that",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,9,6,2,5,14,0,0,1,12,5,18,11,9,1,1,1,0,2,0,0
"904",1578,73,"he did a good deed for himself when he took the great angel away from us and gave us the dawdler who is in now. I don't know how this blunder happened, but I believe that if Ardapilla had been involved it could have been worse. Now I see, mi padre, what a martyrdom you suffered in finding yourself caught between contrary opinions. Had you been given the freedom to proceed according to your own discernment, it would have been clearly seen that God was guiding you. All these daughters send their best regards.
8. I am glad you told them not to discuss this with anybody. Let us go slowly and move ahead with the plan for Rome, for time smoothes things over and there they will settle everything, as you say. I would only like to be nearby where we could see each other frequently, which would be a great consolation for my soul. I don't deserve this, but deserve only cross upon cross. On condition that you be spared, well and good if the cross comes.
9. I am reasonably well, although this head of mine is in a sorry state. God be with you always. Don't tire of writing frequently, for goodness' sake. I am delighted they are not going to elect a provincial, for according to what you say, doing this would be inappropriate. Even though Fray Antonio told me they were obliged under pain of sin to elect a provincial, I did not contradict him. I thought that everything could be concluded here, but if they have to go to Rome for the confirmation, they will also have to go in order to become a separate province. Keep me informed about all that needs to be done in the event that they accept what I proposed.
Today is 15 October.
Your paternity's subject and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with you, my lord. I received the letter you wrote to me on the feast of St. Luke. But in it you do not tell whether you received the supplicatory letters that I sent you. As a result, I am a little worried. In fact, that letter of yours addressed to me to obtain permissions from our Father General as well as from our Father Visitator, the Dominican Padre Fray Pedro Fernández, and finally from Fray Angel, was certainly sent from here. But indeed it seems it ended up in the hands of the Bishop of Osma. It would be regrettable if it was lost along",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,9,15,1,1,3,11,4,14,6,9,3,2,2,2,2,0,0
"905",1578,74,"with my previous letter. I ask you then to inform me in this regard. Now, however, I am not as worried over the fact that you might think you have been responsible, as though in this entire affair you committed or caused the commission of some fault. If there is anyone who has little reason to torment himself in this matter, it is certainly you.
2. The letters of convocation for the chapter held on 9 October were promulgated. I have read them. What the constitutions order to be observed is mentioned in them: let no one be guilty, neither in small matters nor in great, of a transgression or offense against God. Also promulgated is the injunction against going forward with the house of Santa Ana, in effect until tranquility is restored to the province at the end of the visitation.
3. Padre Fray Antonio de Jesús has consulted learned men who affirmed that he was bound in conscience, and he wrote me about this. I answered that if this was really the case, God would in no way be offended; he could do as he wished ... insofar as otherwise they would cast us headlong into tribulation.
4. The Archbishop of Seville, whom it is right that we obey completely, is firm in these words, asserting that he did not do otherwise. Truly in this whole affair he has no reason for moving against those whose only intention was to please and serve God. It seems prudent nonetheless, taking into account the testimonies that were given and the information received, and in consideration of the persons implicated, not to become involved in the promotion of the cause. Rather one should remain silent until it is seen more clearly what the wiser thing to do might be.
5. They were convinced that so things should be if his submission won them over. But in this regard they were mistaken, for from that moment the nuncio seized the occasion to show that he paid little attention to all their efforts. They tried everything, but he was deprived of the power to do anything. Nonetheless, it could be that things will turn out better for him. I cannot convince myself that he had wanted to propose a superior for them chosen from among their own discalced friars, since, as I also made known to you, I cannot rid myself of this suspicion that stays with me as if I were an accomplice in the whole affair. I beg you to try to find",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,1,2,3,0,8,11,3,2,1,14,10,14,12,9,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"906",1578,75,"out from the Count of Tendilla if he ever mentioned a desire to appoint one of the discalced friars, those observing the primitive rule. What he says corresponds to the truth, but could be interpreted as referring as well to the other Carmelites. Perhaps I alone am the cause of this misfortune in that I called the other one provincial, providing the Bishop of Osma, who was the first to write to Rome, a good occasion for doing so.
6. O unfortunate friars, called by their superior to a chapter that became the sole reason for their imprisonment. Padre Antonio received much in writing against his convoking the chapter at this time. Now I am begging these unfortunate friars to be silent for the love of God and to wait and not do anything precipitously in this regard. There is no doubt that they have given the nuncio good reason for being angry. In the very beginning he was forewarned by the other Carmelites.
7. Now believe me, I was never able to bring myself to approve this chapter; it displeased me very much. As a result, I was not one of its promoters. However, others who weighed the matter better than I, made a judgment in its favor.
8. I beseech you for the love of our Lord that, to the best of your ability, you do all you can to avoid arriving at any settlement before the matter has been brought to the attention of Rome. I would be greatly displeased if anything took place without permission from our padre and the others who are there. Please send me at once news about these things. Tell our padre and Padre Fray Antonio that in the meantime they should have patience until God provides a remedy.
9. See how all of this is the work of God who wills that his servants be exercised in patience and put you to the test so that you do not grow fainthearted in those things that pertain to the service of His Majesty. There is hope that Padre Antonio will depart soon -- he is old and sick and our padre would find it difficult to do without his presence and help. If the nuncio bases his judgments on the information and testimony coming from Andalusia, Padre Antonio would be at a loss on how to defend against this and the situation would go from bad to worse. As you yourself will see, this is a question of great importance.
10. Enclosed is a letter",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,5,0,10,14,2,1,2,10,8,11,10,5,2,2,0,0,3,2,1
"907",1578,76,"addressed to Padre Fray Diego de Chaves. Also enclosed for you are the chapter acts transcribed by the one from whom I have received them. No one should read them except you and Padre Mariano, who would have an interest in them. Afterward let Padre Chaves present them to the king; or if he thinks it more prudent, give an account of all that took place while defending the whole affair and the persons involved and explaining that Padre Antonio used the greatest care in making known and energetically publishing the act of convocation and without any offense against God. The fact that he may not have acted entirely well in this matter does not mean he was purposely neglectful or had any bad intention; of this I am certain. Therefore I would like you to hold fast to this assertion and get the others to hold fast to it as well. If we are not united, or you with us, or we with the others, a great trial will come upon us. And people will think badly of you and so will Padre Mariano. I don't have time now to write to Padre Mariano. It is best that, in seeing that others had not wanted to follow his advice, he be led by charity and not think he has any reason to become angry with them. Many such adversities occur in the life of men. I ... Padre Fray Antonio, if you are informed about it, must be very dejected.
11. By that time the deed was done, nor you ... We are greatly indebted to the count. He impels me to praise God. Undoubtedly, our order owes him much; so we must pray always to the divine Majesty for him. May God protect him, and you as well. I beg you not to become discouraged. Few there are with a competence like yours. A good work will be done if you can obtain freedom for Padre Fray Antonio, Padre Mariano, and Padre Juan de Jesús. And may Jesus be always with you.
12. Don't torment yourself any further. God knows how to draw good from evil. And the good is all the greater in the measure that we diligently strive that he not be offended in anything.
Today is 24 October.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
13. I kiss many times the hands of those ladies. The rumor is going about in Avila that the pope has died. But there is no news about this here. It doesn't seem to be",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,3,10,1,8,19,0,4,2,12,8,10,17,10,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
"908",1578,77,"true. I am enclosing a letter to our padre, in which I inform him about everything that is taking place. Be very careful so that it reaches him safely.
14. Take care also that you get back the enclosed letter to Padre Chaves so that you can read it. He will be able to inform you well and tell you about all the trials we are undergoing. Don't forget to write frankly to Padre Mariano about all the other things that are going on. For lack of space I must close this letter. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I am enclosing a letter for Padre Maestro Chaves. In it I tell him that you will inform him about the state of our affairs. Look for an occasion to give it to him and speak with him and tell him about how these blessed fathers are treating us. I think the letter will be efficacious because I beg him with urgency to speak to the king and tell him about some of the harm that we nuns suffered when we were subject to them. May God forgive them, for they burden you with so much work that I don't know where you get the strength.
2. I understand well that the cost for doing this must be great, and it bothers me that on account of the expenses I have here I cannot do as much as I would like. Even though I would like to help those fathers for their trip to Rome, I don't see how I can, for these monasteries must pay their share for the project I am undertaking, which will not be small if everything is brought to a conclusion. But I consider all our effort worthwhile, for if we obtain peace, then we can do what I desire for the one to whom we are so obliged.
3. By the enclosed information you will see what little effect the royal provision has on these fathers. I don't know if they would have any respect even for the king himself, accustomed as they are to getting away with whatever they want, and things are going well for them here. I assure you that having to deal with them now is like struggling in the most dangerous quicksand that exists.

4. I received all the documents you sent. They came too late for these other houses. Let us know how they might be of benefit to us, unless the officials of justice are receiving orders to send these fathers into exile or something like that. This morning was a time of judgment. All who were there (the justices, the learned men, and the gentlemen) were astonished by their irreverent behavior, and I was very distressed. I would have gladly refused to listen to them, but we did not dare say anything.
5. Believe me, they cannot truthfully say they saw us do anything blameworthy here. Pedro was at the door and when he saw them he went to tell my brother. I regretted that my brother brought the magistrate with him, for doing so was useless. What their imaginations dream up will perhaps be given more credit than the truths we assert. For goodness' sake tell our padre about everything that has happened -- for I don't have time to write to him -- and let me know how they all are.
6. The letter from Valladolid that I told you to read and send on to our padre got mixed up with another, for though it was supposed to go, it was left here. It told of how things went with the friars and gave an account of everything, but I told them to write to you about it and also to Medina.
7. Tell me if you heard anything about Fray Baltasar, for he went to see the nuncio, and if those calced friars can legitimately serve notice to our fathers. Here they say that according to the brief only the provincial can do so; I don't know if they are right.
8. You should know it is being said that they are going to bring me to another monastery. If it be one of their own, they would treat me worse than they did Fray John of the Cross! At one moment today I asked myself if they were sending me notice of some excommunication, for a small piece of paper was included with the large one. I don't merit to suffer as much as Fray John of the Cross did!
9. I was extremely delighted that at such a favorable time ... You needn't have paid so much attention to my words, for I know little about litigations and would like to see peace come about in everything. But",1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,2,3,1,0,6,13,1,1,3,11,3,12,15,10,4,6,0,0,0,0,0
"910",1578,79,"I believe that permitting this would heighten the war, but it's enough that the Count of Tendilla is of this opinion. 1. I am confounded and humbled to see what these lords of ours have said. This has placed a great obligation on us to be what they have painted us to be so that we don't turn them into liars. 1. I was amused, daughter, at how groundless is your complaining, for you have in your very midst mi padre Fray John of the Cross, a heavenly and divine man. I tell you, daughter, from the time he left and went down there I have not found anyone in all Castile like him, or anyone who communicates so much fervor for walking along the way to heaven. You will not believe the feeling of loneliness that his absence causes me. Realize what a great treasure you have there in that saint. All the nuns in your house should speak and communicate with him on matters concerning their souls, and they will see how beneficial it is. They will find themselves making much progress in all that pertains to spirituality and perfection, for our Lord has given him a special grace in this regard.
2. I declare to you that I would be most happy to have my father Fray John of the Cross here, who truly is the father of my soul and one from whom it benefited most in its conversations with him. Speak with him, my daughters, in total simplicity, for I assure you that you can do so as though you were speaking with me. This will bring you great satisfaction, for he is a very spiritual man with much experience and learning. Those here who were formed by his teaching miss him greatly. Give thanks to God who has ordained that you have him there so close. I am writing to tell him to look after you, and I know from his great charity that he will do so, whatever be your need. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your excellency, amen. They have told me some news here that made me rejoice, that the marriage between Señor Fadrique and Señora María de Toledo has taken place. Understanding what must be your happiness, I have found that all my trials have been thereby softened. Although I cannot be completely sure from the persons who have informed me, there are many indications of the marriage from the rumors going about.",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,16,1,5,24,0,2,2,11,6,5,8,12,3,4,2,0,0,0,0

2. Here they have informed me of the favor you are showing us all. I tell you that it is so great ...
3. If you favor us in this regard it would be like liberating us from the captivity of Egypt. They have told me that you have given orders to Padre Maestro Fray Pedro Fernández to attend to this affair. It is the best thing that could happen to us, for he knows those on each side. It seems like an idea from heaven. May our Lord be pleased to guard you as a help for the poor and the afflicted.
4. I kiss your hands many times for so great a grace and gift and I beg you to do me the favor of urging with insistence and much ardor that Padre Fray Pedro Fernández go to the court. Consider this to be a matter that concerns the Blessed Virgin, our Lady, who now needs to be protected by persons like him in this war waged by the devil against her order, for many men and women will not enter if they think they will have to be subject to those persons now being imposed on us.
5. We have been much more comforted ever since our fathers have been governing us, and so I hope in our Lord that everything will turn out well.

Written at St. Joseph's in Avila on 2 December.
Your excellency's servant,
Teresa of Jesus Oh, my Paul, how well this name fits you! At one moment raised aloft, at another in the depths of the sea. I tell you we can truly glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Since Padre Don Luis, superior of the Society of Jesus, came to an agreement with Señor Diego de San Pedro de Palma on what should be given in alms to this house because the latter's daughters have entered here as nuns, I, Teresa of Jesus, a Carmelite nun, and the nuns of this house hereby grant with my signature attached the necessary permission required by the lawyer for the daughters of Señor Diego de San Pedro to renounce their share of their inheritance.

Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite nun 1. Jesus be with your honor and grant you a joyful ending of the Christmas celebration and an entry into the new year as happy as the one you procured for me with such good news. For two days previous to the arrival of your letters I was greatly afflicted because of the ones Pedro Ries had delivered. On the morning of the feast of St. John, that other message arrived which consoled us to no end. Blessed be God for such a great favor. I tell you that compared to it, the rest is less painful; although it would console me very much to see the two fathers free. I hope in the Lord that since he granted us this favor he will grant the rest.
2. As for the establishment of a province, may His Majesty do what he sees is necessary. May God reward you for what you did for me by informing the licentiate about the money and all the rest. And even though more was promised, it doesn't matter to me. This will be enough until we receive an answer. As soon as the amount is paid, let me know and I will reimburse you without fail.
3. I beg you to have the enclosed letters hand delivered, for that would be fitting. And always inform me of the receipt of the letters I send you, for otherwise I worry about them, and with good reason. Consider it very important that all these letters be delivered with caution. When I see our fathers free, these other things will not trouble me much, for God will do things better than we can; this is his work.
Give my regards to Señora Inés and to those ladies.
Today is Sunday, feast of the Holy Innocents.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. My lady, you should know that for a long time in all his prayer and with great desires he was asking for trials from our Lord. I saw in this that His Majesty was disposing him for those that he had to give him. And what trials they have been! Blessed be God's name. Now he must find that his soul has so benefited that he doesn't recognize himself. He has enabled us all to receive benefit greatly. I have had very much in mind the pain you both have suffered; but you, too, will have drawn gain from this.

For I am sure, as I said, that our Lord will take care of the negotiations that matter most. There are so many good souls begging this of him, and he will do what contributes best to his glory and service.
3. May His Majesty guide and keep you and the lord secretary as well, whose hands I kiss along with the hands of all those ladies. The sisters here kiss your hands. They are very happy with what has been done. I also am because of what I mentioned. Nonetheless, all of us have to do some penance, for the letters from our padre were always good for our souls and we read them together as though they were sermons. Even this the devil wants to take from us. God is over all.
Today is the feast of the Holy Innocents.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus To my illustrious and Very Reverend Señor Don Hernando, prior of Las Cuevas in Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. What do you think of the way things are going in that house of the glorious St. Joseph and how they are treating and have treated those daughters of his? And this is happening over and beyond all the spiritual trials and grief that for a long time they have been suffering from one who should have been consoling them. I think it is apparent that they have been praying fervently to God for trials. May he be blessed forever.
2. I certainly do not worry much about the nuns who went there earlier with me to make the foundation, and I even feel joy in seeing all that they will gain in this war the devil wages against them. I do, however, feel bad for those who entered there afterward, for when they should be learning about the order and how to remain quiet, they are very distracted by all the turmoil, which can do much harm to souls that are new. May the Lord provide a remedy. I tell you that for some time the devil has been trying to disturb them. I wrote to the prioress to talk to you about all her trials. She must not have had the courage to do so. It would be great consolation",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,1,3,21,2,12,22,4,1,2,5,6,5,7,15,3,2,5,3,0,2,0
"914",1578,83,"for me to be able to speak openly with you, but I don't dare do so in writing. If this messenger were not so reliable, I wouldn't even mention this.
3. This young man came to ask me if I knew anyone down there who would kindly vouch for him for some service job. Since the weather is cold up here and is very harmful for him, he cannot stay here, even though he is a native of this place. The one he has been serving, who is a canon here and friend of mine, assures me that he is virtuous and faithful. He has good handwriting and knows how to do sums. I beg you, for love of our Lord, if you see some opening that would be suitable for him, do me a favor that would be of service to His Majesty, by giving him a recommendation, if needed, for the things I mentioned. The one from whom I know these things would never tell me anything but the whole truth.
4. I was happy when he spoke to me, for it gave me the chance to find comfort in communicating with you and asking you to tell the previous prioress along with the other nuns who came from up here to read this letter of mine. You will have learned how they deprived the prioress of office and replaced her with someone who entered there and how the nuns suffered many other persecutions and were even made to surrender the letters I had written them, which are already in the hands of the nuncio. The poor nuns truly missed having someone to counsel them. The learned men here are astonished at the things they were made to do through fear of excommunication.
5. My fear is that the interrogators have completely confused the nuns. This must have happened without it being realized, for in the process things were deduced from the nuns' remarks that are totally false, for I was present there at the time the supposed events occurred, and nothing of the sort took place. But I am not surprised that they managed to confuse the nuns, for in one case the interrogation lasted six hours, and someone of little intelligence may have signed everything they asked her to sign. We benefitted from this here by being careful about what we were signing, and so they had nothing to say against us.
6. For a year and a half our Lord has afflicted us in all kinds of",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,0,1,9,0,8,17,4,0,3,8,7,11,17,9,1,3,2,1,0,1,0
"915",1578,84,"ways. But I remain most confident that His Majesty will turn to the defense of his servants -- friars and nuns and that the snares the devil has laid in that house will be discovered, and that the glorious St. Joseph will bring the truth to light and make known the caliber of those nuns that went to Seville from up here. I don't know the ones who entered down there, but I know they are given more credit by the one who deals with them, which has been most harmful in many ways.
7. I beg you for the love of our Lord not to abandon the nuns and to help them with your prayers in this tribulation, for they have only God and they have no one on earth to console them. But His Majesty who knows them will support them and give you the charity to do the same.
8. The enclosed letter I am sending unsealed so that if they have been given orders to hand over to the provincial any letters they receive from me, you can have someone read it to them, for it might afford them some relief to see my handwriting. It is thought that the provincial was wanting to expel them from the monastery; the novices were desiring to go with them.
9. What I have come to realize is that the devil cannot bear that either the discalced friars or discalced nuns be in Seville, and so he wages war against them. But I trust in the Lord that this effort will be of little benefit to the devil. Consider all that you have done to sustain the nuns there. Now when they are in their greatest need, give a helping hand to the glorious St. Joseph.
10. May it please the divine Majesty to preserve you very many years for the protection of the poor, for I know the favor you have shown those poor discalced fathers. May he give you the increase of holiness that I always beg of him for you, amen.
Today is the last day of January.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
If it doesn't tire you, you are welcome to read the enclosed letter that is for the sisters. 1. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your charities, my daughters and sisters. You should know that I have never loved you as much as I do now, nor have you ever been so obliged to serve the Lord, for he has given you the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,1,6,19,1,7,19,0,2,1,10,1,6,11,6,1,0,2,2,1,2,0
"916",1578,85,"great favor of being able to taste something of his cross and share in the terrible abandonment that he endured on it. Happy the day you entered that house where such a fortunate event was reserved for you! I envy you very much, and indeed when I learned of all those changes -- for everything was carefully communicated to me -- and that they wanted to expel you from that house and about other details, I felt the greatest interior joy. I saw that, without your having crossed the sea, our Lord revealed to you mines containing eternal treasures. Through these, I hope in the Lord, you will be left very rich and able to share with those of us who are here. For I believe that he will enable you to bear all without your offending him in any way. Don't be afflicted that you feel it very much, for the Lord would want you to understand that you are not capable of as much as you thought when you were once so desirous of suffering.
2. Courage, courage, my daughters. Remember that God does not give anyone more trials than can be suffered and that His Majesty is with the afflicted. For this is certain, there is no reason to fear but to hope in his mercy. He will reveal the whole truth; and some machinations, which the devil kept hidden so as to create a disturbance, will be made known. This was more painful for me than all that is happening now. Prayer, prayer, my sisters, and now let humility shine forth -- and obedience in such a way that no one, especially the former prioress, practices it more toward the appointed vicaress.
3. Oh, what a good time it is for gathering fruit from the resolutions you made to serve our Lord. Consider that often he desires to have proof that our works are in conformity with our resolutions and words. Bring honor to the daughters of the Blessed Virgin, your sisters, in this great persecution, for if you help one another, the good Jesus will help you. Even though he sleeps at sea, when the storm gathers strength he calms the winds. He wants us to ask of him, and he loves us so much that he is always looking for ways to be of benefit to us. May his name be blessed forever, amen, amen, amen.
4. In all these houses they are urgently praying to God for you, and so I hope in his",2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,1,17,0,10,27,2,2,3,14,6,10,10,11,3,0,2,1,1,2,2
"917",1578,86,"goodness that he will soon provide the remedy for everything. So strive to be joyful and reflect that, if carefully considered, all that is suffered for so good a God, who suffered so much for us, is small, for you have not reached the point of shedding your blood for him. You are among your sisters and not in Algiers. Let your Spouse act and you will find that it won't be too long before the sea will swallow up those who wage war on us in the manner of King Pharaoh. And he will set his people free, and everyone will be left with the desire to suffer again, so great will be the gain they feel from what they underwent.
5. I received your letter and I regret that you burned what you had written, for it would have been useful. According to learned men here you could have refused to hand over my letters, but it doesn't matter. Would that the divine Majesty be pleased to let me bear the weight of all the blame, although the afflictions of those who have suffered without blame have weighed heavily upon me.
6. What distressed me very much was that in the investigative process carried out by Father Provincial some things were asserted that I know to be completely false because I was there at the time. Out of love for our Lord consider carefully whether anyone said something out of fear or confusion, for when there is no offense against God, it all amounts to nothing. But lies, lies prejudicial to others, are what hurt me deeply; although I cannot bring myself to believe what was said, for everyone knows of the integrity and virtue with which our Padre Maestro Gracián converses with us and how much he has benefitted us and helped us go forward in the service of our Lord. And since this is so, even if the accusations are insignificant, it is a serious fault to make them. Inform the sisters of this, for goodness' sake, and remain with the Holy Trinity, in God's safekeeping, amen.
7. All the sisters here send their best regards. They are waiting for these clouds to pass so as to receive an account about everything from Sister San Francisco. My regards to good Gabriela, and I ask her to be happy, for I have ever present in my mind the affliction she must have suffered in seeing Madre San José treated the way she was. I do not feel sorry",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,4,8,1,20,19,3,7,7,11,4,8,7,9,1,2,4,2,0,1,3
"919",1579,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor and so favor you that you will gain through these trials. They have caused me grief, and so I am praying to our Lord for you, although I understand from another perspective that trials are favors His Majesty grants to those he loves deeply. He does this to awaken us so that we do not prize the things of this life -- which are so changeable and unstable -- but seek eternal life.
2. This year we have undergone so many storms and calumnies that at first I became all the more distressed by the imprisonment of Señor Albornoz. After learning that it happened over the matter of Don Fadrique, I am left with hope in God that the ordeal will not last long. I kiss his honor's hands and trust that the time will come when he will not want to exchange one day of his being in iron chains for all the golden chains of earth. May God be pleased to give him health, for it enables one to suffer trials better.
3. I don't feel so sorry in your regard, for I think our Lord has given you the resources to suffer even greater trials. May His Majesty increase his grace within you more and more and keep you for many years, amen.
Today is 4 February.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. In view of the desire we have to negotiate, I wouldn't want us to offer to do anything that we cannot easily carry out. It is also necessary to consider whether it would be wise to found a house in Rome, even though now the situation is favorable, or wait until we are stronger. For if those living there, being so near to the pope, become hostile toward the discalced friars -- and they will, because goodness is offensive where faults exist -- a war terrible for everyone would result. But if you should send the letter to the king's canon, your reverences should let him know whom you intend to name as provincial. In the brief they singled out some who, allowing for a few exceptions, I believe, don't know anything. It would be a real trial if they should perhaps choose one of these.
2. For the time being I would not want you to undertake this journey so that those here who are being punished are not left without the help of anyone and it doesn't seem necessary since everything",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,11,2,11,19,1,4,3,13,6,16,14,7,1,0,2,1,4,2,0
"920",1579,2,"there seems to be in good order. If you should have to go, it would be more fitting to wait and go for the general chapter, since it will be the duty of the provincial to go -- that is, if God should want you to be elected. If those who go now are waiting for you, you could represent us as our delegates and free us from our embarrassment.
May our Lord direct everything to his greater glory and guard you with an increase of holiness.
3. I don't have time to tell you more. Thus you won't have to be suffering further annoyance over so many things that are true. I fear that they will let Padre Mariano go without a sentence, for God sees that he is weak. May we be given the strength to die for His Majesty; certainly this brawl has come from his mercy.
Today is 10 February.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
4. But what a letter this is, so characteristic of an old woman with little humility and full of advice! May it please God that some of it be correct; if it isn't, that we still be friends. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I am sorry about the distress our affairs cause you. You should know that they do not disturb me that much, for I understand that they are from God and that His Majesty looks after our affairs more than we do. So, with whatever happens I will be content, for many prayers have been offered for this intention, and by good souls. Thus, perhaps what seems to us most adverse is what is most fitting for his service. Thus you should not be disturbed about anything. The end of the world is not at hand.
2. Since I see that those fathers are well and that justice is being observed, there is nothing to fear. Even if justice is not being observed, there is no better time than now for us to suffer without fault. Furthermore they tell me the nuncio is very much the servant of God, and so he will gather information about everything, and the same goes for the other judges. Since it is forbidden to write or speak to those fathers, there is no point in writing to them, but I would love to console them and tell them how I envy them.
3. I have already received the letter that came by way of Toledo and also this one that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,13,1,15,14,6,2,2,5,9,13,16,5,3,1,1,1,1,1,0
"921",1579,3,"Pedro Ries brought, so filled with doubts that it made me laugh and praise our Lord for your charity and how much you take our affairs to heart. Some day we will be able to serve you.
4. The judges are more than right in saying that they will not do anything as a favor. It wouldn't be real justice if anyone were moved by favoritism rather than the truth.
5. Señora María de Montoya is wrong to think that it has ever entered our minds that the letters brought to the canon will be sufficient to bring our affairs to a close. His Majesty has to do this. But the letters usually help by recommending the petitioners as religious persons and considered to be so in Spain. The more this is said of them, the better.
6. Doctor Rueda sent me the enclosed letters to be delivered to his majesty, the king. Give them to him yourself and tell him I kiss his hand. I would like to have written to the count. I kiss his lordship's hands many times. We were very happy to learn of his son's health. Tell him this and that we are comforted to know that he is in Madrid.
7. Would you send the letter addressed to the prior of St. Augustine's to someone who will hand deliver it, and do not let on that it comes from me or from you. Believe me, that could do us harm. And the one addressed to the discalced Franciscan father should also be sent through a reliable person, for this father is a very good friend of mine. The other one is from my brother. I beg you to give it to the one to whom it is addressed and tell him to send the answer to you, and then send that to me, and pardon me. Except for this last one the letters are very important for the matter that concerns us.
8. I always notice that these letter-carriers deliver the letters to you safely and to me also. There's no need for other roundabout ways. Since these fathers now have what they want, they won't be so diligent. Take care to seal the letter well.
9. Be assured that if I could see our Padre Gracián freed from the task of visitator, I think the rest would be bearable. This is what always tormented me. And if they were to send someone from any other order, I would be truly content, as long as he would not",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,4,0,3,22,1,0,0,8,3,15,12,7,2,2,4,4,2,2,0

Today is the 12th.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 	I was astonished and very angered by the letters from Alcalá, especially by the one you wrote. Oh, good God, how true it is that we do not know ourselves! Well, I tell you, as I have written you before, that after what has been done I am so afraid that I wish you weren't there, and I think this will come about. Would to God you were back with the cats! The threat is a good one. 1. I am shocked and saddened by those two souls; God help them. It only seems that all the furies of hell have joined together there to deceive and blind persons both within the community and outside.
2. Your paternity should know that all the terrible distress I experienced when you wrote me about the process going on there resulted from my having foreseen what is now happening, that they would raise some calumny against Paul. And this miserable vicaress has always been known for spreading some serious calumnies. For days I have been living with this affliction. O Jesus, how it has weighed down on me! All the trials we have suffered were nothing in comparison.
3. God is indeed teaching us what little attention we ought to pay to creatures, however good they may be, and how we need to be shrewd instead of so simple, and, please God, that will be enough for Paul and for me. To the very magnificent Señor Diego Ortiz, my lord.
1. Jesus. May our Lord bestow his divine grace on your honor. I had very much wanted to meet with you during these days, and so I sent word beseeching you in this regard. Since you are not going to grant me this favor and the time has arrived for my departure (which I believe will be tomorrow), I want to tell you about what we began discussing the other day in regard to the sung Masses on Sundays and feast days. I have been thinking about the matter these days, for I had not given it much thought before you spoke to me; nor did I think it necessary to speak about it, for my intention seemed clear in the written agreement. But they tell me I must clarify some things.

"923",1579,5,"Mass on feast days, for then our constitutions prescribed this, but not that the nuns be obliged to sing, for in their rule this is optional. Even if the constitutions do prescribe singing, they do not on this matter bind under any sin. How could I make this an obligation for the nuns! I wouldn't do it for anything, nor did you or anyone ask me for such a thing. I spoke in this way for the sake of our convenience. If in writing this down I made an error, it wouldn't be right to demand of them what should be voluntary. And since they are willing to serve you and ordinarily sing the Masses, I beg you that when some need arises for them you consider it a good thing to allow them their freedom. I beg your forgiveness that this is written in someone else's hand, for the bloodletting has left me weak, and my head can't do anything more. May our Lord keep you.
3. Señor Martín Ramírez pleased me very much. May the Lord be pleased to make him his servant and keep you for the good of all. You will be doing me a great favor if you clarify the matter concerning the Masses. And since the Mass is sung almost every day without the nuns' being obliged, it would be right for you to remove this scruple of ours and make the nuns and me happy in a matter that has so little importance, for we all want to serve you.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, mi padre, and reward you for the consolation you have given me through the hope I can have of seeing you, which will certainly be a great joy for me. And so I ask you for the love of our Lord to arrange for this to come about, for the loss of a joy is not as disturbing as it is when the lost joy is what one was hoping for. I think His Majesty will be served if you come.
2. This happiness has helped me receive well the election of a new superior. May it please our Lord that he hold the office for only a short time. I don't mean that he die, for after all he is the most talented one among them; and with us, he will be very restrained, especially because he has the good sense to understand where a thing",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,13,1,5,26,1,0,2,7,9,13,19,5,1,1,1,2,3,1,0
"924",1579,6,"will end up. In a way those fathers were dealt with as badly as we. For persons seeking perfection, we couldn't desire anyone more befitting than the Señor Nuncio, for he has made us all gain merit.
3. I praise our Lord that Padre Fray Gregorio has already arrived at his house. And I will do the same if you succeed in having the prioress of Seville reinstated, for it is certainly the right thing to do. And if not her, then Isabel de San Francisco, for the present one is a mockery and will end up destroying the house. May the Lord direct everything for his greater service, and reward you for the care you take in looking after those poor foreigners. Since the provincial of the fathers of the cloth is not in command over them, they will feel greatly relieved, for they will be able to write and receive letters. I wrote to them through the prior of Las Cuevas, and I wouldn't mind if the letter fell into the provincial's hands, for I wrote it with this intention.
4. The traveler has everything ready now, and the more I deal with him, the more hope I have that he will do everything very well. We had an argument here because I wanted a copy made of the letter to the king so as to send it with the first shipment of mail to the canonist Montoya along with a parcel of letters that I am now sending his mother for delivery to him. And I am writing him that this letter will be brought to him now, or if not, that two fathers will bring it who are going to Rome to render obedience to our Father Vicar General. And it seems to me that in a matter so serious it is good to proceed along two different paths, for we are not certain of the successful outcome of a particular path. And it would be a troublesome thing in our present situation to have to wait for another trip to be made. Also, since the canonist has already taken up this cause, it is better not to turn aside from his help -- as time goes on, he will prove a good friend, and this business is no easy matter -- for that would do harm. And I hold that it is better for him to do the negotiating and that those fathers go directly to Father Vicar General. I have little trust that their",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,2,2,3,0,6,20,0,3,0,3,10,11,10,9,1,0,2,1,0,0,0
"925",1579,7,"mission will remain a secret, and if they go about negotiating with this one and that and the vicar general finds out, he will perhaps be displeased that they did not come to him first, something that would not be so with the canonist.
5. Padre Fray Juan says that if the canonist does the negotiating there is no reason for him to go, but there is so much to do that there will perhaps be need for both of them. Would to God that he would find that the negotiations were finished. It would still be no small matter if discalced friars got to be known there who had more religious spirit and substance than those seen before. And these friars could explain everything to Father Vicar General. It also seems to him that he would be spending ... For mi padre, Paul, in Elijah's cave.
1. Jesus be with your paternity, mi padre. I had already written this letter when I received those you sent me. I hope our Lord has given you as happy an Easter as I desired and his daughters begged for him.
2. God be blessed that our business affairs are so progressing that the separation will soon end and poor Angela will be able to confer about her soul. For since your absence she has not been able to speak to anyone about anything that might bring her relief. Truly, our afflictions nonetheless have taken up all our attention. It seems to me that you have borne the greater part, since our Lord has so quickly repaid you by the fact that you have been of benefit to so many souls.
3. Señora Doña Juana has now written me a letter concerning the matter of our sister, María de San José. She never mentioned you. Although she said she was writing in haste, that was not enough to keep me from complaining about it. I wrote to the prioress of Valladolid that Sr. María should make her profession when she has completed her year. The prioress answered that the thought of delaying the profession had never entered her mind until I told her to wait. Truly, it seemed to me that a delay would matter little if it meant that you would be able to attend. But it is better now not to delay, since we have such solid hope of becoming a province, and I agree with you that all will go well.
4. My brother kisses your hands, and little Teresa is very content",2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,3,10,0,1,12,0,0,0,14,5,17,15,9,1,3,1,1,0,1,0
"926",1579,8,"and as much a little child as ever.
5. I feel some relief about matters in Seville, now that the calced friars have no authority over the nuns. The archbishop wrote me that the discalced friars were very distressed until the nuncio's decisions arrived; now they are very happy. They are confessors to the nuns, and Fr. Vicar, Fray Angel, says that in a month Nicolao will return there, and María de San José's voice and standing will be restored and there will be an election.
6. From the letters that Padre Nicolao writes me, I gather that he is very prudent and will be of benefit to the order. Before leaving, he will come to see me. This is necessary so that he will better understand what has happened there and I can give him some advice to give to María de San José in the event that she is reelected. Garciálvarez no longer goes there. He says the archbishop forbade him to. May God take care of everything and be pleased to allow me to speak at leisure with you about many things. I understand that all is going very well for you with Padre José. That is what is important.
7. I'm amused to learn that now you are again wanting trials. Leave us alone for a while, for the love of God, for you don't suffer them alone. Let's rest for a few days. I well understand that trials are the kind of food that when really tasted will make one understand that there can be no better sustenance for the soul. But since I do not know whether they will involve others besides myself, I cannot desire them. I mean to say that there must be a great difference between suffering ourselves and seeing our neighbor suffering. This is a disagreement we have that needs clarifying when we meet.
8. May it please our Lord that we succeed in serving him in whatever way he desires. And may he keep you many years in the holiness I beg him to grant you, amen.
9. I wrote to Valladolid that there was no reason for them to write to Señora Doña Juana about covering the dowry since she doesn't have to give it until after the profession, and even then not for certain. And I said that since her daughter was received without a dowry the nuns shouldn't even talk about the matter, for in other places the nuns would lift their hands to God in thanksgiving. I didn't",3,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,12,0,7,16,1,0,5,12,6,8,5,6,2,6,2,1,0,1,2
"927",1579,9,"want to speak of anything else, and I sent the prioress the letter you sent to Señora Doña Juana. So for now everything is settled. I wouldn't want her to say a word about this to Padre Angel, for there is no reason to and it wouldn't be necessary, even though she is his good friend. You know how these friendships can come to a quick end; such is the world. I think you brought me to understand this in one of your letters; although you may not have done so with this in mind. Nonetheless, you might advise her about this, and remain with God.
10. Do not forget to recommend me to His Majesty along with all the other souls you keep in mind, for you know that you have to render God an account for mine.
Today is the last day of the Easter feasts.
Your unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
11. Write to Señora Doña Juana about when the profession will take place, for I don't have time to write her now. I am so afraid to write in this regard that I am not doing so, and will do so as little as possible. I have already answered my daughter María de San José. It would be a great comfort to have her with me. But our Lord is not disposed to give me any. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I received your letter and those of José Bullón. May our Lord watch over him, for it is hard to have to see him go so far, but since the need is great something has to be suffered. We all owe him much; he has the virtue and talents for this, and even more. May God bring him back safely. I beg you to let me know on what day and in what manner he left.
2. I can't wait for him to leave our country, seeing that he is traveling in such a manner. May no misfortune befall us; we would find ourselves in a terrible situation.
3. May our Lord reward you for the good news you sent me. You should know that ever since those lords and those Dominican fathers of mine were appointed assessors to the nuncio, all my worries about our affairs left me. For I know them and with persons like the four of them, I am certain that what they ordain will be for God's honor and glory, which is what we are all",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,2,14,0,4,17,2,0,1,10,4,8,10,8,3,2,1,0,0,0,0
"928",1579,10,"seeking.
4. The ones whom I'm now very worried about are the fathers of the mitigation, for such ugly events cannot but deeply hurt those who wear this habit. May God provide a remedy, watch over you, and repay you for the goodwill you have shown toward this order and your good deeds, which certainly cause me to praise God. Where charity is present, His Majesty provides ways for exercising it.
5. May it please him to watch over your honor and Señora Doña María. Although miserable, I do not neglect to beg him for this and that he make you both very holy.
Today is 2 May.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Madre Isabel de San Jerónimo and Madre María de San José, discalced Carmelite nuns at St. Joseph's in Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. I received your letter and that of my sisters the day before yesterday. O Jesus, and what a great consolation it would be for me to be present now in that house, just as it would have been for me before so as to share in the treasures our Lord has given you in such abundance! May he be blessed forever! Amen.
2. The love I had for you has doubled to the extreme, even though it was great; and for you especially since you are the one who has suffered the most. But be assured that when I learned that they had deprived you of your office, voice, and standing in the community, I felt a particular consolation. For even though I know that my daughter Josefa is very wretched, I am convinced that she fears God and would not have done anything against His Majesty that would deserve such punishment.
3. I wrote you a letter through mi padre, the prior of Las Cuevas, so that he may have it delivered to you. I would like to know if he received it, and another one that was for him, and to whom he gave it, even if I have to write again. When Padre Nicolao learned of what happened with your brother's letter, he tore it up. You owe him very much. You have fooled him more than Padre Garciálvarez.
4. I am sorry that he may no longer say Mass there, although it is the house that loses thereby; for him a great trial is being removed. Certainly we owe him a lot, but I don't know what can be done. If the most reverend",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,3,14,0,12,19,3,2,6,6,3,8,13,4,2,2,1,1,1,1,0
"929",1579,11,"archbishop has not listened to the prior of Las Cuevas or to Padre Mariano, I don't know who will be able to do anything.
5. In a way, these notes from Padre Mariano have irritated me -- that it could even pass through his mind that such a thing be sought in that house, or even spoken of. The fact is that the devil in the excess of his fury has wanted to afflict us in every way, especially in ... Now it seems our Lord does not wish to give him so much license, and I hope His Majesty will so ordain that the truth will be discovered.
6. In that house there has been little truth. It distressed me very much when I learned of the statements made in the process and of some things that I knew were seriously false, since they had to do with the time when I was living there. Now that I have seen what is happening with those sisters, I have given great thanks to our Lord for not having allowed them the opportunity to raise any more calumnies.
7. These two souls have worn me out, and we all need to pray especially that God will give them light. Ever since Garciálvarez began acting in such a way, I feared what I now see. If you recall I wrote twice that I believed that the trouble came from within the house, and I even named one person -- Margarita never entered my mind -- so that you would be on your guard. The truth is that I was never satisfied with her spirit, although sometimes I thought my dissatisfaction was a temptation and that I was a wretch. And I even spoke of the matter with Padre Maestro Gracián. Since he spoke with her so often, I brought his attention to the matter, and so now I have not been very surprised. And it is not that I thought she was bad, but deluded through an unstable imagination, a ready prey for the wiles of the devil, the one behind this. He knows very well how to profit by one's natural condition and poor judgment. So, there is no reason to blame her so much but to have great pity on her. In this case you and all the other sisters must do me the favor of not turning aside from what I am now going to tell you, and believe that, in my opinion, it is the suitable thing to do.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,2,8,0,12,15,3,2,2,15,7,8,11,11,2,4,0,0,1,0,0
"930",1579,12,"And you should praise the Lord that he did not permit the devil to tempt any of you so strongly. For as St. Augustine says, we should think that if he had, we would have done worse things. Do not desire, my daughters, to lose what you have gained at this time. Remember what St. Catherine of Siena did for the one who accused her of being a bad woman and let us fear, let us fear, my sisters. If God were to withdraw his hand from us, what evils might we not commit? Believe me, this sister has neither the mind nor the talent for inventing such things, and so the devil arranged to give her this other companion, and she certainly must have been the one who taught her. God be with her.
8. First, I say that you should heartily recommend her to His Majesty at all times in all your prayers, as we will here, that he might enlighten her and that the devil will let her awaken from this dream in which he holds her fast. I consider her to be a person partly deranged. You should know that I know some persons, although not in these houses, with unstable imaginations who think they truly see everything that comes into their minds; the devil must prompt them in this. And my grief is that he must have made this sister think that she sees what in his opinion is suited to bringing about the ruin of that house. And perhaps she is not as much to blame as we think, as is so with a madman who, if he really gets it into his head that he is God the Father, no one can convince him otherwise. Here you ought to manifest, my sisters, the love you have for God by showing her great compassion, just as you would if she were the daughter of your parents; for she is the daughter of this true Father to whom we owe so much and whom the poor little soul has desired to serve all her life. Pray, sisters, pray for her. Many saints have also fallen and have returned to being saints. Perhaps all this was necessary for her humility. If God should grant us the favor that she come to her senses about what she has done and retract it, we will have all gained through suffering, and it could be the same for her, for God knows how to draw good from evil.

"931",1579,13,"Second, don't let it enter your minds for now to have her leave your community. That would be a great folly and by no means appropriate, for the more you think you are getting rid of hazards, the more you will encounter them. Let time pass, for this is not the moment for such a change. I could give many reasons for this, and I am surprised that you do not see them. Think about this, and God will show them to you, and trust in His Majesty and in those of us who are considering with more calm what is suitable for your community. For now be careful not to speak about such a move and don't even let it enter your mind if possible.
10. Do not manifest toward them any kind of dislike, and be even more gracious to the one who was superior, all the nuns showing her sisterly kindness, and they should do so toward the other nun also. Try to forget the things that took place and let each one consider what she would like done if this had happened to her.
Be certain that this soul must be undergoing a real torment even though she may not be aware of it. The devil will see to that, since he didn't succeed in doing anything worse. He could induce her to take some action that would cause her to lose both her soul and her mind. For the latter it would perhaps require little. This is what we all ought to consider and not what she did. Perhaps the devil led her to think that her soul was gaining and she was rendering great service to God. Don't say a word to her mother, for I feel very sorry for her. How is it that no one says anything to me about how she bore all these things and what she said -- I've wanted to know this -- and whether she knew about her daughter's schemes?
11. I fear that now again the devil will stir up in them other temptations -- that you wish them harm and treat them badly -- and it would make me very angry if you gave them any occasion for so thinking. I have already been informed that those in the Society do not think it right that she be treated badly. Be very careful.
12. Fourth, that she not be allowed to speak to anyone without another nun present -- someone very astute. Nor should she confess to",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,12,0,11,14,1,1,1,17,10,16,14,6,2,5,1,0,0,0,0
"932",1579,14,"anyone but a discalced friar. He may be one chosen by her since Father Vicar General has ordered that they be your confessors without exception. Take care, without showing it, that the two not speak much to each other. Don't put any restrictions on them -- for we women are weak -- until the Lord begins to heal them. And it wouldn't be bad to keep her busy with some duty as long as it would in no way allow her to have contact with outsiders, but only with those living inside the monastery. Her being alone and with only her thoughts can do her much harm, and so now and again let those who think they could be of help spend some time with her.
13. I believe that before Padre Nicolao goes down there we will have a meeting together -- I would like it to be soon -- and talk more about everything. For now, out of charity, do what I tell you. At any rate, those who really desire to suffer do not bear any bitterness toward the ones who do them harm, but rather more love. From this you will see whether you have benefitted from the time in which you had to bear the cross. I hope in our Lord that he will soon provide a remedy and that the house will remain as it was before; and even better, for our Lord always gives back one hundred percent.
14. Consider that I am again urgently asking that you in no way talk with one another about what happened, for no benefit can come from so doing, but much harm. In the future it will be necessary to proceed with great care. As I have said, I fear that the devil will lure poor Beatriz -- the other one I'm not so worried about, for she's smarter -- into some vile scheme, or tempt her to leave. Keep careful watch, especially at night. Since the devil is working to discredit these monasteries, he at times makes possible that which seems impossible.
15. If the bond between these two sisters is broken and something happens that puts them at odds with each other, they will come closer to getting to the bottom of things, and the door will be opened for them to become disillusioned with each other. You will notice that the friendlier they are with each other, the more support they will find for their intrigue. Prayer can do much, and so I hope",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,3,9,0,14,15,2,2,3,9,4,10,15,3,2,2,0,0,3,1,0
"933",1579,15,"the Lord will enlighten them. They cause me much grief.
16. If it's a solace for you to write down all that happened, it would not be bad for you to do so in order to learn from the experience, for on account of my sins I do not learn from that of others. But if Sister San Francisco is going to be the historian, she should not exaggerate but state very simply what has taken place. A copy ought be made by my daughter Gabriela. I would like to write to all the nuns, but my head isn't up to it. I have called down many blessings on you, the blessing of the Blessed Virgin, our Lady and of the entire Most Holy Trinity.
17. You have rendered a service to the whole order; those especially who have not made profession have proved well that they are your daughters. And I pray that they may be so more and more. And let those who have written me consider this letter as meant for them. For even though it is addressed particularly to Madre María de San José and the vicaress, my intention is that it be for all the nuns.
18. I would have liked to write to my sister Jerónima. Tell her that she has greater reason to regret the discredit that Padre Garciálvarez's departure brings to the house than what has happened to him; he is well known in Seville. The poor foreigners are the ones who have to carry the whole burden. It was clear that once it was thought that he committed some fault, the nuns could not be excused from any. But I am sure that, as I say, his virtue is well known. As for the rest, he has been relieved of a heavy load. Certainly we could never exaggerate all that he has endured here and all that we owe him, nor could we repay him for it; only God can.
19. Give him my best regards. I would have written him at great length had my head been up to it, and what I would like to say is expressed poorly in a letter. I am not going to write then, for I might get into some complaining. Since others know about the great misdeeds those two blessed souls said were committed in the house, you would not have been going to extremes by keeping me informed at times -- seeing that I was the one who would find it most painful --",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,4,13,1,8,17,0,0,2,13,6,15,9,13,1,3,1,2,1,1,0
"934",1579,16,"and not wait for those who have so little love for us, as everyone knows, to find a remedy. In the end, the truth suffers but does not perish, and so I hope that the Lord will make it known more and more.
20. Give my regards to good Serrano. I look for the day in which we can repay him for all we owe him. To my holy prior of Las Cuevas send my best wishes. Oh, if I could spend an entire day with him! May God watch over you for me and make you as holy as I beg him to, amen. These sisters have wept more over your trials than I have, and they beg for your prayers. I will write again soon, and the matter concerning Madre San José that you recommend to me will perhaps be settled by the time this arrives. You are doing well now; don't be in a hurry. There's no reason to hold the election until you receive directions to do so from here; there's no lack of diligence here in attending to this matter.
21. If Padre Mariano is there, send this letter to him and have him return it. Since I don't think a letter from me will reach him there, I am not writing now. Give my regards to Padre Fray Gregorio. I would like to have a letter from him. As for the Mass, I don't know what to tell you; don't be in a hurry. If you do not have anyone to say it for you, don't kill yourselves. Let the nuns be satisfied with Sunday Mass until the Lord provides. Thus they will not miss the opportunity for gaining merit. I am feeling fairly well.
22. Padre Julián has been distressed about your trials. I believe that if he thought he could do something to free you from them, he would willingly go down there. He begs you for your prayers. May God give you the strength to suffer more and more, for you have not yet shed your blood for him who shed all of his for you. I assure you that we have not been idle up here.
Today is the feast of The Finding of the Cross.
Teresa of Jesus
23. Oh, how distressed my brother was about your trials! It was necessary to console him. Pray for him, for you owe it to him.

"935",1579,17,"good to me and show more courage than Madre San José's. My regards to Sister Beatriz de la Madre de Dios and tell her I rejoiced that she is now without a trial, for in a letter I received from her, she told me what a great trial that office was for her. Give my best wishes to Sister Juana de la Cruz. For Mother Prioress and my sisters and daughters of Mount Carmel in the monastery of Valladolid.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my mother, and all those dear sisters of mine. I want you to keep in mind that from the time that house was founded I have never asked you, that I can remember, to accept a nun without a dowry or anything else of consequence, which has not been the case with other communities. In one community they have accepted eleven nuns without dowries. Not for this reason are they worse off; their situation is the best of all. Now I want to ask you to do something that you are obligated to do for the good of the order and for various other reasons. And although it lies in your own interest to do this, I want to assume the debt myself, and I ask that you do me this favor. I am worried that what is so important for the service of God and for our peace might fail for lack of money.
2. The enclosed letters from a discalced father, the prior of El Calvario, who has arrived in Rome, show what urgent need there is for two hundred ducats. Since the discalced friars have no one in charge, they can't do anything. Fray Juan de Jesús and the prior of Pastrana -- who have also gone to Rome, although I don't know if they have arrived -- could collect so little that without what I gave them, they brought only one hundred fifty ducats, which they got from Beas. It is a great grace from our Lord that some of our houses can contribute to this need, for after all it arises but once in a lifetime.
3. Padre Nicolao writes me from Madrid that he has found a person who out of deference to him will advance two hundred ducats in view of Sister María de San José's dowry on the condition that your house send him a promissory letter. He will be satisfied with this even if you delay reimbursing him. I consider this",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,8,0,4,18,1,1,1,9,5,10,9,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"936",1579,18,"very fortunate, and so I ask you out of charity that as soon as this letter arrives you call for a notary so as to testify that sister has made her profession. Thus the action will be completely valid, for without this nothing can be done. Send it to me at once along with your promissory letter. The two statements should not be together, but kept on separate pages. Note how important it is that you act quickly.
4. If the amount seems a lot to you and you are wondering why all the houses don't contribute, I tell you that each house does do what is possible, and any house that cannot give anything, like this one, doesn't give anything. This is why we all wear the same habit, that we might help one another, for what belongs to one belongs to all. And he who gives all that he can gives a great deal. How much more so because expenses are so high that it's frightening. Sister Catalina de Jesús can affirm this. If the houses do not provide the money, I cannot earn it, for I am crippled. Moreover, it pains me to have to go around raising money and begging. Certainly for me it is a torment, and only for God can I bear it.
5. Apart from this I now have to raise two hundred ducats that I promised Montoya, the canonist, for he has given us life; and please God that amount will be enough and bring all this to an end. It is a great mercy that money can play a role in the attainment of so much peace.
What I have said is a matter of obligation. What I am about to say now is up to you, although it seems reasonable to me and something that will be pleasing to both God and the world.
6. You well know that you received Sister María de San José because of her brother, our Padre Gracián. Her mother, being in serious need, postponed her daughter's entry there -- from what I've learned -- until she could negotiate over those four hundred ducats. She thought the charity you extended to Padre Gracián would remain in effect and that with the promised ducats she could provide for her own needs, which as I say are many. Now I am not surprised that she is upset at having to give up her plan. But she is so good that despite everything she does not cease being grateful for",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,4,7,4,0,4,20,2,0,0,9,10,8,12,8,0,3,0,1,2,0,0
"937",1579,19,"the favor that has been shown her. With regard to the one hundred ducats, you already know from Padre Maestro Gracián's letter, which I sent you, that he requests that you deduct all that his mother spent on her daughter, which amounts to the one hundred ducats that he mentions there. So the promissory letter should be for three hundred ducats.
7. Don't pay much attention to whether she will inherit anything or not, for everything they have comes from the king's generosity; they have no income. And when the secretary dies, they will receive nothing. As for whatever is left, there are so many brothers and sisters that it would be useless to bother about it, as she wrote me afterward. I don't know if I saved the letter, if I did I will send it to you. Anyway, the promissory letter should be for at least three hundred ducats.
8. What I say is that it would be nice if you would promise the whole four hundred, for she would not fail to send you the other hundred when she has received the money. And even if she doesn't, she definitely deserves something for all the bitter afflictions -- the present ones and others too -- she has had to suffer on account of her son; they have been terrible ever since he was given the task of making visitations. All of this I say apart from what is owed to our Padre Gracián, for if so many nuns have been accepted into the order without a dowry, all the greater is the reason that something be done for him.
9. For her sister who is in Toledo, the nuns did not ask for either a bed or a trousseau or a habit or anything, nor was anything given for her. And they would very willingly have accepted another sister of hers under the same conditions if she had desired to enter there. For God has given them such qualities and talents that the nuns would desire this other one rather than someone else with a dowry. With regard to the one hundred ducats, do whatever you think best. As for the rest, nothing else can be done, for the need is urgent.
10. What must be done when the negotiations in Rome are over is to consider what each house is entitled to and return money to those who have given more. And so this will include your house. For the present let us help one another as we",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,3,8,4,1,6,13,0,2,3,9,4,19,16,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,0
"938",1579,20,"can. I ask Mother Prioress not to oppose what the sisters want to do, for I am very confident that they are no less daughters of the order than the sisters in our other houses who are doing what they can.
May God make you all as holy as I beg of him, amen.
Your servant,
Teresa of Jesus
11. In any case, let Sister Catalina de Jesús read this letter to everyone -- I would be very much saddened if anything were omitted -- and the other enclosed letters from Rome as well. 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence and repay you and all the sisters there for the happy Pentecost you gave me by sending the promissory letter with such good will. It came just in time, for the messenger had not yet left for Madrid. They had written urging me to hurry, so I was overjoyed.
2. I assure you that even had the money been given for my own use, I could not be more grateful. You have all shown your generosity and in a gracious way. May the Holy Spirit repay you. I am asking God to give you back much more than you have given. Read this part to the sisters. I recommend myself very much to their prayers. I wrote to Madrid about what you said so that they could see what they possess in all of you.
3. I have written so much today and it is so late that I will be able to say little here. The first thing, for goodness' sake, is that you take care of yourself so that if God brings me there, I will find you in good health. Father Vicar, Fray Angel, has somewhat implied this possibility in a letter to me. There's some hope. But since I would be just passing through, I wouldn't want to come. It would mean traveling many leagues only to feel more pain for having to leave you so soon. He wrote that he has thought of making me gain merit by confirming an order that I go to Malagón, for by so doing I would gain more merit than if I made a foundation and that on the way I could go to console Lord and Lady de Mendoza, for they are requesting this. And he is sending me the letter from the bishop, saying that I should go at once to Salamanca and buy the house. And you ought to know, my daughter, that there is the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,2,2,16,0,2,15,0,0,1,5,7,16,12,6,1,3,1,0,2,0,0
"939",1579,21,"greatest need of my going there, and they are as silent as the dead, which urges me all the more to provide for them. Look at this poor old woman! And then at once to Malagón. I tell you that all this made me laugh, and I have the courage for more. May God direct it all.
4. It may happen that before I finish in Salamanca, our document will arrive and I can come to you more leisurely. Someone else can take care of the matter in Malagón. There is no lack of suspicion -- and signs supporting it -- that perhaps the calced friars are pleased that I will be so far away and that his paternity will not regret my being far from the Incarnation. My attending to the needs of those monasteries will require time, and there won't be so much occasion for grumbling about my going out; I am not doing so for a mere trifle. May the Lord direct matters so that I may best serve him.
5. He says in the letter that I should take what he is now telling me as a sketch for a painting, for he first has to discuss everything with Fray Pedro Fernández. Until he does this no action can be taken. In the enclosed letter to the bishop he explains himself more clearly. He certainly desires to please him and indeed is so good he doesn't know how to say no.
6. He has approved of a college for discalced friars, but not the monastery for the nuns. And that not for his own reasons, but Fray Antonio de Jesús and the prior of La Roda thought that the foundation would not be opportune. I was delighted because I had refused many times on account of the eight beatas who are there. I would rather found four monasteries.
7. Padre Fray Pedro Fernández has insisted that we not found a monastery until we have our own province, even though he might give the license. And he gives good reasons -- they have written them down for me. For since the nuncio is so easily moved, and there are those who will talk about it to him, we could be harmed. Everything must be well thought out.
8. As for the Casilda matter, I am disappointed. It means that they won't give you anything. I tell you that all they had to do was give you the twenty-five hundred ducats they had mentioned, or at least two thousand. What use",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,8,1,4,14,1,0,2,10,8,11,9,10,1,3,0,0,0,0,0
"940",1579,22,"is all this uproar? Never has there been so much noise for so little ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. I hope that this Pentecost has brought you so many of his gifts and blessings that through them you may render His Majesty the service you owe him for having willed to come to the aid of his people, at so great a cost to yourself. May he be praised for everything. Certainly there is a great deal to reflect on and write about regarding this whole story.
2. Although I don't know all the details of how it was brought to a conclusion, I understand that everything went very well. At least, if the Lord allows us to become a province, nothing will ever have been done in Spain with so much inquiry and authorization. This must mean that the Lord wants the discalced friars for more purposes than we imagine. May it please His Majesty to keep Paul for many years that he may place his effort and find his joy in this work; I will be watching from heaven, if I am worthy to go there.
3. They have already brought the promissory letter from Valladolid. I am delighted to send this money. May the Lord so ordain that the matter will be concluded quickly. Even though the superior we have now is very good, something else is needed for us to be properly established, and, after all, he is only on loan to us.
4. In this letter of his, you will see what is being arranged for this poor little old woman. From certain indications one can suspect that the desire my calced brothers have to see me far away from here is greater than the need in Malagón. This caused me a little distress. But the rest didn't stir any emotions, not even in their first movements -- I mean going to Malagón -- although going there to be prioress bothers me, for I am not suited for that, and I fear failing in the service of our Lord. Beseech him that I might be without flaw, and as for the rest let whatever comes come, for the greater the trial, the greater the gain. In any case, tear up this letter at once.
5. It is a great consolation for me that you are feeling so well, but I don't like seeing you there in that heat. Oh, how each day adds to the loneliness of",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,5,11,0,5,19,2,1,2,13,6,8,12,10,4,1,1,0,0,0,0
"941",1579,23,"my soul at seeing you so far away -- although it seems to be always near Padre José. In this way one passes through life well, without earthly consolation, yet continually consoled. It seems you are no longer of this earth, since the Lord has withdrawn the occasions of your becoming attached to it and filled your hands with what keeps you in heaven. Truly, the more I think about this storm and the means the Lord has taken, the more stupefied I become. And if he be pleased that those Andalusians make some amends, I would consider it a special favor that he help them through the hands of someone else, since it was not in you to rule with the strong hand required for their good. And their good is what I have always desired. I was pleased with what Padre Nicolao writes me in this regard, so I am sending his letter to you.
6. All the sisters here ask for your prayers. They are distressed at the thought that I must go away. I will keep you informed. Pray hard for me to the Lord, out of charity. You will surely remember how they criticize my goings about, and who is the source of their criticisms. What a life! But it doesn't matter.
7. I have written to Father Vicar about the drawbacks to my being prioress, my not being always able to follow the community acts and other reasons. The truth is that I would feel no pain even if I had to go to the ends of the earth as long as it were out of obedience. In fact, I believe that the greater the trial, the greater my joy would be in doing at least some little thing for this great God to whom I am so indebted. I especially believe that he is served more when something is done only out of obedience. With my Paul it is enough to know that I am pleasing him for me to do something with joy. I could speak of many things that would bring me joy, but I fear putting them in letters, especially in matters of the soul.
8. That you may have a few laughs, I am sending you these couplets from the Incarnation, although the situation of that house is rather something to cry over. The poor sisters are trying to distract themselves. They will feel very sad over my going away, for they still have hope, and I do too, that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,9,0,8,20,3,2,2,16,8,11,12,9,1,1,6,3,3,0,0
"942",1579,24,"a way to help that house can be found.
9. The nuns in Valladolid have very willingly given the two hundred ducats, and the prioress has also. If she hadn't had it, she would have gone looking for it. And she is sending a promissory letter for the entire four hundred ducats. I have greatly appreciated this, for truly she stores up all she can for her own house. But what a letter I wrote to her!
10. I was amused at how well Señora Juana knows the prioress -- I was amazed. She writes me that she is somewhat afraid of her, for she has given the money without telling her about it. And truly, as for what regards Sister María de San José, I've always seen that the prioress is very nice to her. For, after all, this shows the goodwill she feels toward you.
11. My regards to Father Rector, and the same to the padre who wrote me the other day.
Yesterday was the last day of the Easter season. Mine has not yet arrived.
Your paternity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus I don't know what this poor old woman is doing that they don't let me rest; they want me to go to Malagón. At the Incarnation they are very unhappy that I am going away, for they still have hopes of having me there. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. Today, the feast of Corpus Christi, Padre Vicario, Fray Angel, sent me the enclosed letter for your reverence and an order under precept of obedience that I go to your house. Please God it wasn't a scheme of yours, for I am told that Señor Luis Manrique asked this of you. But if I can do something to help bring you rest, I will gladly do it, and would be willing to go at once. But he wants me to go to Valladolid first. He must not have been able to avoid it, for I certainly did not contribute to the idea. In fact (between you and me), I did what I reasonably could so as not to go, for I thought that at this time my going there could be avoided. But the one who stands in the place of God understands better than I what is suitable.
2. He says that I should stay there just a short time, but however short, I will be there during the coming month, and hope that, please God, the time will be long enough.",2,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,2,9,0,4,16,3,0,1,9,3,12,7,9,2,1,1,0,0,0,0
"943",1579,25,"It doesn't seem to me that this delay will matter much as regards your concerns. You must keep this secret from Pedro de la Banda; otherwise he will kill us with his contracts, while what most suits us is to have none. If some need arises, you can write to me in Valladolid.
3. The letters did not arrive, but the student's father is going around looking for him. Don't be disturbed, for now I am setting out for a place close to where Padre Baltasar Alvarez is. They tell me that the bishop in that place is feeling well again, which made me happy.
4. Tell Sister Isabel de Jesús that I am very sorry about her illness. I wrote to the prioress in Segovia to tell Señor Andrés de Jimena that if he wants to talk with me he should come here quickly; I don't know what he will do. Father Vicar tells me that he is giving me permission to enter into contracts. My desire is that he not fail to come. We will not have disagreements, with the Lord's help, for I desire very much to please and serve him.
5. Tell my Isabel de Jesús that I wouldn't want to find her in a weak state. Her bodily health is what I desire, for I am content with that of her soul. Tell her this. The messenger is waiting and so I cannot say more than may God watch over you, and regards to all the sisters.
Today is the feast of Corpus Christi.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and watch over you for me, amen, and repay you for the care you take in giving me gifts. The butter was exquisite, like everything your hands have made for me. Whenever you have some more that is good, I will accept it with pleasure if you remember me, for it is very beneficial to me. The quince were also exquisite; it seems you have no other care than to give me gifts. On my part it is a gift to see a letter from you and know that you are well. As for me, I am not so well right now. I have a pain in my jaw and my face is a little swollen, and that is why this letter is not in my handwriting. But I don't think this will matter at all to you.
2. Pray for me, and don't think it provides me",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,10,1,7,16,1,1,1,11,3,12,10,4,4,1,2,4,5,0,0
"944",1579,26,"little joy to have a daughter like the one I have had up until now and will have always. I will not forget to pray for you, and the sisters will do the same. All those in this house kiss your hands, especially the subprioress who owes you so much. Pray for her, for her health is not good. May the Lord keep you for me and give you his Holy Spirit.
October, the end of the month.
I beg for the prayers of those ladies, your sisters. May God give health to the one who is ill, for I am beseeching him to do this, and I ask the same for you, my daughter.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. Señor. May the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, amen, and repay you for the care with which you have so diligently come to the help of all. I hope in the majesty of God that you will gain much in his eyes. Certainly all those to whom you sent money received it at such an opportune moment that I was greatly consoled. I believe that it was God who stirred you to send me so much. The amount of money brought by Juan Pedro de Espinosa and Varrona (which I think is the name of the other merchant) would have been enough to keep a poor worthless nun like myself who goes about in patches -- which I now consider an honor, glory to God -- out of need for some years.
2. I have already written you a long letter about a matter that for many reasons I could not escape doing, since God's inspirations are the source. Because these things are hard to speak of in a letter, I mention only the fact that saintly and learned persons think I am obliged not to be cowardly but do all I can for this project -- a monastery of nuns. There will be no more than fifteen nuns in it, who will practice very strict enclosure, never going out or allowing themselves to be seen without veils covering their faces. Their life will be one of prayer and mortification as I have written more at length in a letter to you. I will write another for Antonio Morán to bring when he leaves.
3. That lady, Doña Guiomar, who is also writing to you, is a help to me. She is the wife of Francisco Dávila, of Salobralejo, if you recall. Her husband died nine years ago.",2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,5,23,1,1,14,0,0,1,8,5,5,8,9,2,1,2,3,4,1,0
"945",1579,27,"He had an annual income of 1,000,000 maravedis. She, for her part, has an entailed estate in addition to what she has from her husband. Although she was left a widow at the age of twenty-five, she has not married again but has devoted herself very much to the Lord. She is deeply spiritual. For more than four years we have been devoted friends, closer than if we were sisters. She still helps me very much, for she contributes a good portion of her income. At present she is without funds, so it is up to me to buy and prepare the house. With God's favor I have received two dowries beforehand and have bought the house, although secretly. But I did not have the means to pay for the work that still needed to be done. So by trusting in God alone (for God wants it to be done and will provide), I entered into an agreement with the workers. It seemed a foolish thing to do. But then His Majesty comes along and moves you to provide for it. And what amazes me is that the forty pesos you added was just what I needed. I believe that St. Joseph -- after whom the house will be named -- wanted us to have the money, and I know that he will repay you. In sum, although the house is small and poor, the property has a field and some beautiful views. And that's sufficient.
4. They have gone to Rome for the papal bulls, for although the house belongs to my own religious order, we are rendering our obedience to the bishop. I hope the foundation will give the Lord much glory, if he allows it to come about. I believe without a doubt that it will, for the souls that are planning to enter will give an excellent example of humility, as well as penance and prayer. They are choice souls. Will you all pray to God for this project, for by the time Antonio Morán departs, everything will be completed, with God's favor.
5. Antonio Morán came here and was a great consolation to me. He seemed to be a loyal and highly gifted man. I was especially consoled to learn about all of you, for one of the great favors the Lord has granted me is that he has given you understanding of what the world is, and so you have chosen to live quiet lives. Now I know, too, that you have taken the",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,5,9,16,0,3,19,1,0,1,10,3,7,7,4,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"946",1579,28,"path of heaven. This is what I wanted most to know, for up until now I was always in dread. Glory to the One who does all. May it please him that you always advance in his service. Since there is no measure to his remunerations, we should never stop trying to serve the Lord. Each day we will advance at least a little further, and with fervor. It seems, and so it is, that we are always at war, and until we are victorious, we must not grow careless.
6. All those with whom you have sent money have been reliable men. But Antonio Morán has surpassed them all. He has sold the gold at a higher price without charge, as you will see, and has brought the money here from Madrid despite his poor health -- although today he is better, for it was caused by an accident. I notice that he thinks highly of you. He also brought the money from Varrona and did so with great care. Rodríguez came here too, and has done everything well. I will write to you through him, for perhaps he will be the first to leave. Antonio Morán showed me the letter you had written him. Believe me, I think that all this care is not only the fruit of his virtue, but also the result of God's inspiration.
7. Yesterday my sister María sent me the enclosed letter. When they bring her the other money, she will write again. The help came just in time for her. She is a very good Christian and undergoes many trials. If Juan de Ovalle initiates a lawsuit, it would destroy her children. Certainly he doesn't have as much a claim as he thinks he does, even though the sale of everything went badly and proved a disaster. But Martín de Guzmán also had good intentions -- God rest his soul -- and the judge ruled in his favor, even though not well enough. I cannot bear that anyone should now claim what my father -- may he enjoy eternal glory -- sold. And the rest, as I say, would only kill María, my sister. God deliver me from the self-interest that brings so much harm to one's relatives. It has reached the point here that it's a wonder if there's a father who cares about his son or a brother who cares about his brother. Thus I'm not surprised by Juan de Ovalle; rather, he has done well by setting this litigation",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,7,2,7,21,1,3,0,10,5,9,10,13,1,1,0,0,1,0,1
"947",1579,29,"aside for now out of love for me. He is by nature good, but in this case it would be unwise to trust in that. When you send him the 1,000 pesos, you should ask him for a written promise to be given to me; and the day that he reintroduces the lawsuit, 500 ducats will go to Doña María.
8. The houses at Gotarrendura are still not sold, but Martín de Guzmán received 300,000 maravedis from them, and it was only right that this amount went to Juan de Ovalle. Along with the 1,000 pesos you sent, he is taken care of and will be able to live here. For this is what he has done, he has come here and now needs to remain. He would be unable to live here other than badly and for only short periods of time without help from over there.
9. His marriage is a good one. But I must tell you that Doña Juana is so honorable and trustworthy that she makes you want to praise God, and she has the soul of an angel. I've turned out to be the worst sister; the way I am, you ought not even acknowledge me as your sister. I don't know why you're all so fond of me. I say this in all truthfulness. Juana has undergone many trials and born them well. If you can send the money without placing yourself in need, do so quickly, even if little by little.
10. The money you sent was allocated as you will see from the letters. Toribia is dead as is also her husband. It was a great help for her children, who are poor. The Masses have been said according to your intentions -- some of them before the money arrived -- and by the best persons I could find, all of them excellent. I was edified by the intentions for which you had them said.
11. I am staying in the house of Señora Doña Guiomar during these business affairs. It makes me happy to be with persons who speak to me about you; indeed, it is my pleasure. One of this lady's daughters, who is a nun in our monastery, had to come out and stay with her mother, and our provincial ordered me to be her companion. Here, more than at my sister's house, I am at liberty to do the many things I need to do. All the conversation here is about God, and we live in great recollection. I",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,8,7,1,1,19,0,0,0,4,5,12,3,7,1,4,0,0,0,1,0
"948",1579,30,"will remain here until given other orders, even though it would be better for me to stay here so as to handle the above business matters.
12. Now to speak of my dear sister, Señora Doña Juana, for although I mention her last, she is not so in my heart. That is certain, for I pray to God for her as intensely as I do for you. I kiss both your hands a thousand times for all the kindnesses you have shown me. I don't know how to repay you other than by praying fervently for our little boy. And this is being done, for the saintly friar Peter of Alcántara has promised to do so (he is the discalced friar about whom I wrote you), and the Theatines and other persons whom God will hear are doing so. May it please His Majesty to make the child better than his parents, for good as you are, I want more for God. Continue writing to me about your joy and resignation to God's will, for that makes me very happy.
13. I mentioned that when Antonio Morán leaves I will send along for you a copy of the patent letters of nobility, which they say couldn't be better. I'll take great care in doing this. And if this time it gets lost on the way, I'll keep sending others until one arrives. For some foolish reasons it was not sent (it was the responsibility of a third party who did not want to -- I'll say no more). I'll also send you some relics, for the reliquary isn't worth much. I kiss my brother's hands a thousand times for what he has sent me. If it had come at a time when I wore gold jewelry, I would have been very envious of the medal, for it is extremely beautiful. May God keep you and your wife for many years. And may he give you a happy new year, for tomorrow is New Year's Eve for 1562.
14. Since I spent a long time with Antonio Morán, I began this letter late; otherwise I would say more, but he wants to leave tomorrow. I will write again through Jerónimo de Cepeda, and since I'll be doing so soon, it doesn't matter that I don't say more here. Always read my letters yourself. I went to great lengths to use good ink. This letter was written so quickly; and, as I say, it is so late that I cannot take time to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,3,8,0,4,20,0,1,2,2,7,9,7,4,1,7,2,3,0,2,0

Your honor should know that some very good persons who are aware of our secret -- our new undertaking -- have considered it a miracle that you sent so much money at such a time. I hope that when there is need for more, God will put it into your heart to help me, even though you may not want to.
Your devoted servant,
Doña Teresa de Ahumada 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. I arrived here in Valladolid four days ago and feeling well, glory to God, and without fatigue, for the weather was very cool. It is something that frightens me, the delight that these nuns, as well as Lord and Lady de Mendoza, found in my being among them; I don't know why. All the nuns ask for your prayers. And the prioress here says you shouldn't write to her, that because she is so loquacious, she cannot carry on a conversation with the dumb. I found my María de San José to be very well and happy, and everyone happy with her. I was delighted to see her; and to see how all these houses are doing, considering the poverty in which they were founded. May the Lord be praised forever.
2. Now a postulant, very capable and talented, has received the habit here. Her patrimony is valued at twenty thousand ducats. But we don't think she will leave much to the house in comparison with what she could, for she is very attached to her blood sisters. Nonetheless the amount will be reasonable, and with what the prioress adds, little will be lacking for the nuns to have a sufficient income; and all want them to have one.
3. As for Paul going to Rome, it would be foolish, something that should not even be mentioned or allowed to pass through our minds. My greater fear is that if he is provincial, he will be required to go to the general chapter; for as far as the council goes, that father is very resolute, without giving any whys or wherefores. There is no need to speak of it, but to praise the Lord for having guided the negotiations in such a way that your going is not",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,1,2,3,17,0,5,20,2,1,1,12,6,14,12,4,2,2,2,3,3,0,0
"950",1579,32,"necessary. All we lack now is another trial to make up for those we've passed through! Not for even a moment would I want you to have this thought in your head.
4. Padre Nicolao was with me in Avila three or four days. I was very consoled that you now have someone with whom you can confer about matters in the Carmelite order and who can help you, for I am satisfied with him. I was very distressed to see you so alone in this order in all you had to do. Certainly, he has seemed to me to be wise and a good adviser, and a servant of God; although he doesn't have that charm and gentle manner that God has given Paul -- few there are to whom God gives so much together. But certainly he is a man of substance and very humble and penitent and honest, and he knows how to win the favor of others. He will clearly recognize Paul's worth and is determined to follow him in everything. He made me very happy. If Paul gets on well with him, as I believe he will, even if for no other reason than to make me happy, this will prove most beneficial, for they will be of one mind. And it will bring me the greatest relief. For every time I think of what you have suffered from those who should have helped you, I consider it to have been one of your greatest trials. So, mi padre, do not be distant with him; either I am very deceived or he will be most helpful to you in many areas. We spoke of a lot of things and projects. May it please the Lord that the time will come for carrying them out, and that this flock of the Virgin, which has cost Paul so much, may have some order put into it.
5. I praise our Lord for your good health. For goodness' sake I beg you as a favor to me to stay as little as possible in Alcalá during this heat. I don't know how long I will remain here, because I am concerned about Salamanca, although I enjoy being here. In all truth I cannot say that I am unhappy anywhere. I think I will try as hard as I can not to stay here longer than this month. I am afraid of some mishap in Salamanca, that a buyer might come along for the house offered to us. It",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,6,0,5,24,2,0,3,12,7,6,16,11,1,2,1,1,1,1,0
"951",1579,33,"is an excellent one, although expensive. But God will provide.
6. So as not to trouble you, I have never wanted to mention how difficult to bear is the licentiate Godoy's daughter in Alba.
I have done as much as I can so that everything be tried, but nothing works. Since she lacks intelligence, she doesn't reason things through. She must be most unhappy, for she will burst out in loud cries. She claims this is due to a heart ailment; I don't think so.
7. I had written to the prioress to write down some of the many things she says about her so that I may show it to the licentiate, and she wrote this, which I am enclosing. And afterward it seemed to me better that he not see it, but that he understand in a general way that she is not meant for us. This is painful for me because we owe him so much, but in no way would she be bearable.
8. Now I will be going there and will learn about everything, but I believe this will be of little benefit, for the things they have written me tell of someone who is without reason. Since she fears her father, she will be best off near him. I have not seen him yet. In a letter I received from him in Avila he asks that she remain in that house until he can find another way of helping her. And this we will allow. I always feared accepting her, surmising the pain he would feel if he saw she had to leave. Well, all that could be done has been done.
9. Best regards to Padre Fray Bartolomé. I was delighted with his letter. May he never tire of rendering me this kindness. I, instead, am so tired now from the visits of all the ladies who come to see me, that I am unable to write to him. Yesterday I had a visit with the Countess of Osorno. The Bishop of Palencia is here. You owe him much, and so do we all.
10. My regards to Father Rector. May the Lord watch over you and keep you in the holiness that I beg of him.
Today is 7 July.
Your paternity's true daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. After I wrote you, the licentiate Godoy came here, which seemed to me most opportune. We talked at length about his daughter, the nun. God has allowed that",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,9,0,8,14,2,0,2,12,8,7,10,10,5,2,1,1,4,0,0
"952",1579,34,"she be accepted in a Bernardine monastery -- I believe in Valderas. And so we agreed that when I go to Alba, I will investigate everything. If I then still think she is not meant to stay with us, he will bring her to this other monastery.
2. This delighted me, for I was bothered by it. From the information given me I think it better that she leave, and indeed necessary, lest by further delay the present opportunity be lost. Her father is bearing all this like a good Christian. In addition, the other day he had an attack of high tertian fevers. Although they are not harmful, he is in agony. Pray for him.
3. You should know that the abbot here is a good friend of the Bishop of Palencia. I also spoke with him, and he was very affable. There is as well a different vicar general. If God gives us the means, we will certainly obtain the license for San Alejo. The prioress is not well. She came here. She is very resolute. Having been close to death, she appointed the licentiate Godoy to be her executor and set up a solid basis for the negotiations. May His Majesty bring this foundation about, as he can, for I greatly desire it.
4. Sister María de San José is fine, and loved by everyone; she is a little saint, and so is Casilda. All the nuns beg for your prayers, as does Mother Prioress very much so. I am doing fairly well, and am happy to be here. I will do all I can to leave soon, for I am worried about the need in Salamanca. Nonetheless, I will be staying beyond this month.
5. I want to tell you about a temptation I had yesterday, and that is still going on, concerning Eliseo. It seems to me that he is sometimes careless in telling me the whole truth about everything. I know well that the matters are of little importance, but I would rather that he be more careful about this. Out of charity, urge him on my part to do this, for I don't think there can be complete perfection where negligence like this is present. Look at what I get involved in as if I had no other worries.
6. Take care to pray for me; I have much need of prayer. Remain with God, for I have written to a number of places and am tired.
Today is 18 July.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus

"953",1579,35,"to Father Rector and to Padre Fray Bartolomé. I ask you for the love of God to write me and let me know how your health is in this heat. 1. Jesus. The Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. And how rightly I can call you this. Although my love for you was great, it has now increased so much that it amazes me. And so I experience desires to see you and embrace you warmly. May God be praised, from whom comes every good; he has drawn you victoriously out of so ruthless a battle. I do not attribute this to your virtue but to the many prayers that have been offered in these houses up here for that house. May it please His Majesty that we may be worthy to thank him for the favor he has granted us.
2. Father Provincial sent me the letter from the sisters; and Padre Nicolao, yours. Thus I learned that you have been reinstated in your office, which for me was the greatest of consolations. Anything else would never have sufficed to put their souls at rest. Be patient. Since the Lord has given you so much desire to suffer, rejoice in its thus being satisfied. I well understand that it's no small trial. If we were to go around choosing the trials we want and setting aside others, we would not be imitating our Spouse, who after suffering so much in the garden from his Passion concluded: ""Fiat voluntas tua."" We need to do God's will always; let him do what he wants with us.
3. I asked Padre Nicolao to give you the advice that he thinks suitable, for he is very wise, and he knows you; so I submit to whatever he may write to you. I only ask you to have as little to do as possible with those who are not among our discalced friars (I mean you and the nuns in matters concerning your souls). Don't bother too much if at times the friars are not available. If communion is not received so frequently, you needn't be concerned. What is important is that we don't find ourselves in a situation like the one in the past. If a nun at times should want to consult some other friars, do not oppose it. I have so little time that I didn't think I would even be able to write to you.
4. My very best regards to all the nuns. On my part I thank",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,0,14,0,4,19,0,2,2,10,7,15,11,4,1,0,1,0,1,3,0
"954",1579,36,"them for the praiseworthy manner in which they conducted themselves. I also thank them for bringing me joy. May the Blessed Virgin reward them, bless them for me, and make them saints.
5. I don't believe you can refuse to accept Enrique Freire's eldest daughter, for much is owed to him. Do what Padre Nicolao tells you, to whom I submit. By no means would it be fitting to accept the youngest one now, both because of her age and because it isn't right that three sisters be together in one monastery -- all the more so in our monasteries where there are so few nuns. You can delay by saying she's too young; don't discourage them.
6. When you can begin repaying my brother, know that he has his needs, for he has had many expenses all together. You know well how obligated you are to him. Oh, how much he has suffered from your trials. May God give you the calm that is best suited to your pleasing him. Write to me at length about everything, especially about those two poor souls, for they have me very worried. Show them favor and strive if you can through means that seem right to you to get them to understand. I am leaving here on the day after the feast of St. Anne, God willing. I will be staying in Salamanca for some days. Your letters can be addressed to Roque de Huerta. All these sisters send their best regards to you and to all the nuns. You owe them very much.
7. These monasteries make one want to praise God on all counts. Pray to His Majesty for Malagón, and for the business for which I am going to Salamanca, and don't forget all those to whom we are indebted, especially those from recent times.
Today is the feast of the Magdalene.
8. There are so many things to do here that I still don't know how I have written this; it was done at intervals. For this reason I am not writing to Padre Fray Gregorio, for I thought of doing so. Write to him and give him my greetings and tell him I am happy that he played so important a role in this war, and that he will as a result share in the spoils. Tell me how our good father, the prior of Las Cuevas, is doing so that I can tell how I should write to him about these affairs.

Teresa of Jesus To the most",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,5,16,1,4,20,1,1,2,12,11,5,6,7,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"955",1579,37,"illustrious and reverend Don Teutonio de Braganza, Archbishop of Evora, my lord.
1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your most illustrious lordship, amen. Last week I wrote you a long letter and sent you the little book, and so I will not be lengthy. I am only writing because I forgot to ask you to have printed along with it the life of our Father St. Albert, which is in a little notebook enclosed with the other book. This would be a great consolation for all of our sisters since it now only exists in Latin. This translation was done by a father from the order of St. Dominic out of love for me. He is one of the most learned men around here and a real servant of God. He did not think this was meant to be printed, for he doesn't have, nor did he ask for, permission from his provincial. But if you are satisfied with it and have it printed, the other doesn't matter much.
2. In the letter I referred to, I give you an account of how well our affairs are coming along and how I received orders to go to Salamanca from here, where I think I plan to stay for a number of days. I will write to you from there.
3. For the love of our Lord do not fail to let me know how your health is, if for no other reason than as a remedy for the loneliness I will feel in not finding you there in Salamanca. And let me know if you have any news about peace in that place, for I am very distressed over what I am hearing around here. If, for my sins, this affair leads to war, I fear a terrible disaster in that kingdom, and that great harm will necessarily come to ours as well.
4. They tell me it is the Duke of Braganza who is fomenting it. And that he is actually a relative of yours pains me to the depths of my soul, apart from the many other reasons there are for such pain. For love of our Lord -- since in this regard you rightly have an important part to play in his lordship's decision -- strive to bring about an agreement. According to what I am told, our king is doing all he can, and this greatly justifies his cause. They must keep in mind the terrible harm that can result, as I",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,1,12,1,14,13,2,1,2,13,12,6,8,6,0,1,1,0,5,3,0
"956",1579,38,"said, and you should look to the honor of God without respect to any other thing, as I believe you will.
5. May it please His Majesty to put his hand to this task as we are all beseeching him, for I tell you I suffer so deeply from what is happening that if God were to permit so great an evil, I would rather die than see it.
6. May He keep you for many years in the holiness that I beg of him for you and for the good of the church, and give you so much grace that you will be able to work out a peaceful solution in his service.
7. Here everyone is saying that our king is in the right and that he has made every effort he can to find out. May the Lord give the light needed to understand the truth without the many deaths there would be by taking a risk. And in a time when Christians are so few it would be a great misfortune were they to start killing one another.
8. All these sisters, your servants whom you know, are well and in my opinion their souls are making good progress. All of them are being careful to pray for you. Although a wretched person, I do so always.
Today is the feast of the Magdalene.
From this house of the Conception of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Valladolid.
Your illustrious lordship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your honor. I received your letter; the favor you do me by writing gave me great joy. These letters that the messenger is carrying are addressed to my brother. I told the messenger that if my brother is not there to turn to you. And so I ask you to open the packet that goes to my brother, take out a letter addressed to our Padre Maestro Gracián, and find out where he is, either in Toledo or Alcalá -- I think he will be in Alcalá. And send this messenger to the place where he is, for the matter is important and is the reason I am sending this messenger.
2. For love of God, hurry to send him on his way, for as I say the matter is important and he must be in either Toledo or Alcalá.
3. Since I had no other purpose in writing, there is no more to say than may God be with your honor and watch over you.

"957",1579,39,"unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. I have been so occupied since the arrival of the messenger who is bringing this letter that I feared being unable to write even these lines lest I leave my duties undone.
2. Señora Doña Juana tells me that you are not well and have a rash and that they were wanting to bleed you. This brother tells me you are very well and portly looking, which took away my distress. You must be suffering from the heat. I have been afraid of it. For goodness' sake, try not to stay in Alcalá any more than necessary. I am doing fairly well. Next Thursday I will be leaving for Salamanca. I am very happy to see how our Lord is guiding the affairs. May he be always praised, and go ahead and speak now that you can, if for no other reason than that you find some relief among so many trials.
4. I have written you twice from here. Sister María de San José is in good health and is an angel. Everything is going very well here, and thanks to the novice who has just entered the income is as usual sufficient. She is also an angel and very happy. May the Lord be with you, for my head is exhausted.
5. I tell you that I laugh when I think that they made you rest for your penance and left us here to do battle unto the end. Please God we will soon see victory, and may he give you health which is what is important.
6. Mother Prioress sends her best regards. She says she doesn't want to write to you until you answer her. She's smarter than I am.
Today is the feast of Santiago.
Your paternity's servant and true daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor always, amen. I received your letter, and the good news you gave me about his majesty's favorable response was a great consolation. May God preserve him for us many years, and all those counselors of his.
2. You should know that when your letter arrived in which you told me that Señora Doña María from Montoya was here, she had already left for Madrid. I greatly regretted not having known this before, for I had very much wanted to see her.

5. Your honor should know that although Padre Fray Nicolao keeps me informed about the negotiations, I am also happy that you do, for even though what gives so much joy is heard many times, one never tires of it. May it please our Lord that we soon see the desired end, and may he give you his holy grace.
It is 26 July.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus To Lord Lorenzo de Cepeda, my lord.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. In a certain way the visit of that relative of ours here has tired me out. Such is life. And because we who by right ought to be so separated from the world have to pay all this respect to its proprieties, you shouldn't be surprised that although I have been here quite some time I have not spoken to my own sisters -- I mean privately -- even though some of them want very much to speak with me. There has not been time. And I am leaving, God willing, this coming Thursday. I will leave a letter for you, only a short one, so that the person who usually brings the money can bring the letter as well. He will also bring you three thousand reales, which they say are ready. This made me very happy. And he is bringing a beautiful chalice that couldn't be nicer. It's valued at twelve ducats and, I believe, one real. The workmanship is for forty reales. The entire amount comes to sixteen ducats minus three reales. It's all silver. I think you will be happy with it.
2. From those made of that metal you mention, they showed me one. Though not being very old and having been gilded, it already gives signs of what it is. It is turning black on the inside at the bottom, which is disgusting. I immediately resolved not to buy one like it. It seemed to me that for you to eat off silver and look for another metal for God would be intolerable. I didn't think I would find one costing so little for such a good size, but this bargain-hunter prioress through a friend arranged the purchase for this house. She sends you",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,6,13,0,3,26,1,2,0,9,3,9,8,7,4,4,0,0,3,0,1
"959",1579,41,"her regards, and because I am writing, she will not write. Her talent and the way she cares for this house is something to praise God for.
3. My health is the same as it was in Avila and even a little better. As for those around you, it is better to pretend you don't notice anything. It is preferable that the melancholia -- and it couldn't be anything else -- manifest itself in this form rather than in some worse form. I am happy that Avila has not died. After all, since he is well-intentioned, God has granted him the grace to take sick in a place where he has been so carefully cared for.
4. I am not surprised by your trouble, but I am surprised that you have such desire to serve God and at the same time find so light a cross so heavy. You will at once say that it is for the purpose of serving God more that you do not want him living with you. Oh, brother, how we fail to understand ourselves, for a little self-love lies in everything.
5. Don't be surprised by Francisco's instability; that goes with his age. And you shouldn't think -- although this is a different matter -- that everyone must be as exact as you are in everything. Let us praise God that he doesn't have other vices.
6. I will stay in Medina three or four days at the most, and less than eight in Alba; it will take two days to go from Alba to Medina -- and then to Salamanca.
7. In this letter from Seville you will see that they reinstated the prioress in her office, which made me very happy. If you want to write to her, send the letter to me in Salamanca. I have already told her to remember to continue paying back the money they owe you since you need it; I will take care that they do so.
8. Fray Juan de Jesús has arrived in Rome.[ The negotiations here are going well. Montoya, the canonist who was carrying on our business for us in Rome, passed by on his way with the cardinal's hat for the Archbishop of Toledo. He won't be needed any more.

11. Yesterday was the feast of St. Anne. I thought of you and how you are devoted to her and that you are going to build a chapel in her honor, or may have already done so, and I rejoiced.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus To the very magnificent Señora Doña Isabel de Jimena, my lady.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor always and give you the grace to understand how much you owe the Lord. Despite dangers so dangerous as youth, wealth, and freedom, the Holy Spirit gives you light to want to leave them aside. And the things that usually frighten souls, such as penance, enclosure, and poverty, enabled you to understand their value and also the delusion and loss that would have been yours had you followed after the former dangers. May the Lord be blessed and praised forever.
2. This is the reason you have so easily persuaded me that you are very good and capable of being one of our Lady's daughters by entering her holy order. May it please God that you will advance so far in your holy desires and works that I won't have to complain of Padre Juan de León. He sent me information that left me so satisfied that I didn't need to know anything more. I am so consoled with the thought that you will become a great saint that I would be very satisfied in just having you without anything more.
3. May the Lord repay you for the alms you have resolved to give wherever you enter, for the amount is large. Doing this must be very consoling to you since you are doing what the Lord counsels -- to give yourself to him -- and what you have to the poor for love of him. Considering what you have received, I don't think you could have fulfilled your obligation with a smaller amount. Since you are doing all you can, your offering is no small matter nor will what you receive in return be small.
4. Since you have seen our constitutions and rule, I have nothing to say but that if you carry on with this decision you may enter at whatever time you",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,5,21,0,6,20,1,3,1,12,7,11,16,4,1,2,0,0,0,1,0
"961",1579,43,"settle on, and you may choose from among our houses the one you prefer. In all of this I want to please my Padre Juan de León, leaving the choice to you. Truly, I would have liked you to take the habit in the house where I am living, for I certainly desire to make your acquaintance. May our Lord direct everything for his greater service and glory, amen.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I received your letter; also, the chaplain who brought it came to speak with me. May the Lord reward you for the favor you always show me. I feel your trials so deeply that if by this I could provide a remedy, your trials would be over. But since I am so wretched, I merit little before our Lord. May he be praised for everything. For since he permits this, it will serve to bring you greater glory. Oh, my lady, how deep are the judgments of this great God of ours! The time will come when you will prize your troubles more than all the repose you have had in this life. Now the present trial is painful to us, but if we think of the path His Majesty took in this life, and all those who we know rejoice in his kingdom, there should be nothing that would give us greater joy than to suffer, nor could there be any safer assurance that we are proceeding well in God's service.
2. This is what has consoled me now on learning of the death of this saintly lady, the Marchioness of Velada, over which I have experienced deep sorrow. Most of her life was a cross, so I hope in God that she is delighting in that eternity that has no end. Take courage, for when these trials are over -- and this will be soon, with the help of God -- you and Señor Albornoz will rejoice in having suffered them and will experience the benefit in your souls. I kiss his hands. I greatly wish you were here; it would be for me a great grace. May our Lord grant you every blessing, as he can and as I beg of him.
It is 17 September.

"962",1579,44,"me you were in Valladolid. I was happy that you and Señora Doña María arrived there in good health. I rejoice that you are going to Madrid because you will help me there in everything as always. Let me know where you will be staying, for I have many letters to send you there.
2. You may have learned how well the negotiations within the order have gone. As for what you wrote to me about Rome, it grieves me that they are so financially pressed. I have already written to them, and if Padre Nicolao has not sent the letters, do me the favor of sending them.
3. In regard to the dispensation, the one involved came here to speak with me. He is very sorry that they failed him. Soon, with the help of God, it will be given.
4. In respect to the fifty ducats about which you wrote, I sent a message to Padre Nicolao to pay you, for he has my ducats.
5. I am delighted that the good Padilla is well. If you write to him, please give him my regards.
6. I kiss Señora Doña María's hands. Mother Prioress kisses those of your honor. All of the nuns are concerned about your business affair. May the Lord work it out for his holy service and watch over you with an increase of his grace.
At St. Joseph's in Salamanca, 10 October.
Please pardon my having another person write this for me; my head is in a bad condition.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I did not think I would be able to write to you, and since Mother Prioress has written, I will say no more here than that Padre Nicolao is very set on your not entering anywhere else than in the monastery that with the Lord's favor will be founded in Madrid. We hope in His Majesty that this will come about soon. If you have the patience to wait a little longer after having already waited so long, no one must know of your plan or that a foundation will be made there. This is very important.
2. The nuns in the monastery of Salamanca have already agreed to accept you. I say this because if there is some doubt over the other new foundation, you can be certain of being received in Salamanca. But for some reason it seems to Padre Nicolao that it is more fitting for God's service that you help",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,3,13,1,5,23,1,0,2,7,9,7,13,5,1,3,2,2,1,2,0
"963",1579,45,"that foundation, and the aim of all of us is nothing else than the service of God. Padre Nicolao will soon be coming from Seville; in the meantime consider what will be more satisfying to you. May His Majesty guide things to your desired goal and make use of your soul for what renders him the most honor and glory, amen.
3. It consoled me very much to see the great happiness of your sister, and ours, Encarnación. If you are as good, we will be happy. Certainly she is an angel. She has rejoiced to be with me.
Today is 19 November.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and make you as holy as I beseech of him each day. I received your two letters through Father Prior of La Roda. One of them must have reached me when I was in Toledo.
2. I praise our Lord to see the desire you have to leave the world, for such disillusionment with it cannot come but from above. So I hope in God's divine mercy that you will render him truly genuine service responding to such good desires with the works of a true daughter of the Blessed Virgin, our Lady and Patroness. Certainly I would not want to impede for one day so great a call. I desire to explain to you in complete openness the intention I have in this matter, for you are already our sister and my lady.
3. You should know that several years ago many persons implored me to found a monastery in Madrid. Because of the great weariness I experienced with some ladies there during my eight-day stay on my way to Pastrana, I refused. Now, since we have had so many trials and I see the benefit that could come to the other monasteries by our having a foundation there, I am convinced this should be done. But there is a great obstacle, for they assure me that the archbishop will not give the license unless the house is founded with an income. And although there are some persons who could give a good one and have been desiring to do this for years, they are not free to give anything before they enter. And since your honor is able to help very much in this matter, it seems to Padre Nicolao and me that you should wait for some days. With God's help, I don't think the delay would be longer",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,2,18,0,1,29,0,0,1,6,10,16,9,8,3,0,0,0,0,1,0
"964",1579,46,"than you say.
4. Pray about this, and if you think otherwise, feel free to let me know, and you can enter when your wish. But that would put in danger a foundation in Madrid, and if you might be the means through which such a great work could be accomplished, I would consider this something wonderful. May our Lord do what is for his greater glory.
5. Father Prior came so late that I wasn't able to speak to him much about this matter. Tomorrow I will do so and tell you in this letter his opinion. Since I will be very busy with a matter that he will tell you about himself, I am writing tonight. I am fairly well, glory to God, although I arrived tired; and all that I found here was enough to tire me more. May His Majesty be served by this, and keep you for many years that you may employ them in the service of this our great God and Lord.
6. I beseech you to give my best regards to Padre Valentín. Each day I recommend him to His majesty and beg him to repay me. Even if he does so in a small way, I will be well rewarded, wretched as I am.
Today is 3 December.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
7. Note that what I have said here is for you alone. I don't ever remember having said so much about it.
8. Truly, we did speak a long time today concerning your situation, about which I have nothing else to add. I was very much consoled by his reverence's presence. He will tell you about everything, and inform me about what you and he agree on, which I am certain will be for the best. 1. I am displeased by how these nuns are placed in higher positions. I am speaking of that subprioress. She must be unaware. If she does well, do not dishearten her. For mi padre Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios, Alcalá.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. You should know that I was already in Malagón when they gave me Paul's letter. So, it wasn't possible for me to stay longer in Toledo as he ordered me in the letter. This worked out better, for on the feast of the Immaculate Conception these sisters moved to the new house. I had already been here for eight days, which were no less burdensome than those spent in travel, for",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,1,2,10,0,4,19,0,1,2,10,3,10,12,6,0,6,1,0,2,0,0
"965",1579,47,"there was much to be done so that the move could be made on that special day. I got very tired; nonetheless I am feeling better than usual.
2. I am sorry about the trouble you had; there is nothing more I can do. The move took place with much rejoicing, for they came in procession with the Most Blessed Sacrament from the other house. The nuns were very happy; they seemed like little lizards that come out into the sun in summer. Certainly they suffered a lot there; and even though nothing is finished except eleven cells, they could go on living here for many years even if nothing more were done.
3. Oh, mi padre, how necessary was my coming here, whether for this move -- it doesn't seem they would have been able to make it so quickly -- or for the rest of the things. God could have done it, but I don't know now what other means could have been used there to break this spell. The nuns have come to understand how foolishly they were behaving. The more I learn about the way they were governed by the one who was presiding here, the more convinced I become of how reckless it would be to put her in any position of government. This poor licentiate seems to me to be a great servant of God, and I believe it is he who is less at fault. That other person deserves all the blame, for she kept him on the go constantly with her noisy restlessness. He is in complete accord with all that I tell you should be done here, and he is so humble and sorry for any fault he might have had for what happened that I was very edified.
4. Paul and I are much to blame. Tell him to confess this, for I have already done so. We gave too much leeway in some matters and should not have trusted so much in young people, however holy, not at all.Since they don't have experience, with good intentions, they cause great havoc. It is necessary, mi padre, that we keep this in mind for the future. I hope in our Lord that all will go well now. The prioress we brought is very God-fearing and wise, and has so good a knack for governing that all have grown to love her greatly. She urgently asks for your prayers. She is very much your daughter. I don't think anyone else could have been",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,9,0,10,16,1,2,1,12,8,11,13,8,0,1,1,0,2,1,0
"966",1579,48,"chosen who is so apt for this house. Please God she will always be so, for it seemed the other one would do very well.
5. It's a terrible thing, the harm that a prioress can cause in one of these houses. Even though the nuns see things that scandalize them -- which they often did in this case -- they think they should not judge badly, that it would be against obedience. I tell you, mi padre, the one who makes a visitation must proceed very carefully so that the devil doesn't use some small things to cause much harm.
6. May God have Fray Germán with him in heaven; he had good qualities, but he did not have the talent to understand better the nature of perfection. Our Lord is acting in such a way that it seems he does not want some things to be concealed. Please God that I am not at fault for having insisted so much on bringing a confessor here with me -- that is, Fray Felipe -- or Fray Germán for having opposed me in this. Since Father Vicar finally did what I wanted, Fray Germán was so displeased that he told someone who went to see him that he was sick in bed because of me. But in my opinion I would have been doing nothing had I arrived without a confessor, and there wasn't any other. Nonetheless, I have become fearful lest I committed some fault. Write to me what you think, for there is no one I ask who satisfies me.
7. Through Padre Fray Gabriel, I wrote the other day to Father Rector there so that you might receive some news about me. I did not dare write to you, although I truly believe I could have. This father came here, but I cannot understand his purpose for doing so, although he spoke about the project of a monastery in Villanueva. Now that I have been well informed about it, I think it would be the most foolish thing in the world to agree to it. And Padre Fray Antonio de Jesús has got it into his head that the foundation should be made. I made a strong appeal to their conscience. I don't know what they will do.
8. He also was attending to the matter of Doña Isabel de Osorio, the sister of the one he placed in Toledo. But Doña Isabel and I and Nicolao had already dealt with this matter. He seemed better than usual, but",0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,10,0,8,15,1,0,0,14,11,10,15,5,2,1,0,1,1,0,0
"967",1579,49,"he is so simple about some things that I was amazed.
9. With regard to his being definitor, according to what Father Vicar writes to me, the purpose was to honor the discalced friars; at least he gives that impression. I don't know what harm can come to them for doing this or if he can be blamed for their having elected him. They are keeping this election very secret. Don Luis Manrique told him that the documents were already sent to Rome. I asked him if they were sending them to the chapter. He answered that since the king was a petitioner they would not do that. He didn't stay more than a day, for he had thought I was in Toledo; and since he didn't find me there, he came here.
10. I am amused by Paul's pride. It's about time! Have no fear that I am saddened by that or think that it causes him harm. That would be most foolish -- which he is not -- unless one recalls this waterwheel with its buckets that are as quickly filled as emptied. I well remember the journey from Toledo to Avila with him, how nice it was and without my suffering any illness. Happiness is a great thing, and it seems his letter has now brought me relief from my work. Thank him for me.
11. I don't think I will be able to stay here all of January, even though this place is not a bad one for me, for there are not so many letters or so much to attend to. Father Vicar is so eager for a foundation in Arenas and that we meet there that I believe he will give me orders to finish up quickly here, and truth to say most of the things are done. You wouldn't believe all that I owe him. He treats me with the utmost kindness. I tell you that I remain very much obliged to him, even though his office is coming to an end.
12. Read the enclosed letter from the good Velasco. Be careful about speaking of this if his sister does not have a genuine desire and is not suited (for I would be very sorry if something unpleasant happened, since I like him very much); nor should you say anything about where she might enter. I believe that to him, to Padre Maestro Fray Pedro Fernández, and to Don Luis we owe all the favor now being shown to us.
13. May God show you",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,2,1,0,11,18,1,1,3,13,7,10,16,4,0,3,0,0,1,0,0
"968",1579,50,"this favor, mi padre, as I beseech him and keep you for many years, amen, amen.
Today is 12 December.
May God grant you a blessed Christmas with the increase in holiness I desire for you.
Your paternity's true daughter and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. I recently wrote you a long letter by way of Toledo, and so now I will be brief. Also they told me late that the one bringing this letter, who is the brother-in-law of Antonio Ruiz, is leaving before dawn. I would really have wanted a letter from you, even though without one I was happy to receive the news of your health and of the good you are doing in that place through your preaching. He told me of your sermon on the feast of San Eugenio. May God be praised from whom comes all good. He grants a great favor to anyone he selects as a means to bring benefit to souls.
2. I forgot to mention how Ana de Jesús is doing very well; and the other nuns, it appears, are content and at peace. I do not allow that person to speak to or confess any of the nuns. As for the rest, I show him much kindness, which is necessary, and I often speak with him.
3. Today he preached for us, and he is certainly a good man and he wouldn't maliciously do any harm to anyone. But I am convinced that it is better for the nuns in these monasteries to speak little with others, even if these others are holy, for God will teach the nuns. And unless the teaching is given from the pulpit, a great deal of conversation, even if it is with Paul, is not beneficial; rather it is harmful, however good the topic. It causes such persons to lose some of the credibility that with good reason they should enjoy.
4. Oh, mi padre, what grief I have undergone at times over this. And how I remember during these days what a letter from you made me suffer on Christmas night a year ago. May God be praised who now gives us better times. Certainly it was a night that were I to live many years I would not forget.
5. I am no worse than usual; rather I am feeling healthier these days. We are doing well in the new house. It will be a very good one if it gets finished. But even now, there",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,25,1,6,28,0,0,3,5,6,11,14,5,0,3,1,0,2,0,0
"969",1579,51,"is plenty of living space. The prioress and all the sisters recommend themselves much to your prayers, and I to those of Father Rector. It is already night, so I'll say no more except that it would be a very blessed Christmas for me if I could hear the sermons you will be preaching for the occasion. May God give you a blessed Christmas and many others as I desire.
Today is the feast of Our Lady of the ""O,"" and I am your paternity's daughter and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. Today, the feast of St. Thomas, Serrano arrived. I welcomed your letter, for I wanted to know if you had a good trip. May God be blessed who grants us so much favor. May it please him to grant you the same on your return, which you will not undertake very willingly. A willing spirit helps to lessen the burden of it.
2. I thought your reverence would have received two of my letters; at least one, for I wrote it as soon as I arrived here, which was the feast of St. Catherine. I sent both to Señor Francisco Doria.
3. On the feast of the Immaculate Conception, God was pleased that we move into the new house; although the move cost me a great deal of work, for much had to be done on it before we could move in. And so I remained here eight days before the nuns came, and got very tired. But I considered it all well worth it, for even though much still needs to be done, the sisters are settled in very well. The rest the Lord has done in a way better than I deserve.
4. I am amazed at the havoc the devil works through bad government and at the fear, or deception, he inculcated in these nuns, for, they are all good and desirous of perfection. And in what they saw was wrong, most or almost all of them felt an uneasiness, but didn't know how to correct it. Now they are truly freed from deception, and I firmly believe that there isn't one of them who would want anything else than what she has now, not even Brianda's sister, for Brianda was delighted not to have to come here.
5. I tell you, mi padre, it is necessary to be careful about who is given these offices, for the nuns are so submissive that their greatest disturbance came from",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,2,20,0,8,21,3,0,0,6,1,12,11,8,1,2,1,0,2,0,0
"970",1579,52,"the scruple they felt over judging their prioress to be doing something bad, and in itself what she was doing was not good. They are most happy with their present prioress, and they are right in being so. What two or three must have regretted was the removal of the confessor, for the others -- I think all the rest of them -- were delighted. I immediately told them that we didn't bring the permission for him to be the confessor of any of us. All the others, to repeat, were delighted. I tried to do everything secretly but spoke with him very clearly. And I truly think he is a soul of God and that there wasn't any malice in him. Since we live far away from him and he has much to do, what I did was done without attracting any notice. And I arranged to have him preach to us, and I see him sometimes. Everything has now been cleared up, glory to God.
6. What I regret are the many debts they have. Everything is in ruin, since they have had such bad government for so long. They well understood what would happen, but she didn't give them an account of anything. Since she had been a nun for so short a time, she couldn't have known more. This resolve to trust only in one's own opinion does great harm.
7. Advise the one who is now going to begin again so that she understand well her obligations according to the observance of the order's directives and the constitutions, for in such observance they cannot err. When they do otherwise, God wants their very closest friends to be their accusers. And they shouldn't think they can do and undo whatever they want as married people. And show her this letter. Sometimes I get angry with her and the rest of them that I brought from up here, since they never informed me of anything, although at first not much happened compared to what took place later.
8. If a nun wants to confess with someone other than the ordinary confessor, designate someone to give this permission, as long as the confessor be a friar of your choice from Los Remedios. Even in this respect they suffered great torment here. They are souls who have suffered many things hard to digest.
9. I've been told that the nuns there wrote to the nuns here urging them to ask for Brianda, for since they succeeded there in having the prioress",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,15,0,9,16,0,1,5,16,5,11,14,9,1,1,2,0,1,0,1
"971",1579,53,"they wanted, they thought the nuns here could as well. Give the prioress a good penance, for she should have known that I am not so bad a Christian as to insist so much on something without serious reasons and that I would not have gone to such expense in buying the house without it being necessary. I pardon them for the judgments they must have made in this regard. May God pardon them. May it please God that if I should see that this prioress would not be bad for them that I would try to bring her back as I did for their prioress. I tell you that if she were to return, the peace of this house would be completely destroyed, aside from all the rest. In so serious a matter one ought not speak from afar against the deeds of someone who would give up her own rest for the good and tranquility of another soul.
10. I learned some days ago that the friars in Pastrana were sick. I haven't learned anything more. They must be well now. Don't be disturbed, nor for this fail to do what needs to be done down there, although whatever is not finished by the Feast of Epiphany will require much prudence. For the response from Rome, if God gives it to us, will require that you be back here on time.
11. Before the feast of the Immaculate Conception, Fray Gabriel, the prior of La Roda, came to see me. He indicated to me that he came for the matter concerning Doña Isabel Osorio. I asked him to wait until we know whether what she brings would help the foundation in Madrid, for Doña Luisa told me that the archbishop would not give his permission unless the foundation were to have an income, and I don't know how it can have one even if she gives everything she has. Someone would have to advance us the amount knowing for certain what she will give. For she can't do anything before her entry. We will speak about it here.
12. The secret that was kept about sending a message to Rome pleased me. He told me that it was already gone and that Don Luis was the one who had informed him. He's convinced that with the king asking for it, the permission will come quickly and that they will not wait for the chapter. Please God this will be so. I let on that this was all news to",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,3,8,0,7,11,1,1,1,10,6,20,12,8,2,2,0,0,1,0,0
"972",1579,54,"me. He says he is delighted, and he has every reason to be. The rest must wait until we see each other.
13. The prioress in Beas has sent me letters for Casademonte. She is asking him to decide where he wants her to send the one hundred ducats that she has there. So you need not be concerned about this.
14. What you tell me about the archbishop is a great consolation. You are very wrong not to give him my best regards. Give them to him now. You can tell him that I pray to the Lord for him each day particularly at communion time.
15. May His Majesty protect you and bring you here in good health, and do not fear that I will let you leave so quickly.
The prioress sends you her regards. Among the others, some are looking forward to your coming.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
16. Padre Fray Felipe is doing well. Best regards to Padre Fray Gregorio from me and his sister; she is very good and cannot contain her happiness. It would be appropriate for the prioress to be the mistress of novices, lest their love be divided and not centered on the prioress, since there have been so many changes. She could have someone help her instruct them. And in regard to interior matters about their prayer and temptations, inform her that she should not ask for more than what they willingly tell her (as is stated in the document you had others sign); this is important. I am delighted that Father Prior of Las Cuevas is satisfied. Truth is a great thing. Give him my regards. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. In Padre Fray Nicolao's letter, I enlarged on some things that I will not mention here because you will be seeing them. Your recent letter is so kind and humble that it deserves a long response. But you want me to write to the good Rodrigo Alvarez, and so I am doing that and don't have the head for much more. Serrano says he will give these letters to the one who will deliver them to their destination. Please God this will be so. I was happy to see him and regret that he must leave. I am so grateful to him for what he has done in a time of such need that you didn't have to remind me. I will try to get him to return there, for it",1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,8,0,3,19,1,0,1,3,5,10,4,4,4,2,0,1,1,1,0
"973",1579,55,"is very important for us to have someone we can trust in that region.
2. Here my health is not as bad as it is in other places. I felt sorry over your poor health, about which Sister Gabriela wrote me. The trials were so great that even if you had a heart of stone, they would have done you harm. I would not have wanted to contribute to them. Please pardon me, for with those I truly love I am unbearable, for I wouldn't want them to err in anything. The same happened with Madre Brianda to whom I wrote terrible letters, but they did little good.
3. Certainly, in a way, I consider that what the devil contrived in this house was worse than what happened there in Seville. For one thing, it lasted longer, and for another the scandal was much more damaging to outsiders, and I don't know whether the community will be left as unharmed; although a remedy has been found for the disquiet inside. The Lord has smoothed things over. May he be blessed, for the nuns are not much to blame. The one with whom I am more annoyed has been Beatriz de Jesús, for she has never said a word to me, not even now on seeing that all the nuns are telling me about it and that I am aware of everything. This has seemed to me to be a sign of very little virtue or discretion. She must think she is being loyal to a friendship; but in truth she is very attached to herself, for true friendship does not show itself by hiding what, if revealed, could have provided a remedy without so much harm.
4. For the love of God be on guard against doing anything that if known could cause scandal. Let us free ourselves from these good intentions that cost us so dearly. And don't say anything to anyone about this father from the Society eating there, not even to our own discalced friars. For if they know, the devil, being what he is, will stir up a fuss about it. Don't think that it cost me little for the rector to become gentler -- and here they all have become so -- for I tried hard even to the point of writing to Rome from where I believe the remedy has come.
5. I am most grateful to that saintly Rodrigo Alvarez for what he does and to Padre Soto. Give him my regards and tell him",1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,4,8,0,11,21,0,2,1,14,2,12,13,9,1,2,3,1,2,2,1
"974",1579,56,"that I think he is more of a friend through deeds than through words, for he has never written to me or even sent greetings.
6. I don't know why you say that Padre Fray Nicolao has turned me against you, for you have no greater defender on earth. He was telling me the truth so that by being informed of the damage done in that house I would not be deceived. Oh, my daughter, how useless it is to excuse yourself so much in what regards me! I tell you truly, I don't care whether they pay any attention to me or not if I know they are striving to do what they are obliged to do. The mistake comes from the fact that since with so much care and love I think I am looking out for what concerns the nuns, it seems to me that they won't do what they ought if they don't pay attention to me and that I have tired myself in vain. And this is what got me annoyed, to the extent that I wanted to abandon the whole thing, thinking, as I say, I was doing no good, as is true. But my love is so great that as soon as I see some little fruit I am unable to give up, and so there is no more to say about this.
7. Serrano has told me that a nun has now been accepted and that according to the number of nuns he thinks there are in the house -- he tells me twenty -- the number is complete. If it is, no one can give permission for her to be accepted, for Father Vicar can do nothing against the acts of the apostolic visitators. Consider carefully, for the love of God, that you would be amazed at the harm that comes to these houses from there being many nuns, even though there may be an income and enough food. I don't know why you pay so much interest every year since you have the means of freeing yourself of this obligation. I was delighted over what is coming from the Indies. May God be praised.
8. As for what you say about the subprioress, since your health is so poor and you cannot keep up with the choir observance, you need someone who knows it very well. That Gabriela seems so young matters little. She has been a nun for a long while, and her virtues are what matter.

And she is healthy -- since it is necessary that she not be missing from choir -- and San Jerónimo is not. In conscience, she is the one I think most suited. And since she was in charge of the choir during the time of that miserable vicaress, they will have seen that she did well and more willingly give her their vote; and for a subprioress, you look more to one's ability than to one's age.
9. I am writing to the prior of Pastrana about the mistress of novices since what you say seems good to me. I would like the novices to be few in number, for a large number of nuns, as I said, is in every respect, a great drawback, and there is no other reason than this for houses to come to ruin.
10. I would greatly desire -- since down there you have the means to help the order in its needs -- that from what is in Toledo you gradually reimburse my brother. He is truly in need, in such a way that he has had to borrow in order to pay the five hundred ducats each year for the property he bought; and now he has sold objects that in Seville would be worth a thousand ducats. He has mentioned this to me at times, and I see that he is right. Although you don't do so all at once, you can pay something; see what you can do.
11. The alms of bread that the prior of Las Cuevas gives is great. If this house here had as much they could get along well, for I don't know what they will do. They have done nothing but take in nuns without dowries. As for what you say about Portugal, the archbishop is in a hurry. I am thinking of taking my time about going there. If I can, I will write to him now. Will you see that the letter leaves at once and in a safe manner.
12. Regarding the repentance of Beatriz, I would like her, for the good of her soul, to retract what she said to Garciálvarez. But I have a great fear that she doesn't know herself; only God can bring this about.
13. May he make you as holy as I beg of him and watch over you for me. However wretched you are,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,7,5,0,6,12,2,0,3,7,7,11,6,4,6,6,0,0,3,0,1
"976",1579,58,"I would like to have some more like you, for I wouldn't know what to do if I had to make a foundation now. I don't find any prospective prioresses, although there might be some. Yet because these lack experience and I see what has gone on here, I have become very fearful, knowing that the devil can make use of good intentions to carry out his own works. So it is necessary to walk always with fear clinging to God and with little trust in our own opinions. However good they may be, if this care is not present, God will abandon us, and we will make a mistake in the very thing we were more sure of.
14. You can learn from what happened in this house, since you have already heard about it. I tell you that certainly the devil was planning an assault and that I was frightened by some of the things you wrote and gave importance to. Where was your good sense? And then San Francisco! Oh, God help me, the foolishness contained in that letter, and all so as to achieve your goal! May the Lord give us light, for without that light there is no virtue but only the ability to do wrong.
15. I am happy that you are so disillusioned, for this will help you with many things. In order to succeed it is beneficial to have erred, for in that way you acquire experience.
May God watch over you, for I did not think I could go on at such length.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
The prioress and the sisters send their best regards. To the very magnificent Señor Alonso Alvarez Ramírez, my lord.
1. Jesus be with your honor. If I had as much time at my disposal as you, I wouldn't be negligent about writing, as you are. But I do not neglect to recommend you to the Lord. Since I have learned about your health from other sources, I can bear with your silence. May our Lord grant you health, as is in his power and as I desire, so that you and Señor Diego Ortiz and Señora Francisca Ramírez may rejoice in that most precious work, which as I am told, is now the church with its chaplains. May God be praised forever.
2. I rejoiced over the pleasant manner in which our most Reverend General brought the matter to a conclusion. He is a wise and holy man. May God preserve him. His Majesty knows how willingly I",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,1,0,18,0,12,21,3,1,3,10,11,10,19,6,2,2,0,0,2,0,0
"977",1579,59,"would have remained in our monastery in Toledo. Ever since I left it, I tell you that I have not had a day without heavy trials. Two monasteries have been founded, glory to God, and this house is the smaller one. May it please His Majesty that it be of some service to him.
3. I don't know why the body of Señor Martín Ramírez -- may he be in glory as I desire and beg the Lord -- has not been transferred. I beg you to let me know why, and if any progress has been made in the project you once mentioned to me. O Lord! How often have I remembered you in the business affairs that have arisen here and how many times I have asked for blessings on you. For it was enough to say something once to you all, even in jest, for something to get done. May our Lord keep you for many years and allow me to enjoy your presence, for I certainly love you in the Lord.
4. It would be good if Señor Diego Ortiz were to write to me now and then. When you do not want to write, tell him to write for you. I kiss your hands many times and those of Señora Francisca Ramírez; and my regards to our little angels. May our Lord guard them, especially our patron, and may he keep you in his hands and give you all of the good I beseech him to bestow on you, amen.
Today is 5 February.
5. I forgot to mention that Juan de Ovalle and my sister kiss your hands. Juan de Ovalle never finishes speaking of what he owes you; and what must I owe!
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
6. About the favor you have done me in lavishing so much attention on Isabel de San Pablo, I am saying nothing. I owe you so much in return that I am leaving it to the Lord to thank and repay you. You have done a great charity. May the Lord be blessed for everything. Tell Señor Diego Ortiz that I beg him not to fail to place my lord St. Joseph at the door of the church. I tell you that I find here a wonderful leisure that I have desired for many years. Although one's nature feels abandoned without the one who usually provides it with solace, the soul is at rest. And the reason is that there is no more thought of Teresa of",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,5,18,0,2,18,0,0,2,8,9,8,17,7,0,3,5,4,0,3,0
"978",1579,60,"Jesus than if she were not in the world. And this will be the cause for my not making any attempt to leave here, unless I am ordered to do so. I was disheartened at times to hear so much foolishness; for when they say there that someone is a saint, it's bound to be nonsense. They laugh because I say they should declare someone else in that place to be one, for it doesn't cost them any more than words. 1. I tell you -- and for the love of God always be attentive to this if you do not want to see your house lost -- that the price of things is so increasing that a house needs close to 300,000 maravedis in income when it is not a house of poverty. With the amount actually being given, the nuns in this house -- which will then acquire the reputation of receiving an income -- will starve to death; no doubt about it.
2. You should realize that if it depended on me I would not want to see any of the houses now founded in poverty to have an income. For I understand and see it now, and it will always be so: the communities that do not fail God will prosper most. If they fail him, it's better that they come to naught, for there are too many relaxed monasteries.
3. May God pardon those who opposed the foundations, for these foundations were a means for setting things right. And since the foundations were not well established, this opposition did much harm. His Majesty will provide a remedy; nothing short of this is possible. But until then, you must proceed very cautiously when giving permission to receive nuns. This should be done only if there is great need and it would be beneficial for the house. The well-being of a house requires that there be no more nuns than can be maintained. If careful attention is not paid to this, we will end up with unsolvable problems ...
4. It would be better not to make a foundation than to bring in melancholic nuns who will ruin the house. Daughter, Father John of the Cross is going there. Let the nuns in that monastery speak to him of matters concerning their souls with simplicity as though they were speaking with me, for he has the spirit of our Lord. 1. O life, life! How can you endure being separated from your Life? In so much solitude, with",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,8,8,15,1,10,10,1,0,6,5,12,18,16,3,3,5,0,0,3,1,1
"980",1580,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. A short time ago I received a letter from Señora Doña Juana who awaits daily an end to the silence imposed on you. Please God that when this letter arrives the matters in Toledo and Medina will be taken care of.
2. Padre Fray Felipe fits perfectly. He has gone to the other extreme, not engaging in talk outside of confession. He is a very good man.
3. Oh, the rejoicing of the nuns in Medina when they were told you were no longer obliged to be silent. It's amazing, what you owe those nuns. A lay sister here has taken a hundred disciplines for you. It all should be of benefit to you in doing good for souls.
4. Yesterday they gave me this letter from Padre Nicolao. I was delighted that what he mentions can be done. At times I was worried about the Salamanca matter, but I didn't see any better thing, and now he has a great deal to attend to. Certainly he has to attend more to his own affairs than to those of others. I told Padre Nicolao in Toledo something about the disadvantages but not everything I know. A great good came out of this. I believe the Most Reverend Vicar General will do everything to improve our situation. Only one doubt remains, and it is that when the nuncio died, as you know, the powers that he had given were no longer considered valid. It would be a great trial to have to listen to different opinions in a matter so important. Tell me what you think, for I don't see any other obstacle. On the contrary, it would seem to be a gift from heaven if among ourselves we could organize everything, as he says there. May the Lord bring this about, as he can.
5. If everything does not come about as we desire, I wonder what good it is for Padre Nicolao to be waiting down there; our cause would be left abandoned. True, Velasco will do much, but nothing will be lost by his having help. Don't speak of this, however, lest they accuse you, when they do what they say they will, that you acted out of self-interest. It is necessary to proceed with caution in everything so as to remove any occasion for false accusations, especially while Methuselah continues in office. He strongly opposes me as regards Paul having an office; but one has to put",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,10,1,5,22,2,0,3,8,1,8,11,10,2,6,0,0,0,0,0
"981",1580,2,"up with that.
6. Another drawback comes to mind now: I am wondering whether you could be provincial while remaining in that other office. Although I don't think this is a question of great importance, it would amount to your having it all, and it would be good if Macario could be appointed provincial. And we would put an end to his discontent so that he could die in peace, since the desire to be provincial is at the root of his melancholy; and this little clique will end. And this could be a reasonable thing to do since he had been appointed before. By his having a superior he couldn't do any harm. Tell me, for goodness' sake, what you think about this, for it is a matter concerning the future; but even if it involved the present, there's no reason to be scrupulous about it.
7. In the enclosed letter from Fray Gabriel you will see the temptation he undergoes in my regard; yet I have not failed to write to him when I had a carrier. And notice what jealousy does, for he says there that from the letters of mine you have sent him he sees that I have not written him. I will be delighted when this letter arrives if that matter concerning you will have ended so that you can write to me at length.
8. I forgot to mention the duke and duchess. You should know that on New Year's Eve the duchess sent me a courier with the enclosed letter, and another one, only so as to have news of me. In what she says about you telling her that I cared more for the duke, I did not agree. I said that since you told me so many good things about him including the fact that he was a spiritual man, you must have misunderstood my response. But I added that only God did I love for himself and that I didn't see anything in her that would be a reason for my not loving her and that I owed her more love than I did the duke. I said it in a better way than this.
9. I think that book of which you say Padre Medina had a copy made is my long one. Tell me what you know about this. Don't forget for I would be very happy if it were not lost; there is no other copy but the one the angels have. In my opinion the one I",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,3,1,5,15,0,1,3,12,9,17,9,3,3,5,0,0,0,2,0
"982",1580,3,"wrote afterward is superior, even though Fray Domingo says it's not good; at least I had more experience at the time I wrote it.
10. I have already written to the duke twice and at greater length than you tell me to.
11. May God preserve you, for if something now were to make me happy, it would be to see Paul. If God doesn't will it, well and good; let him give me cross upon cross.
Beatriz sends her best regards.
Your unworthy servant and true daughter,
Teresa of Jesus To mi padre, Fray Nicolao de Jesús María, prior of Pastrana, Seville.
1. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. Three or four days ago I received your letter dated 30 December, and previously I had received the ones Serrano brought. I answered you at length and also Mother Prioress, and I also wrote to Padre Rodrigo Alvarez. I gave these letters to Serrano and he attended to them, and afterward they told me that the letters were certainly given to the carrier. Apart from those, after I arrived here, I wrote you two other times and sent the letters to Señor Oria to send to you. Truly, I was disappointed to see that they were all lost. Please God that won't happen to this one, for I am sending it through Velasco.
2. You submit in everything to the Mother Prioress there, but she doesn't say a word to me. Since she is well, I believe that she will establish good order in everything else, especially with such a steward. What doesn't loving God bring about, since that steward wants to favor those poor souls! I earnestly beg him for prayers. Why don't you tell me anything about our Lucrecia? Give her my warmest greetings.
3. Before I forget, the prioress of Beas informed Casademonte in a message that she had the one hundred ducats and asked where he wanted her to send them. He said Madrid. I have already written you about this. So there's no need to worry about it.
4. You should realize that this place is so out of the way that you cannot count on my informing you of anything, as if I were in Seville, where I would be able to do much better; and even were I to send letters through Toledo, there are few messengers who go there; and these letters I also find get lost. I say this because you ask me to let you know when it will be necessary for you",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,9,0,4,17,1,0,3,7,5,9,9,7,2,4,1,0,0,0,0
"983",1580,4,"to come and about what is happening.
5. I informed Velasco not to count on me as long as I am here. And if you stay in Seville a long while, it could happen that you will not find me here, for I think the foundation of nuns in Villanueva -- which is near La Roda -- will be made and that it will be possible for me to go with the nuns. For if anywhere there is need of my presence, it's there. Padre Fray Antonio and the prior have been making such a fuss about this and insisting that it is the least we can do, our Lord must want it. I still don't know for certain; but if it is to be, I will leave before Lent. I regret not speaking with you, for I thought I would have that relief in Malagón.
6. My health is good, and, as for this house, everything is going so well that I cannot thank God enough for my having come. Spiritually, the community is doing very well and with much peace and contentment; in temporal matters it is improving, for it was a lost cause. May God be blessed for everything.
7. What you say about the most Reverend vicar general pleased me so much that I wanted to see it already done, and so I wrote about it to Velasco and to the caveman. I have only pointed out that there should be no doubt concerning the validity of this substitution, for when the nuncio died there were various opinions as to whether the commission he had given to Padre Gracián was still valid or not, and we are tired of conflicts. And so, whether yes or no, it would be good -- if God grants us the grace of a good outcome -- to hurry to do what is fitting while the person this mainly concerns is still alive. All the reasons you give me seem to be very good, and go beyond what I understand. So, we must not delay in this.
8. If you remain down there, we could be left in need of you if everything doesn't go according to our plan. I am writing this to Velasco and will submit to his opinion. In this regard, if it were not for the hardship it would cause you, since it is not easy to come up here so quickly, I would consider it preferable that you come, even though you would then have to go back",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,8,2,3,17,1,0,2,10,8,23,18,7,1,2,0,0,3,0,0
"984",1580,5,"down there. Although it is true that if Velasco is in Madrid, your presence might not be needed -- and I wrote this to him -- it is very important that the two of you be able to discuss things together. Something could happen in which your absence would result in serious harm, or at least in your being very sorry you weren't there, even though our friends love us very much. And even though our Padre Gracián is free, it would not be appropriate for him to become involved in these matters; if afterward our plan is realized, they will say that he was acting in his own interests. And although this does not matter much, it is good to avoid being the occasion for such judgments.
9. I have thought that if the caveman is not to be provincial and if he is given that other office, it would be good to elect Fray Antonio de Jesús. He has been chosen for the office before and will certainly do well if he has a superior over him -- he demonstrated this when the one from Salamanca entrusted that task to him -- and especially if he has a good companion. And we would be putting an end to this temptation and also to this little clique -- if there is one -- for that would be a much greater evil than any deficiency there might be should he become provincial. I say this now because I don't know when I will be able to write you again, considering the ill-fortune these letters can run into. I have recommended the greatest care with this one.
10. I would like to know how this discord that has now arisen began. Please God they will put an end to it down there. And may he watch over you. I am tired, for I have written much. Although my health is better here than it usually was when I was down there, my head never leaves me alone.
11. If the prior of Almodóvar is there, give him my best regards and tell him I am doing much for his friends. From each one I have accepted a nun, and please God he will be grateful to me. One was sent by Juan Vasquez; and the one who left Beas, by Cantalapiedra. I am told his reverence has a very good opinion of her.
12. The prioress asks for your prayers. All the nuns, especially myself, recommend you to our Lord, for I never",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,7,0,6,23,1,1,1,8,3,17,16,5,1,2,0,1,2,1,0
"985",1580,6,"forget you. I don't fail to have some suspicion that you would be delighted with any opportunity there is for you to remain in Seville. If it is a rash judgment, may God forgive me. May His Majesty make you very holy and keep you for many years, amen.
Today is 13 January.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with you, my sisters and daughters. I was greatly consoled by the lines you wrote and would like to respond to each one at length. But my duties prevent me from finding the time to do this. So may you pardon me and accept my good will. It would be a great consolation for me to know those who have made profession and those who have just entered. Congratulations to you in being espoused to so great a King. May it please His Majesty to make you the kind of nuns I both desire and beg of him so that in that eternity that has no end you may rejoice with him.
2. To Sister Jerónima, who signed her name as ""dungheap,"" I say, please God this humility will amount to more than words; and to Sister Gabriela, that I received the St. Paul, which was very beautiful and in being so small resembled her and pleased me very much. I hope God will make her large in her obedience. In truth it seems His Majesty wants to make you all better than the nuns here -- since he has given you such great trials -- unless you lose out through your own fault. May he be praised for everything, especially for the good choice made in your elections. It has been a great consolation for me.
3. Here we find through experience that the Lord seems to give the first superior he appoints for a foundation more help and more love for the benefit of the house and of the sisters than to those who come afterward, and so they succeed in helping souls make progress. In my opinion, as long as there is nothing seriously wrong in the conduct of the one who is the first superior in these houses, she should not be changed, for there are more disadvantages in this than the nuns may suppose. May the Lord enlighten you that you may be certain of doing his will in everything, amen.
4. I beg Sister Beatriz de la Madre de Dios and Sister Margarita to do what previously I asked",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,4,1,2,0,17,0,7,27,1,0,3,10,11,8,17,5,1,1,0,1,0,1,0
"986",1580,7,"of all the nuns, that they no longer speak of the things of the past except to our Lord, or with their confessor. If they were deceived in some way, giving out information without that simplicity and charity we are obliged to by God, they should make every effort to return to speaking clearly and truthfully. Where satisfaction is called for, they should render it; if they don't, they will go about disturbed; the devil will not stop tempting them.
5. Let them just please the Lord; there is no reason to pay any more attention to the matter. The devil has gone about in a very angry way, seeking to prevent those holy beginnings from going forward. There is no basis for being surprised except by all the great harm that he has not caused everywhere. Often the Lord allows a fall so that the soul will be more humble, and when it returns to the right way of acting and grows in self-knowledge, it advances further in the service of our Lord, as we see among many saints. So, my daughters, you are all daughters and sisters of the Blessed Virgin and should try to love one another and take care to behave as though nothing happened. I am speaking to each one of you.
6. I have taken particular care to pray to the Lord for those who think I am angry with them. Certainly, I was saddened, but I will be more so if they don't do what I am saying here, which I beg them to do for the love of our Lord. I always keep my dear Sister Juana de la Cruz very much in mind. I imagine she is continually gaining merit. And since she has taken the title ""of the Cross,"" she has received a good share of it. May she pray to our Lord for me and believe that it was neither on account of her sins nor mine, which are much greater, that he imposed this penance on all the nuns.
7. I ask the same of all of you, not to forget me in your prayers, for you owe me more than do the nuns here.
May our Lord make you as holy as I desire, amen.
Your servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor, my sister. I tell you that if I were to go about looking for my own satisfaction, I would consider it a trial that we are always so separated. Since, however,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,4,30,0,8,19,1,2,1,8,8,9,11,11,2,4,0,0,0,3,0
"987",1580,8,"we are in a land of exile, we will have to endure it until our Lord brings us to the place that will last forever.
2. In a letter I wrote to my brother a short time ago, I wrote to you that the fever is gone, glory to God. I sent the letter to Mother Prioress in Medina. Certainly, since I have been in this region, I've found it painful not to know a messenger through whom I could send you a word from time to time. I was feeling very sorry about this when the Señor Licentiate, who is sending this for me, told me that I could have done this often if I had given the letters to him. But I just got to know him now when I accepted a sister-in-law of his for one of our houses. In any case, answer me soon, for here they will forward the letter to me wherever I may be.
3. I am leaving, God willing, on Ash Wednesday. I will be in Medina for eight days -- for I cannot delay -- nor do I even know if it will be that long; then another eight days in Avila. I'll be greatly consoled to see you there even if for only one day ... 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. Seeing that I have a messenger as reliable as this brother, I did not want to miss a chance to write these lines even though I wrote you at length yesterday through Juan Vázquez, the one from Almodóvar.
2. Fray Antonio de la Madre de Dios was here and he preached three sermons that pleased me greatly. He seems to be a fine man. It gives me great consolation when I see persons like this among our friars. And I grieved over the death of the good Fray Francisco. May he be with God in heaven.
3. Oh, mi padre, how worried I am, if this foundation in Villanueva is made, that I won't find a prioress or nuns who will satisfy me! This San Angel from here seems to have some good qualities, as I wrote you, but since she was formed amid the liberties taken in this house, I am very fearful. Tell me what you think. And her health is very poor. Beatriz doesn't seem to me to have the qualities that I am looking for, although she has kept this house peaceful. Now that I have got over my worries",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,11,2,7,13,3,0,2,12,5,7,16,2,4,0,1,0,3,0,0
"988",1580,9,"about the house here, I find myself weighed down with concerns about another one.
4. As for Arenas, I think the Flemish nun, who is very calm after having provided for her daughters, will be good, and she has fine qualities. If God should will that the foundation in Madrid become a reality, I have Inés de Jesús. Recommend all of this to His Majesty, for it is very important to start off right; and tell me what you think, for goodness' sake.
May our Lord preserve you with the holiness I beg of him, amen. Today is 15 January.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter and subject.
Teresa of Jesus For my sister, María de Jesús, Carmelite.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your charity, my daughter. If you had my headache and so many business matters to deal with, you would be excused for not having written me in so long a time. But since you are without these, I don't know why you leave me to complain about you and my dear Sister Catalina de Jesús. Well, certainly you ought not to do this! If I could, I would be writing to you so frequently that I wouldn't allow you to sleep in forgetting me so much. It is a comfort to me to know that you are in good health and happy and that, according to what they say, serving our Lord.
2. May it please His Majesty that this be so, for I beg it of him. In the thought of that house I would now like to find comfort after the many tiresome problems and trials of such diverse kinds that I have gone through in these past years. This desire corresponds to my sensual nature. But when reason returns, I see well that I do not deserve anything but the cross and more of the cross and that God is doing me a great favor in not giving me anything else.
3. Your Mother Prioress will have already told you how they are ordering me to go to a place to make a foundation there, something I have been resisting for years. Well they have persevered so long -- and it seems a good thing to our superior -- that I am now going, very confident that it will be of service to our Lord. Will you ask this of him and that he will always allow me to do his will.

May His Majesty make you as holy as I desire.
Your charity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus To the magnificent Señor Diego Ortiz, my lord.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be ever in your soul and repay you for the charity and favor you have shown me with your letter. You would not be losing time if you wrote me many, for this could help to spur us on in the service of the Lord. His Majesty knows that I would rather be down there, and so I'm in a great hurry to purchase a house here. It's a weighty burden, although there are many for sale and at a low price. So I hope in the Lord this matter will be settled soon. My haste is equal to the joy that will be mine in seeing Señor Alonso Ramírez. I kiss his honor's hands and those of Señora Doña Francisca Ramírez.
2. Surely your honors must find great joy in your church, for I share in your happiness through the good news I receive. May our Lord allow you to enjoy many years with as much dedication to his service as I beg of him. Allow His Majesty to work and do not be in such a hurry to see everything done, for he has already granted us a great favor in what has been accomplished in just two years.
3. I don't understand what has been written to me about the controversy with the curate and chaplains -- at Santa Justa I suppose. I beg you to let me know what this is all about.
4. I am not writing to his honor Señor Alonso Ramírez; there's no reason for tiring him, since I'm writing to you. Because I am not able to serve your honors in the way I ought, I beg the Lord to repay and to preserve you for many years and to make those angels very holy -- especially my patron -- for we are in great need of this; and may he always keep you in his care, amen.
Today is 29 March.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite For Mother Prioress of San José in Seville, Carmelite.

"990",1580,11,"be with your reverence, my daughter. Today, on the vigil of Our Lady of the Transfiguration, I received your letter and the ones from those sisters of mine. I was most delighted. I don't know why it is that despite all the displeasure you cause me I cannot help but love you much. I soon get over it all. And now since your house has gained through the suffering of those conflicts, I love you more. Praise God, for everything turned out so well, and you must be somewhat better, for the nuns no longer shed tears over you as they usually do.
2. To wear the tunic in summer is foolish. If you want to please me, take if off when this letter arrives however great a means of mortification it is. Since all the sisters know of your need, they will not be disedified. You will be fulfilling your duty before the Lord, since you are doing this for me. And don't do anything else, for I have experienced the heat there. And it is better for the nuns to be able to attend the community acts than for them all to be sick. What I say to you applies also to any others you see have a need.
3. I have given praise to our Lord that the election went so well, for they say that when it goes like this the Holy Spirit is intervening. Rejoice in this suffering and don't allow the devil to disturb you with unhappiness over the office. It's funny that you now say you would be delighted to know I am praying for you. It has been a year since not only I but all the monasteries at my request have been doing so, and this is why perhaps everything has gone so well. May it please His Majesty to continue his work.
4. I already knew that with the arrival of Padre Fray Nicolao everything would be done very well. But a little before your request for him and before he received orders to leave, you were spoiling everything for us. For you were looking out only for your own house, and he was busy with the affairs of the whole order, which depended on him. God has provided in accord with who he is. I would have liked Fray Nicolao to be there and also here until I saw a final conclusion to a matter so important. I would have greatly desired that he come at a time when we",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,13,0,7,19,1,0,4,6,9,11,10,10,3,3,0,1,1,2,0
"991",1580,12,"could have talked. Now this cannot be, for you know that five days ago Father Vicar sent a patent letter for me to go to Villanueva de la Jara, which is near La Roda, to found a monastery. For almost four years, both the city council from there and other persons, especially the inquisitor of Cuenca, who is there as public prosecutor, have been pressing us to do so. I was finding many reasons against making the foundation. Padre Fray Antonio de Jesús and the prior of La Roda went there. The promoters of the foundation so insisted that they got what they wanted. The distance is twenty-eight leagues from here.
5. I would consider it a very fortunate thing if I could go by way of Seville so as to see you and satisfy my desire to argue with you; or, to put it better, to speak with you, for now after the trials you've gone through you must have become more mature. I have to return here before Easter, God willing, for my permission lasts only until the feast of St. Joseph. Tell Father Prior so that if that place is on his way he can stop to see me.
6. I have written to him by way of Madrid, and I would have written to him, and to you, more often, but since I thought the letters would be lost, I didn't dare. I am delighted that mine were not lost because in one of them I wrote what I thought about the choice of a subprioress, although you know better than I what is fitting for your house. But I tell you it is absurd to have both a prioress and a subprioress with poor health, just as it would be also to have a subprioress who cannot read well or preside over the choir, something contrary to the constitutions. Who is preventing you when you are occupied in some other business from appointing in your place whomever you desire? And should you be very sick I don't think Gabriela would deviate from what you tell her. And if you give authority to her and your approval, she has the virtue not to give a bad example, and so I am glad to see you are inclined toward her. May God ordain what is best.
7. I was amused by what you said about not believing everything that San Jerónimo says, after I had written the same thing to you so often. And even in a letter",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,1,2,3,0,4,9,0,1,2,12,6,15,11,2,3,4,0,0,2,0,0
"992",1580,13,"addressed to Garciálvarez, which you tore up, I said a great deal lest one give credence to what she says about her spiritual life. Nonetheless, I say that she is a good soul and as long as she does not go astray, there is no reason to compare her with Beatriz; for she errs through a lack of understanding, not out of malice. Now it can be that I am mistaken. If you do not allow her to confess except with the friars of the order, an end will be put to the matter. And if at times she confesses to Rodrigálvarez, tell him my opinion and always give him my best regards.
8. I was glad to see by these letters written to me by the sisters their love for you, and I thought the letters were just fine. In a certain sense reading them was recreation for me; and I was delighted with your letter. If only my displeasure with San Francisco would go away. I believe it is because her letter seemed to me to show little humility and obedience. For this reason you should look after her progress -- for some of the things from Paterna must be sticking to her -- and don't allow her to exaggerate so much. Even though with her circumlocutions she thinks she is not lying, it is far from the demands of perfection to use such a style when she speaks with someone to whom she should speak clearly and by doing so prevent a superior from committing a thousand follies. Tell her this in response to the letter she wrote me and that when she corrects her manner I will be satisfied. I want us to please this great God, for little attention should be paid to me.
9. Oh, my daughter, if I had the time and head to tell at length all the things that have gone on in this house so that you could gain experience and even ask God pardon for not having kept me informed. I have learned that you witnessed some things that I would dare wager have not taken place in any of the very lax monasteries in all Spain. A good intention could have excused some; for others it was not enough. May you learn a lesson from this and keep close to the constitutions -- since you are so fond of them -- if you do not want to end up gaining little from the world and losing out with",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,2,7,0,3,15,0,1,1,15,10,17,13,9,2,5,0,1,1,1,0
"993",1580,14,"God.
10. There are not any nuns now who do not realize what danger they were walking in, and they say so, except Beatriz de Jesús, who so loved the sisters that despite the evidence she never informed me; nor does she say anything to me now about it. She has lost much in my esteem.
11. Since I have come, the one who served as confessor no longer does so, nor do I think he ever will. This is what the town needs, for the whole thing was awful, and certainly he would do well if he were subject to another. May God pardon the one who caused him to harm this house, for he could have benefitted and all the nuns with him. He understands well that there is a reason for what is being done. He comes to see me, and I have been most gracious to him -- for that is what is necessary now -- and I feel at ease with his simplicity. A lack of age and experience does much harm. Oh, mi madre, the world is so malicious that it doesn't find good in anything! If with the experience we have had we are not careful, everything will go from bad to worse. You should now look as carefully at everything as an old woman -- since you have received a share in so many trials for love of our Lord -- and I will do the same.
12. I have noticed that you have not sent me any carols, for certainly there are quite a few to choose from. I like to see joy in your house, with moderation, for if I said something, it was for certain situations. My Gabriela is to blame for this. Give her my best regards; I would really like to write to her. I am bringing Sant Angel for subprioress, and the prioress will come from Toledo, although I have not decided who this will be. Pray much to the Lord that this foundation will be of service to him. And I entrust Beatriz to you, for she must be pitied. I am happy with the message from Margarita, may she continue in this spirit. Time will smooth things over as they see the love you have for them.
13. I am amazed at what we owe the good Father Prior of Las Cuevas. Give him my warmest regards. Ask all the nuns to pray to the Lord for me, and you do the same, for I am",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,13,0,9,23,0,2,2,11,5,10,12,11,4,3,3,0,0,3,0

14. I am not telling you about the responses of Mother Prioress and Beatriz because I am very tired.
15. You should know that my brother has written two letters to me here. He tells me to write to you about his need -- he thinks it is greater than yours -- and that you would be doing him a real favor if you gave him now even a half of what you owe him. I gave the letters to someone here to keep so I could send them to you. Now they cannot find them. You would understand in reading them that I would not be urging you if he himself were not. You should know that he has used up a good part of the rent that you are giving him and that anything you send would be a help to him now. I would have given him something here, but these business matters take up everything.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
16. From the length of this, you will see how much I was desiring to write to you. It is four times the length of those I send to the prioresses up here, and seldom do I write them in my own hand. I was delighted by the good order into which Father Prior put your financial affairs. With regard to what you owe my brother, do not do yourselves harm, even though we are in need. Here all the nuns are very happy, and with such a prioress they have every reason to be. I tell you that she is among the best we have in all our houses, and her health is good, which is an important thing. The house is like a paradise. With regard to the financial loss, I have set up a plan by which they can earn enough to survive. Please God it will help; at least nothing will be lost because of the prioress, for she is a great administrator.
17. Many greetings to Padre Fray Gregorio, ask why he has forgotten me; and to Padre Soto, whose friendship has been very helpful to you.

The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Although I wrote to you a few times recently, I would do so more often if I had a messenger. Since I don't know whether I will have one in Villanueva, I am writing this.
2. I thought we would be gone by now, although they are not late in coming for us. It bothers me to be traveling during Lent.
3. I was delighted with what the prioress of Seville writes about paying what they owe you. She says that almost four hundred ducats will soon be delivered, as you will see from the small paper enclosed. Since the letters have so far to go, I didn't dare send them all. I received two letters from you in which you directed me to ask her for the money. My letter in which I mentioned this to her must have arrived before I wrote to her again. I already told her that you would be satisfied with even half the amount and that if you knew they were in need, you would endure your own without asking them for anything. I don't know if it wouldn't be better that the money remain down there, for you always said you wanted it for the chapel, and now you won't do anything but spend it all. May God direct things; since you want it for him, may you make a profit on the livestock.
4. As I said in the other letters, I am feeling better than I did in Avila, although not without the usual ailments.
5. Soon Padre Nicolao will be back in those parts; you may write to him, for he will be closer than I. When I know he is in Pastrana, I will arrange that he give you that money. The prioress in Toledo is charged with collecting the money that is there. Now I am writing her that on collecting it she give it to you.
6. They are doing well in Seville. From the elderly woman who died in the Indies, they inherited eight hundred ducats which they have now received.

Today is ... February.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your paternity. You should know that today Padre Fray Ambrosio, prior of Almodóvar, has come and is hoping to speak to Fray Gabriel, who will be the one to come for us. Certainly, mi padre, he has seemed to me to be an upright and intelligent man. I do not say this because I spoke openly with him about anything small or great; rather I proceeded with great caution in everything, with a yes or a no. But I say I am delighted to know that these factions -- if there ever were any -- thought to be still in existence, have broken apart. Regarding Fray John of the Cross I can swear that nothing of the sort ever entered his mind, rather he helped the friars in Rome as much as he could, and he would die, if necessary, for you. This is the absolute truth.
2. This Fray Ambrosio has great zeal for the good of the order, and so I don't think he will do anything he shouldn't. He comes from Seville and has seen what is going on there, and Padre Nicolao had no small thing to put up with from those people ...
3. I found my Isabel getting a little chubby, and her color was something to praise God for. Those who are in Madrid are also well, and your sister Señora Doña Juana, too, as I recently learned.
4. Don't neglect to send me the permission for Antonio Gaytán's daughter.
5. Of course, I am annoyed at Padre Mariano for not sending me the documents you sent for me; may God pardon him.
6. The prioress and all the nuns recommend themselves to your prayers ...
7. May the Lord watch over you, and for your goodness toward us give you what most befits you as well as an abundance of grace in the midst of so much turmoil, amen.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. Today Padre Fray Antonio and Father Prior have come from La Roda to get us. They have a coach and a wagon, and from the news",0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,4,13,1,6,23,1,1,3,7,2,9,15,9,3,4,1,1,0,1,0
"997",1580,18,"they are reporting, I think the foundation will turn out well. Pray to our Lord for this. The good Fray Antonio cannot deny his love for me, since despite his old age he now comes here. I don't like having to go so far; I have already written to you about the reason. Padre Fray Antonio looks well and has gained weight. It seems to me that this year's trials are causing our friars to gain weight.
2. Tell Señor Velasco that I received his letters and would like to respond to them. I don't know if I will have time because I am very busy.
3. May God reward him for obtaining for us the freedom to be able to communicate with you. Together with all the nuns, I pray much to our Lord for him. I would love to know who got this blessing for us and if between himself and Señor Don Luis Manrique a plan could be worked out for obtaining permission from the archbishop to found a monastery in Madrid. On my return from this foundation, I could make a foundation there very quickly without anyone knowing about it until it was done, for I already have someone who will provide the funds for the house. And if the archbishop wants the house to have an income, you already know that Luis Guillamas's daughters are going to enter soon. They will be receiving 400,000 maravedis each year, which for thirteen nuns is enough. Father Vicar will give me the permission right away. Perhaps those gentlemen will know some friend of the archbishop's who might obtain it for us.
4. If you think it opportune, do not fail to take up this matter so that we know whether the answer is yes or no. If by chance the foundation can be made, you must let me know at once. Find someone with whom you can send me letters so that I can keep informed about your health. May our Lord grant it to you, as he can and as I beg of him. Today is 12 February.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus For Madre María de San José, prioress of the discalced Carmelite nuns.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. You can well believe that I would be happy to be in a condition to write you a long letter, but my health has been poor these days. It seems I am paying for having been well in",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,4,15,0,1,16,0,0,1,17,10,12,19,2,1,0,2,0,2,2,2
"998",1580,19,"Malagón and Villanueva and along the roads. Not for many days or even years, I believe, had my health been so good. It was a great favor from our Lord, so now it doesn't matter that I'm not well.
2. Since Holy Thursday I have had one of the worst attacks ever of paralysis and heart pains. I've had a fever up until now -- which still hasn't left -- and I am in such a state of weakness that I accomplished a great deal in managing to stay at the grille with Padre Nicolao, who has been here two days now and whose presence made me happy. At least you were not forgotten. I am amazed at how you have fooled him. I am helping you in that, for I see that this won't be a bad thing for that house. What is worse is that it seems his illusion is sticking to me. May it please God, my daughter, that you don't do anything to disillusion him, and may the Lord be your guide. I was very happy about the good things you told me concerning those sisters. I would very much like to meet them. Tell them that and give them my regards and ask them to pray for the negotiations going on over Portugal and that Doña Guiomar may have children. It is a pity to see the state the mother and daughter are in because she doesn't have any. Take this very much to heart, for you owe it to her. She is a very good Christian, but this trial is costing them both dearly.
3. I have received some letters from you, although the one that Father Prior of Pastrana brought is the longest. I am delighted that he has left the affairs of that house in such a good state, and now with Padre Gracián going there you will not lack anything. Make sure, my daughter -- there may be someone who will exaggerate what you are doing -- that you avoid occasions for criticism. In truth, I believe that he is well aware of this.
4. I was startled by some of the things Padre Nicolao told me. Today he gave me the reports, which I will read little by little. That soul frightens me. May God provide a remedy. The plan for dealing with her that he gave you seems fine to me. Don't get careless about the other nun either.
5. He told me how generous you were in contributing toward the",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,1,2,2,9,0,14,22,3,2,2,5,6,2,14,3,2,0,0,2,5,0,0
"999",1580,20,"cost of the negotiations for the order. God reward you, for I did not know what more to do here. Mostly everything is done. They are expecting the official communication to come any day, for it has arrived there, and the news is very good. All of you thank our Lord. Because Father Prior will write at length, I am not saying anything more about this.
6. Regarding that house they are selling you, he praised it highly to me, and also for having an orchard and views. In our manner of life, this is an important matter, especially because of the income you are going to have. That it is so far from Los Remedios presents a difficulty, I think, for the confessor. He doesn't say whether it is far from the city or adjacent to a section of it. Whatever be the case, you should not negotiate the purchase of anything without seeing it first, along with two other nuns from among those you think are more knowledgeable. Any superior will authorize your going out for this. Don't trust any friar, or anyone else; you well know the trick they tried to play on us. I wrote to you about this in another letter; I don't know if it arrived there.
7. My brother's response to your letter to him is enclosed. I opened it by mistake but did not read any more than the beginning words. As soon as I saw it was not for me, I closed it. Father Prior is leaving with me the documents for withdrawing the money here, but I lack the delegation to do so. Roque de Huerta has it and he has left for your region on official business. Anyway, send it with the document Father Prior asked you to send for Valladolid and address it to the prioress of this house. For if God gives me a little health, I won't be here much beyond the end of this month. They are giving me orders to go to Segovia and from there to Valladolid to found a house in Palencia, which is four leagues from there.
8. I told them to send you the account of the foundation in Villanueva, and so I am not saying anything more here except that they are doing very well and I believe that our Lord will be greatly served there. From here I brought as prioress a daughter of Beatriz de la Fuente. She seems very good and as suited for the people there",2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,4,7,7,0,3,12,0,1,0,10,4,6,14,2,3,3,0,0,2,0,0

Ask our Lord that he may be served by these foundations. Remain with him, for I am in no condition to say more. Although the fever is slight, the pains in the heart and the uterus are severe. Perhaps it won't amount to anything. Pray for me, you and all the nuns. Beatriz de Jesús will tell you about Madre Brianda.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
9. Our Madre arrived here on the eve of Palm Sunday, I along with her. We found Madre Brianda to be so sick from the blood she has spit up that they wanted to give her extreme unction. Now she is somewhat better, although some days she still spits blood and she has a continual fever. There are days when she gets up. Think what would have happened if they had brought her to Malagón. She -- and the community -- would have been lost, and the nuns would have undergone a real trial because of the needs of the house.
10. Our Madre has taken away two other nuns now; please God that will be enough. Have the nuns pray for her and for me, for I have great need.
11. Pray for the election of the general, that they will elect someone who will be a good servant of His Majesty. I encountered Padre Gracián here; he is well. Concerning the stove, we want you to know that we spent almost one hundred reales, and it was worthless -- so much so that we broke it apart. It used up more wood than any benefit that was coming from it.
12. Send someone to visit the prior of Las Cuevas for me and give him my best regards, for -- being in my present condition -- I'm unable to write. And see to it that now you take more care to have someone visit him so that it doesn't appear that because he is not in a position to help us, we are forgetting him; it would seem bad ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, my lady. I arrived here in Toledo on the eve of Palm Sunday, and although I had traveled thirty leagues, I wasn't tired but felt healthier than usual. After arriving here, my good health has turned bad. I don't think it will amount to",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,2,1,15,0,7,14,0,0,3,6,4,9,13,3,1,1,1,8,7,0,0

2. I was delighted with the news they gave me here about your improvement. I received your letter in which you tell me that the illness did not suffice to take away your good resolve. May God be praised for everything. I hope in His Majesty that when you are well enough to follow through on your plan, what I have mentioned to you will be accomplished. And if it is not, an alternative will be provided so that your holy desire may surely be realized.
3. I am certain, if God gives me the health, that before long I will go on from here to Madrid, although I wouldn't want anyone to know about this. I am not sure how we will be able to meet, but I will inform you secretly of where I am staying. Write to me and do not forget to pray to our Lord for me and to give my regards to Padre Valentín, although I don't want you to inform anyone of my plan to go there.
4. They tell me that a provincial now appointed for this province of the Society will soon be there, if he hasn't already arrived. You should know that he is one of my best friends. He was my confessor for some years. Try to speak with him, for he is a saint, and do me the favor of hand delivering my enclosed letter to him when he arrives, for I don't know how I would get it to him in any better way. May our Lord guide you in all things, amen.
5. I found that our Sister Inés de la Encarnación had gotten so chubby that I was surprised, and I was consoled to see what a great servant of God she is. May he guide her. She excels in the obedience and in all the virtues.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
6. Father Prior has been well. I gave him your message. I owe him much. I ask you to get an answer to the enclosed letter and send it to me in a very safe way, for this is important to me.
Today is 8 April. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I tell you that God is allowing this poor man to keep tempting us to see the extent of our charity. And indeed, my brother, I show so little charity toward him, that it greatly grieves me. It is not the kind that I should be showing my",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,4,16,1,2,25,0,0,1,10,4,11,13,7,2,1,1,1,2,0,0
"1002",1580,23,"brother, nor even the kind I should show my neighbor. There is every reason for me to be feeling pity for him in his need, and I feel hardly any. I make up for this by thinking immediately of what I ought to do to please God, and with His Majesty in the picture there's no trial I would not undergo. If it were not for this, I tell you I would not have tried in the least to prevent his trip. My desire to see him out of your house was so great that my happiness far surpassed anything I felt on account of his trial. And so I beg you for the love of our Lord, to do me the favor of not bringing him back into your house no matter how much he begs and how great his need, so that I may be at peace. Indeed, in this matter of wanting to stay with you, he is crazy, although he may not be so in other things. I know from learned men that this is truly possible. And the fault does not lie with La Serna but with his illness, for he wanted to do the same before there was any idea of going there. And truly I have this fear that some disaster will befall him.
2. He says that you are right in being angry, but that he can't do anything more. He well understands that he is a drifter, and he must be exhausted. He says that he was so unhappy at La Serna that he would have rather died than stay there. Now he has arranged with a muleteer to go to Seville tomorrow, but I don't know for what purpose. He is so fragile that one day of sun along the road will kill him -- he was already suffering from a headache -- and in Seville there will be nothing for him to do but spend money and beg alms for the love of God. I, in fact, believed that he still had something that was being kept by Doña Mayor's brother, but he doesn't have anything. It has seemed to me, and only for the sake of God, that I should make him wait until a reply to this letter comes from you, although he is convinced it won't be of any help. Nonetheless, since he is beginning to realize -- finally -- what a lost situation he is in, he is going to wait. For goodness' sake",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,3,4,2,11,13,2,2,4,13,7,14,14,6,2,2,4,0,3,2,0
"1003",1580,24,"answer me right away and send your letter to the prioress, for I am writing to her to forward it to me the first chance she gets.
3. This unexplainable sadness of yours that you write me about must be caused, I've been thinking, by his departure, for God is very faithful. And if this brother is crazy in this matter, as I believe he is, clearly you would be more obliged by the law of perfection to assist him as you can, not allowing him to go where he will die, and to take the alms you have for others and give them to him as to someone to whom you are more obliged, just as you would be if you were in debt to someone. Otherwise, I don't see that you owe him anything, but much less did Joseph owe his brothers anything.
4. Believe me that God wants anyone to whom he grants the favors he gives you to do great things for him -- and this is a very great thing. But I tell you that with your temperament if he should die along the way, you would never finish lamenting the fact, or God perhaps allowing it to weigh heavily on you. So it is necessary that we consider these things before making an irremediable mistake. If you conduct yourself before God as you ought, you will not be any the poorer for what you give him, for His Majesty will give it back to you in other ways.
5. You gave him two hundred reales for clothing and more for food and for other things that he used while in your house. All of this may seem little, but the cost mounts up to more than you may think. With what you have given him he has enough for his food this year wherever he may choose to go. With another two hundred reales that you might give him each year for food added on to what you were giving him for clothing he can live with my sister (who he says invited him) or with Diego de Guzmán. The latter gave him one hundred reales, which he will spend on this trip. Next year when you decide to give him something you must not give it to him all at once, but give it little by little to the one who will be providing his food, for from what I see he will not be staying long in one place. It's a great pity.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,6,5,2,5,7,1,0,3,9,5,13,20,10,2,1,0,0,0,0,5
"1004",1580,25,"But in exchange for his not staying in your house I consider it all for the good. Figure that you are giving a part of that money to me as you would if you saw me in need. I will be grateful, considering it to have been given to me, and have a strong desire not to be a burden to you. I tell you that for some time now I have been longing to see him out of your house, for I sometimes felt afflicted by having to see you put up with that torment and by the fears I mentioned.
6. Since this matter was the purpose of my writing, I have nothing else to add except that I will get the documents from Padre Nicolao, for I believe he is bringing them from Seville and said he will come to see me. I was delighted that Lorencico was so close by. And may God be with him. I will try not to stay here long, for my health isn't as good here as in other places. God willing, I will go to Segovia.
7. Fray Antonio says that, even if for no other reason, he will go there to see you. Padre Gracián is no longer here. My regards to Don Francisco.
Today is Quasimodo Sunday.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your honor. Because you will have received my long letter on this subject of Pedro de Ahumada, I now have nothing more to say than beg you to answer at once and give the letter to Mother Prioress, for many people travel here from Avila. The poor man is here spending his money and must be very distressed judging by how thin he has gotten. It would sadden me very much if the answer were not to come before the time I depart, which I think will be soon.
2. I am better than I was. In sum, it must be all due to my former illnesses, and there's no reason to be surprised. But I am surprised that I am not worse. I think it was good for my health in Malagón not to have so many letters to answer and so much business.
3. We have heard again from Rome. The negotiations are going very well, although opposition is not lacking. Pray to God about this and about what must be done for Pedro de Ahumada, that His Majesty may enlighten you as to what is the best action to take.
4. I already",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,6,6,0,6,14,2,0,2,13,6,11,7,5,5,4,2,0,3,0,0
"1005",1580,26,"told you that I had been given the four hundred reales. He must have been using what Diego de Guzmán gave him, and has spent it all. I tell you that with my nature I agonize over not being able in good conscience to give him anything. I would be very happy to do so just to relieve you of this burden. May the Lord provide a remedy.
5. It's painful for me that you do not have Mass except on feast days. I keep trying to think of a solution, but I don't find any. Pedro de Ahumada tells me that your house, especially the bedrooms, is much better than the one in Avila, which made me very happy. But it seems to me that having the young plowmen living in the house would cause a lot of turmoil. If you built some little house for them to stay in, you could get rid of a great deal of noise in the house. Why didn't you divide the kitchen as we had agreed? Well, such jabbering! I realize that each one knows his own house better ...
6. This Serna who is bringing these letters says he will return here within eight days. If you have not already sent your reply, have him bring it to me, for I will not yet be gone. Even if I should have to leave, I would wait.
7. Regarding what you said about Pedro staying in one of our monasteries, he already mentioned it to me, but that wouldn't work out. They don't take in seculars, nor would he be able to bear eating the meals given him. Even now if the meat in an inn is not tender and well cooked, he can't eat it; he will go along on only a pastry. When I can, I send him some trifle, but this isn't often. I don't know who would be able to put up with him and be so precise in serving him.
8. This humor is a terrible thing that does harm to oneself and to everyone else. May God give you the good I beg for you and free you from Pedro's returning to your house. All other means of helping him I desire to try so that if he should die, neither you nor I will have any regrets.
9. My best regards to Don Francisco and to Aranda. May God watch over you and make you very holy, amen. Why don't you tell me how you are getting along",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,8,2,6,1,7,16,1,0,2,8,8,17,16,4,1,3,0,0,3,0,5

Today is 15 April.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence. Yesterday I wrote to you and afterward the occasion arose to send some letters to Father Vicar. You being so poor, it isn't right to make you pay so much postage, but this cannot be helped.
2. In your charity, please send this letter to my brother along with the one addressed to him so that he will know that Padre Nicolao, having arrived late today, is now here. I immediately asked him about the money for my brother. He tells me that he will leave me authorization so that the prioress here may withdraw the money from the amount they will be sending and send it to you. He tells me that the one who has the money has assured him that he will give it to him at once. So from what I understand it will be collected soon. The money from Valladolid, it seems, was sent to Seville for some business transactions and will be recovered; if not it will be paid back in some other way; that is certain.
3. Give my regards to María de San Jerónimo -- tell me how she is -- to Isabel de San Pablo, to Teresa, and all the others; may God make them all saints. May he be with you.
4. In any case try to send me the answers from Father Vicar and my brother, as I have already mentioned to you in other letters. If Father Vicar is gone, let me know where; and the letters for him return to me.
Today is 16 April.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honors, amen. You show me so much kindness and charity through your letters that even were your last letter more severe, I would have felt well repaid and obliged once more to serve you. You say that you sent me a letter through Padre Mariano that I might know the reasons for your request. Because you have given me such good ones and you know so well how to put forth the value of what you want, I'm afraid my reasons are of little weight. And so I'm not thinking of defending myself, but as with those who have a hopeless case I will shout and cry out and remind you that you are always more obliged to favor orphan daughters and minors over chaplains. For, in the end, everything is yours -- how",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,11,10,0,4,13,1,0,2,11,8,4,11,6,0,2,2,0,0,0,1
"1007",1580,28,"much so -- even the monastery and those living in it, but not those who, as you say, are in a hurry to finish quickly, and sometimes with little devotion.
2. You have done me a great favor in agreeing to that matter concerning Vespers, for it's a subject about which I can do nothing. As for the rest, I am writing to Mother Prioress to do as you ask, and I am sending her your letter. Perhaps by leaving everything in her hands and those of Señor Alonso Alvarez, we will gain more. The two of them can work out an agreement among themselves. I kiss your honor's hands many times. I was very sorry to learn of the pain in your side from which you suffered. Here we offered it to the Lord, and so I pray for all of you and for those angels. May God make them his own and preserve them.
3. There is one thing that would seriously inconvenience the nuns and be burdensome to them: a Mass to be said before the High Mass when a saint's feast is being celebrated, especially if there is a sermon. I don't know how that can be arranged. It should matter little to all of you that on such a day the feast be celebrated at the High Mass; and a little before it, the low Mass by the chaplain could be celebrated. The need for this will not arise often. Try to put up with this opposition to your desire and do me this favor, even though the day may be a festive one; of course, I'm not referring to ceremonies requested by one of you. Know that this matter is not important, and you will be doing the nuns a good deed and me a great favor.
4. After the letter to our Father General went out, I realized that there was no reason for it; anything Father Visitator does is as valid as something done by the pope, for no general or general chapter can undo it. The visitator is very learned and well informed, and your honor will enjoy dealing with him. I think that without doubt he will make a visitation of the monastery there this summer, and he will be able to set up firmly what you ask for. I will speak to him about this when he passes through here. Well, I will not depart in the slightest from what you see as serving best for greater stability nor from",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,3,0,0,11,0,7,18,1,0,2,9,4,7,11,3,1,3,2,2,2,1,0
"1008",1580,29,"anything by which I might serve you. I am sorry I am not in a place where I could show you my good will from close at hand. I earnestly recommend myself to the prayers of Señora Doña Francisca Ramírez. I no longer have a fever, glory to God.
5. You can indeed write to me all that you want, for I know the spirit in which you write. My only pain would be to cause you pain. For surely I would not want to cause you any or that anyone in that house do so. As for the rest, nothing that you have ever said has caused me any harm, nor will it. May our Lord bestow on you all the spiritual blessings that I ask His Majesty for, and may he always guide you.
Today is the Sunday after the Ascension.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. Yesterday I received your letters. They came after the one about the rector of Alcalá. I discussed this with Señora Doña Luisa and with the licentiate, Serrano. And he answered in the enclosed letter.
2. Regarding the clash of opinions you mention, I was very happy to learn that your opinion prevailed; for even though the fathers must have enough reasons, it would have been worse not to do what was safest at that time, but to be thinking of points of honor. When honor of the world is lost by one's acting in this way, one begins to understand how important it is to look only to God's honor. It could be they feared that a greater harm might result from a change in approach toward the enmity. The truth is that God provides with his grace when we are determined to do something for him alone. You have nothing to feel distressed about in this case, but it would be good if you presented some reason for excusing those fathers. I feel more distressed to see you going around in the midst of those contagious fevers.
3. Blessed be God that you are in good health, for my illness no longer amounts to anything, as I have written to you. Only weakness remains, for I went through a terrible month, which I spent mostly on my feet. Since I am used to dealing with chronic pain, I thought that in spite of feeling quite sick, it was possible to put up with it. Certainly, I thought I was dying, although",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,1,1,1,14,1,15,19,3,1,2,13,10,10,17,9,2,1,4,2,11,0,0
"1009",1580,30,"I didn't completely believe this, nor did whether I die or live matter to me. God grants me this favor, which I consider a great one, for I remember the fear I used to have at other times.
4. I was delighted to see this letter from Rome; for although the dispatch is not coming as soon as was thought, it seems certain it will come. I don't know what kinds of turmoil its arrival might cause, nor why. It is good that you wait for Father Vicar, Fray Angel, even if for no other reason than to prevent the appearance that you cannot wait to set out on your mission as soon as you receive it; he will take note of everything.
5. You should know that I wrote to Beas and to Fray John of the Cross that you are going down there and about the commission that you have. Fray Angel wrote to me of how he had given it to you. Although I thought for a while that I should be silent, it seemed to me that since Father Vicar told me about it there was no need to be silent. I would so much like not to lose time, but if our documents are to arrive soon, it will undoubtedly be better to wait so that everything can be carried out with greater freedom, as you say.
6. Even if you don't come to see me, I considered it a great gift for you to say that if I want you will come. It would be a real joy for me, but I fear the remarks of our brothers and the fatigue it would cause you, for you still have a long way to travel. I must satisfy myself with the thought that you will have to come eventually out of necessity. I would then like some of your time one day to find relief in conferring with you about the things of my soul.
7. When I get a little more of my strength back, I will try to speak with the archbishop. If he gives me permission for a foundation in Madrid, it will be undoubtedly much better for her to enter there than elsewhere. These nuns become so disappointed when what they want isn't done that they torment me. Since I am waiting to see whether the Madrid foundation is possible, I have not written to the prioress in Segovia, nor have I spoken seriously about their receiving her. I believe that although the",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,1,7,15,3,0,3,15,10,15,11,8,3,6,0,0,1,0,0
"1010",1580,31,"prioress doesn't like the idea, all the other nuns would accept her. But I don't have time to go into this because according to what Father Vicar wrote me, I cannot stay here any longer than is necessary for me to be strong enough to travel, and I am becoming scrupulous about not moving on. There are many nuns in Segovia, and now they want to receive another. But since she would be going there only temporarily, it shouldn't matter to them.
8. If nonetheless you think it worthwhile I will write to the prioress in Segovia. You too should tell her that you would be very pleased if they accepted her, that this is very important. That house has been of little help or almost no help in all our business matters. And when you tell her about all we owe to Velasco, it will have a good effect. Here they just gave five hundred ducats at my request to St. Joseph's in Avila. A tangle of things happened there, which I will tell you about, that was no one's fault; otherwise I would have already dealt with the matter.
9. Truly, until I speak to the archbishop, I don't know if it would be good to bring this matter up in Segovia. Let me know soon what you want done, for there are many carriers who will come here, if you pay a good portage. To bring her to Segovia without the nuns' knowing about her and wanting her would be unacceptable. And the permission from Padre Fray Angel -- which I already have -- sets this acceptance down as a condition. I didn't mention to him who she was. I tell you that I desire to accept her much more than you do. I think it would be better to speak with the archbishop in his house, entering through a church where he says Mass. When I am well enough I will do this and inform you. I have no more to say for now except that may God watch over you and give you what I beg of him. It is 5 May.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your excellency. I have had a great desire to write to you ever since I learned that you were home. But my health has been so poor that since Holy Thursday a fever had not gone away until only eight days ago, and it was the least of",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,3,4,11,0,1,18,0,0,0,15,5,18,10,7,1,4,0,0,2,0,0
"1011",1580,32,"what I suffered. The doctors were saying that I had an abscess on the liver. With bloodlettings and purges God was pleased to leave me in this sea of trials. May it please His Majesty to give them to me alone and not to someone for whom I would feel more pain than by suffering them myself. Here we have learned that the whole business you've been undergoing has come to a happy conclusion.
2. I don't know what to say except that our Lord does not want us to experience joy without some sadness, as I believe you must feel having to be apart from the one whom you love so much. But may our Lord so ordain that you gain greatly in his sight and afterward come to enjoy all consolation together. May it please His Majesty to do for you what I and all these houses of nuns with the greatest care beg of him. So that the outcome be a happy one, I have instructed them to take this very much to heart in their prayers. And, even though wretched, I keep this intention before me, and this we will do until receiving the news I desire.
3. I am thinking about the pilgrimages and prayers you will now be occupied with and how it will often seem to you that life in prison was more restful. Oh, God help me, what vanities are those of this world! And how much better it is not to desire rest or anything having to do with it, but to place everything involving ourselves into the hands of God, for he knows better than we do what befits us.
4. I long to know how your health is and how everything else is going for you, and so I beg you to let me know. Don't worry in the least if the message isn't in your own hand. For since it has been so long since I have seen anything in your handwriting, the messages that Padre Maestro Gracián sends me on your part satisfy me. I am not going to mention where I will be going when I am ready to leave here or anything else, because Fray Antonio de Jesús will be going to Alba soon, and he will give you an account of everything.
5. Anyway, a kindness you must render me now -- for it is important to me that the favor you show me in everything be known -- regards the Society of Jesus. They founded",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,2,10,0,6,17,1,0,4,12,10,7,13,8,2,2,4,4,4,1,0
"1012",1580,33,"a house in Pamplona de Navarra and experienced a very peaceful beginning. Afterward such a great persecution arose against them that the people wanted to expel them from there. They sought the protection of the constable, and he supported them, speaking kindly to them and favoring them in many ways. What I ask you to do for me is write a letter to the constable thanking him for what he has done and directing him to continue helping them in every way he can.
6. Since -- for my sins -- I know the affliction that religious go through in seeing themselves persecuted, I have felt great pity for them, and I believe that whoever helps and favors them gains much in the sight of His Majesty. And I would like you to experience this gain, for I think His Majesty will be so pleased that I would even dare ask the duke to do this if he were here.
7. The people of the city say that the cost of having them will mean less left for themselves. But a gentleman is providing a house and a very good income for them, certainly not leaving them in poverty. And even if they were founded in poverty, the people would be showing very little faith in so great a God if they thought he was not powerful enough to provide food for those who serve him.
8. May His Majesty watch over you and give you so much of his love that during the time of the duke's absence you will be able to endure your loss with calm, for I believe it will be impossible to do so without pain.
9. Along with the one who brings your answer to this, I beg you to send also the letter I am here begging of you. And it must not be so written as to seem to be the usual letter asking for a favor, but it must say that it is your will that this be done.
10. But how importunate I am! Yet after all the suffering that you cause me, and have caused, it will not be hard for you to put up with my boldness.
Today is 8 April, from this house of St. Joseph's in Toledo -- I meant to say May.
Your excellency's unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your paternity, mi padre. After having sent you a letter yesterday, the feast of the Most Blessed Trinity, I received the one you said you had",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,5,7,0,5,21,0,0,3,10,5,10,7,5,3,5,2,0,1,1,1
"1013",1580,34,"written to me at the same time as to Padre Nicolao. The others arrived today. It was truly necessary that our friars remain there in the midst of that turmoil. Blessed be the One who so ordains things. So that you won't feel sorry thinking that your letters were lost, I am writing this one, and I regret that Señora Doña Juana has to be paying so much in postage. I recommend myself to her prayers.
2. I have also received a letter today from the prioress in Segovia who tells me to bring Juana López with me, that all the nuns will be delighted. But I had written to them in such a way that they couldn't have done otherwise. This wasn't necessary as regards the prioress, for she is willing to please you and me. Blessed be God that the need for me to be negotiating these matters, and the others that arose, has come to an end. For I tell you, mi padre, much ingenuity was required, for each prioress looks after her own house and then thinks the rest will get by.
3. It is really necessary that she be provided with a bed, for this can't be avoided, as well as the money for her trousseau. I would have liked to pay for these, but I am extremely poor right now for reasons I will explain when I see you. If you think it would not be good to bring this up now, we will look for another way, although certainly for the moment I don't see any. In what regards the dowry, things will go better if that other foundation is made.
4. For many reasons, I don't think anything would be lost if you came here for Corpus Christi and we were to set out together. Coming in a carriage will not be very tiring. Although Padre Fray Antonio will not let go of the idea of coming with me, his condition is such that we will have much to do for him. Once Corpus Christi has passed there will be nothing else to wait for, except the authorization from the archbishop, which never gets finalized. I was most happy with Beatriz. And what a hurry Padre Nicolao is in to have you go there! In my opinion, for the very same reason, this would not be fitting, and now he himself agrees. This would kill you, even if there were no other drawback. Because we will be speaking of this and other things,",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,4,5,1,7,12,2,1,3,10,6,12,8,8,4,1,1,0,1,0,0
"1014",1580,35,"please God, I'll say no more.
Your paternity's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. I don't know what our Lord intends by allowing so many obstacles to my departing and speaking with this angel.
2. So as to be able to leave, I wrote him today in the form of a request -- it was suggested that I do so, and we shall see what the result is. But another snag arose today, which is my fear that we will miss Padre Fray Angel on the journey. He wrote that after the feast days he would come to Madrid. If we finish our business with the archbishop, however, I don't think waiting for him would be reason enough to delay; so we will set out next Tuesday.
3. Padre Fray Antonio is now much better. He is saying Mass. And so you can be at ease, for I will speak with you there; and if not, we shall see each other in heaven. Padre Fray Antonio was in such a condition that I was afraid to go alone with him, thinking that he might die along the way. And since it would have made me happy for you to come, I tried to bring this about, still failing to realize that when I myself try to get something in this life the opposite happens. Since he was so sick, you had the occasion for coming to see him -- and it would have appeared right. It would be good to write to him and express your happiness over his recovery, for you have been cold toward him.
4. Padre Fray Hernando del Castillo is here. They said the Princess of Eboli was back in her house in Madrid; now they say she is in Pastrana. I don't know which is true; either of these is very good for her. My health is good, glory to God. Let me know as soon as Padre Fray Angel arrives there. These carriers deliver the letters quicker and more reliably. I have already written you two in which I told you that I had received Padre Nicolao's letter and those that came with it. The one dated the Tuesday before Corpus Christi was given to me today, Friday, the day after this feast.
5. I am answering you through Madre Brianda's brother; she is doing all right. All the nuns ask for your prayers; I ask for those of Señor Velasco. Since I wrote to him",1,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,13,1,5,12,2,0,3,8,8,7,6,3,3,6,1,0,3,0,0
"1015",1580,36,"recently, I am not doing so now. I really hope the letter was not lost, for it is important that his sister be there when I pass through.
6. Padre Nicolao told me that he left eight hundred ducats on deposit in Seville, since the prioress wanted to have them on reserve for any need that would arise regarding the negotiations. I tell you this so that the person who lent you the hundred ducats may be sure of receiving them back soon. It will be enough for me to write to Casademonte, and he will send you the amount at once -- I mean if you cannot obtain a loan there. May God direct everything as he sees necessary, and watch over you as I beg of him.
Your paternity's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
7. Have this letter sent to Padre Nicolao and find out from the Carmel what they know about Padre Vicario; and if possible let me know, although I believe we will be leaving here on Tuesday or Wednesday -- unless something else comes up, for it seems a kind of spell has been cast over us. 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I am in Segovia, and very worried, and I will continue to be so until I hear how your health is. For I don't understand why it is that immediately after Pedro de Ahumada left, I received a letter from you and then have heard nothing more from Avila. I am afraid that you might be sick that for this reason the nuns at St. Joseph's are not writing to me.
2. Padre Fray Antonio, who will be seeing you, is bringing this letter and will give you an account of everything. As a result, and because I am very busy, I am not going to be long and will leave it to him.
3. The marriage of the gentleman about which you wrote me did not come about, nor were they in favor of it here. The prioress speaks so well of the young lady that I would consider it most fortunate if she were brought into our family. The prioress is a good friend of hers and is having her come to see me. We will try in roundabout ways to have the prioress send out a feeler to see if you could approach her on such a matter. May the Lord bring about whatever will render him the most service, and may he watch over you.
4. Let me know quickly",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,7,0,3,8,2,0,1,10,6,10,18,4,7,3,1,0,2,0,0
"1016",1580,37,"about your health. I wrote to you from Toledo. I don't know if you received the letter. My best regards to Don Francisco; Padre Gracián who is here sends his also. May God keep you and make you very holy, amen. We arrived here the day before yesterday.
Today is 15 June.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your honor. They were late in telling me about this messenger ... I don't know how you know that you are going to die soon or why you think such foolish thoughts or afflict yourself with what will not come about. Trust in God who is a true friend and will not fail either your children or you. I greatly wish you were in a condition to come here, for I am not able to go there. At least it is very wrong of you not to have visited St. Joseph's in so long a time, for it is close and you wouldn't feel alone. The exercise would do you good. For goodness' sake, don't go on like this, and let me know about your health.
2. I am feeling much better since I've been here, and the small fevers I had have left me. As regards the matter about which I wrote you, I haven't attended to it and won't be able to do anything until after Padre Fray Angel is gone -- and he will be here for eight days.
3. Mother Prioress, Padre Gracián, and San Bartolomé send their best regards, and give mine to Don Francisco.
Let me know about your health, for goodness' sake, and remain with God, for I have no more time.
Today is 19 June.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
4. Perhaps it will be necessary to send you a messenger, for in regard to that matter a step forward has been made which doesn't seem bad. Not until Padre Fray Angel is gone can I do anything. For Mother Prioress at the Carmel of St. Joseph's in Seville.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my mother. It seems our Lord doesn't want me to go long without having something to suffer.
2. You should know that our Lord has been pleased to bring to himself his good friend and servant Lorencio de Cepeda. He was struck by such intense hemorrhaging that he suffocated from it in less than six hours. He had received Communion two days before and died fully conscious, entrusting himself to our Lord.
3. I hope in the divine mercy that he",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,18,2,6,20,0,0,3,13,5,7,13,2,0,0,2,0,6,0,0
"1017",1580,38,"went to enjoy the Lord, for he was at a point in which anything that did not deal with serving our Lord wearied him. For this reason he was happy to stay at his country property which was a league from Avila. He used to say that worldly compliments made him feel uneasy. His prayer was continual because he always walked in the presence of God, and His Majesty granted him so many favors that sometimes I was amazed. He was very inclined toward penance and so he did more than I would have desired him to do. He looked to me for advice in everything; it was strange, the credit he gave to what I told him, and this was because of his great love for me. I am repaying him by rejoicing that he has gone forth from so miserable a life and that he is now safe. And this is not just a way of speaking, but I feel joy when I think of this. I feel sorry for his children, but I think that because of their father God will show them his favor.
4. I have given you such a full account because I know that his death will cause you and all my sisters there, to grieve, and I want to console you thereby. It is a wonderful thing how much he felt their trials and his love for them. Now it is time to repay him and recommend him to our Lord, on the condition that if he has no need of your prayers (as I believe he doesn't, for our faith allows me to think this way), they may serve to benefit the souls most in need of them.
5. You should know that a little before he died he wrote a letter to me here at St. Joseph's in Segovia, which is where I now am (eleven leagues from Avila), telling me things that didn't seem to imply anything else than that he knew what little time he had left to live, for it has amazed me.
6. It seems to me, my daughter, that everything passes so quickly that we should be thinking more about how to die than how to live. Please God, since I am left here, I may serve him in some way, for I am four years older than he, and I never manage to die; rather, I've recovered from the illness I had, and only experience the usual ailments, especially headaches.
7. Tell Padre Fray Gregorio to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,2,11,5,5,17,2,0,2,15,14,9,10,5,1,2,4,0,3,2,0
"1018",1580,39,"consider this letter to be for him and to remember my brother, for he felt deeply the trials of the order. And tell him that I understand what he must be going through with that task, but that he must be patient, and you too. Each day we are waiting for the dispatch to arrive from Rome, and our father is keeping himself busy since it wouldn't seem right for him not to be here when it arrives. He is well, glory to God. Here he has been visiting this house with Father Vicar, Fray Angel, and he will return with me to Avila the day after tomorrow. I don't know how long I'll have to stay there in order to arrange for what must be given to Teresa. The poor soul has lost a great deal with the death of her father -- for he deeply loved her -- and the community did also. May God provide a remedy.
8. You should know that the authorization you gave for payment of the four hundred ducats is worthless, for the trust fund in Toledo will not pay so soon, and please God the amount will be paid. I turned the matter over to the nuns there before leaving. Regarding Valladolid, I will write now to Padre Nicolao to send me the documents because when I am finished in Avila, I think I will receive orders to go there on my way to the foundation in Palencia, and I will then see if something can be done. I should even be going there at once from here. But now that they have a broker, he will be in a greater hurry to collect that money. Consider how you might pay what you owe. If a good postulant comes along, it wouldn't hurt to accept her with this in mind and for what you are contributing to the negotiations in Rome.
9. May God provide a remedy for it all, for I was afraid that the holy prior of Las Cuevas would be missed very much. Nonetheless, I am happy they are allowing him to rest. Let him know this for me and send him my best wishes and highest regards, and the same to Padre Rodrigo Alvarez and tell him that his letter arrived just at the right moment -- all about the good that comes to us through trials -- and that if God is already working miracles through him during his life, what will happen after his death.
10. I",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,1,9,9,2,5,11,1,0,4,11,6,12,8,5,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
"1019",1580,40,"would consider it a miracle, in fact, if this poor soul has become as well aware of her fault as you say. What seems to you very good in that she condemns Garciálvarez, seems bad to me, and I wouldn't believe much of what she might tell me about him. I think he is a conscientious man, and I have always believed that it was she who made him lose his head. Nonetheless, even though everything may not meet our desires, I was delighted with the news. Many prayers here were offered for her; perhaps the Lord has shown her mercy. I was really sorry after I saw in the reports that they had allowed her to receive communion. I tell you, madre, it is not right for things like this to go unpunished, and it would have been good not to allow her to be released from the perpetual prison to which it was decided to condemn her.
11. Your letter took so long to reach me that I think it is too late now to go into the matter in question, for I don't know when this letter of mine will go out. They gave me your letter on the vigil of the feast of St. Peter, and it bore a date in May, the 15th I believe. I don't know what to say. But to be waiting for Padre Gracián to come is foolish. The best thing to do is to have her admit and take back all of her lies before he comes so that it won't appear that he persuaded her to do this. I am amazed that this did not occur to you.
12. In case she has spoken calumnies that at some time might do harm, it is necessary that Padre Rodrigo Alvarez consider what must be done and that she retract what she said and sign it. Please God, my daughter, that this will appease God and that this soul may not be lost. May His Majesty console that poor Pablo. He must be a good man, since God gives him so many trials.
13. Do you think it is some small matter to have a house where you can see those galleys. Here they are envious, for it is a great gift with which to praise our Lord. I tell you that if they didn't have it, they would miss it.
14. Now they have told me that the Moriscos in that region of Seville are planning to rise up with the city.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,10,0,11,12,0,2,3,17,4,9,15,7,2,4,0,1,0,0,0
"1020",1580,41,"You were on a good path toward becoming martyrs. Find out whether this is true and have Mother Subprioress write us about it.
15. I am happy that her health is good, but am sorry that yours is poor. For the love of God take good care of yourself. They tell me that for that urine problem one must gather some dog rose when it is mature, then dry and crush it into powder and take a half real in the morning. Ask a doctor about it. And don't be so long before writing me, for goodness' sake.
16. My best regards to all the sisters and especially to San Francisco. The sisters here and Mother Prioress send their regards. It must seem nice to be in the midst of those flags and the tumult, if you know how to draw spiritual benefit from all the news you probably hear down there, but you need to walk with much care so as not to be distracted. I long for you all to be very holy. But what would happen if the foundation in Portugal were made! Don Teutonio, the Archbishop of Evora, writes me that the distance from here is no more than forty leagues. Certainly, a foundation in Portugal would make me very happy.
17. You should know that as long as I live, I desire to do something in God's service. Since I've done so little, I don't want to spend the time as idly as I have done these past years in which I only suffered interiorly with nothing else to show. Beg our Lord to give me the strength to do something in his service. I have already told you to give this letter to Padre Fray Gregorio, that he can consider it as for him, for I certainly love him in the Lord and desire to see him. My brother died the Sunday after the feast of St. John.
18. Watch for me, in your charity, to see when the fleet arrives. Try hard to get information from those coming from Ciudad de los Reyes whether Diego López de Zúñiga is living or dead. And if he is dead arrange to have testimony of this given before a notary and send it to me taking every cautionary measure. And if possible get two or three to testify; in short, do whatever you can. For if he is dead, we can then buy some houses for the nuns in Salamanca. I have arranged for this from those who",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,3,1,1,4,7,4,4,18,1,0,1,7,6,15,14,10,3,1,2,1,3,2,0
"1021",1580,42,"will inherit them when he dies. It is the greatest pity in the world what the nuns have to put up with where they are. I don't know how it is that they are not dead. He is a gentleman from Ciudad de los Reyes, I mean Diego López de Zúñiga. And if he is alive you must also inform me of when the fleet will leave so that I can send some messages to him. Consider this matter to be very important, for it must be undertaken with great care. He was seventy-five years old and moreover very sick; he is probably by now in heaven.
19. You can write me by way of Madrid, sending the letters to Padre Gracián's mother, Doña Juana de Antisco. I will try to write to you again soon. Please God this letter will not be lost.
May His Majesty watch over you and do what I desire for you.
Today is 4 July.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus My daughters, this is one of the chastisements that our Lord brings about on earth; he takes away its saints. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and give you the spiritual and bodily strength to bear the terrible blow that this trial has been. If it hadn't come from a hand so compassionate and just, I wouldn't know how to console you, so great is my own grief. But since I know how truly this sovereign God loves us and that you have understood well the wretchedness and instability of this miserable life, I hope in His Majesty that he will give you more and more light to understand the favor our Lord grants to those he removes from it once they have come to know him. You can be especially certain, in accord with our faith, that this holy soul is where he will receive the reward that accords with the many trials he endured in this life and bore with so much patience.
2. I have very earnestly begged our Lord for this and asked these sisters to do so as well. And I have asked him to give you consolation and health so that you may again take up the struggle of life in this miserable world. Blessed are those who are already in safety. I don't think this is the time to go on at length, unless with our Lord in begging him to console you, for creatures are of little help in a grief like this,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,18,5,9,23,3,0,6,10,4,7,7,4,1,0,1,2,6,1,0
"1022",1580,43,"especially as deplorable a creature as myself.
3. May His Majesty show you his power and from here on be your companion in such a way that you will not miss the good one you have lost.
Today is the vigil of the Transfiguration.
Your honor's unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your ladyship. When they gave me your letter, I had already written the enclosed. I kiss your hands many times for your care in showing me kindness; this is nothing new. I had very poor health after I arrived here, but now I am all right. And since I have His Excellency present, all goes well, although the peace he brings me would be still greater if you were present; I would have the solace of speaking to you about many things. For a number of reasons I don't think this will be possible as soon as I thought.
2. You will be discussing all of this with Father Visitator, as was written to me, which makes me very happy. He is your devoted servant and I was consoled to observe how fondly he speaks of you, and so I believe that in everything he will do what you request. I beg you to show him every kindness and to convey that regard you usually have for such persons. He is the highest superior we now have, and his soul must merit much before the Lord.
3. As for accepting those nuns, I indeed see the kindness you are showing me. But since Padre Suárez, of the Society, writes to me and is the one they should speak to and learn from in matters concerning our order and the required dispositions, there is no reason for delay. They should seek permission from Father Provincial, and you should request him to receive them; otherwise, ask it of Father Visitator who will grant it immediately. I make out better with him than I do with our Father Provincial; however much I write to him, he doesn't want to answer me.
4. I am sorry about the illness of my lady abbess. May God be blessed because in one way or another you are never without a reason for being distressed. All of us here are praying for her, and for you as well. There is no need to ask this of me when I have such a good bell to awaken me, which is love. May it please our Lord that the illness not be serious and that you will",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,1,9,0,6,22,1,0,2,9,9,9,7,9,1,3,1,1,4,2,0
"1023",1580,44,"soon be well. All the sisters here kiss your hands many times.
5. They have written me that you are deeply spiritual. This was nothing new to me. But I would be happy if I were closer and could delight -- were I not what I am -- in speaking of spiritual things with you. This Father Visitator brings me life, for I don't think he is deceived by me as are all others; God wishes to enlighten him about how miserable I am, and so he catches me in imperfections at every step. I am very consoled by this and seek to make them known to him. It is a great relief to be transparent before one who stands in the place of God. In this way I will benefit from the time I am with him.
6. You must already know that they want Fray Domingo to go to Trujillo, for they've elected him prior there. Those in Salamanca have petitioned their Father Provincial to leave him where he is. It is not known what the provincial will decide. The climate there would be hard on his health. When you see Father Provincial of the Dominicans, scold him for not coming to see me when he was in Salamanca, for he stayed there a good number of days. It's true that I do not have much love for him! This letter is going to end up tiring you out. I'm adding one other, no more. But since I am consoled by speaking with you, I wasn't being careful.
Your ladyship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite For the Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's Carmel in Seville.
1. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. You will have already received my letter in which I told you how God took to himself my good brother, Lorenzo de Cepeda, and how I was going to Avila to look after Teresa and her brother, who feel very much alone. At present I am in Medina del Campo on my way to Valladolid where I am now being ordered to go. You can write to me often because of the regular mail delivery there. You know how happy I am to receive your letters.
2. I am bringing my nephew Don Francisco with me because some documents have to be prepared in Valladolid. I tell you that before all of this is settled there will be no lack of trials for him or for me. If I hadn't been",2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8,0,3,14,1,0,2,8,8,9,5,6,3,2,3,1,4,2,0
"1024",1580,45,"told that I am rendering God a great service in that I am protecting my nephews, I would have let the whole thing go since I have little desire to become involved in these matters. My nephew is very virtuous.
3. You have to help me from there with anything having to do with the Indies, and so I beg you for love of God that, when the fleet arrives, find out if there is any money being brought for my brother -- please God he may be enjoying glory -- and let me know so that arrangements may be made to collect it. And don't neglect to do so with care, and find out if they are bringing any letters; try to get information about what I mentioned in a previous letter, whether Diego López de Zúñiga who was living in Ciudad de los Reyes is dead.
4. My brother left the money owed to him by your house for the construction of a chapel at St. Joseph's in Avila, that he might be buried in it. I have already told you that the authorization for payment that you sent makes it so difficult to recover the money that I don't know if anything will be collected. At least the money in Toledo -- which I entrusted to the charge of the nuns -- will be given, I think, little by little and late, if at all. For the debtor says that I don't know what kind of calculations have to be made, because he has letters from somewhere else, or I don't know what, that testify to a partial payment that was made. And he enjoys such prestige that no one wants to pressure him about anything. As for what is owed to Valladolid, I will now find out if Padre Nicolao sends me the papers. Since I am executor of the will, I will have to try to collect, although I don't want to. So you should arrange to settle this debt. And for what he has lent and given to the order, it wouldn't be a bad idea to accept a nun without a dowry, if you find a good one.
5. The enclosed letter addressed to the president of the Chamber of Commerce in Seville is from the bishop of the Canary Islands, who is a friend of his. He asks him to take care of holding the money should it arrive from the Indies. See that it is consigned to a trustworthy person and that",2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1,11,7,2,4,13,1,0,1,13,7,13,16,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"1025",1580,46,"everything is arranged in the best way possible, my daughter. Do all this for me as a way of celebrating what I now wish to tell you.
6. You should know that five days ago our brother Fray Jerónimo Gracián received a letter from Fray Juan de Jesús in Rome. (Padre Gracián is now here, for he has accompanied me on this trip and been of great help to me in these business matters.) In the letter, Fray Juan tells Padre Gracián that the brief concerning the matter of our negotiations has been given to the king's ambassador in Rome to send to the king and that the brief was being brought in the same mail delivery as his own letter. And so we are certain that it is now in the hands of the king. In his letter Fray Juan gives a generous summary of the brief's content. May God be praised who has shown us so much favor. You can truly give him thanks.
7. Padre Fray Jerónimo told me that he would write to Padre Fray Gregorio. I don't know if he will be able to, because he is preaching today. If the mail service allows him the time, he will not fail to write. Otherwise you may give Fray Gregorio this news and my regards. Please God he is in good health, for I felt sorry about his illness. Write to me briefly if he is now well, for until knowing this I am not going to write to him. I also need to beg him to help you get this information I am asking of you. And tell me what kind of summer you're having, for I am afraid for you when I see how hot it is here, and let me know how Beatriz is doing and all the nuns. Give my best regards to them and especially to Mother Subprioress. Padre Nicolao is well, glory to God.
8. My health is reasonably good, along with many worries and trials, but they don't bother me much. May His Majesty be with you and preserve you for me. I feel so fortunate to have you there for these business matters from the Indies, for I think everything will be done well. Write to me also as to whether, when some money arrives, if I send you the authorization, you would be able to collect it for me and keep it in your house. Write at length about your health. May God bestow it upon you in",0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,3,7,0,5,19,2,1,1,9,5,9,10,6,1,0,4,1,4,0,0
"1026",1580,47,"the measure that I desire and the need that he sees, amen.
Today is the feast of the Transfiguration.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. Because Father Rector and the prioress will tell you about how we arrived here, I will not enlarge on the matter.
2. I greatly desire to know how your health is and how your business affairs are going. I have more time here -- if I could benefit from it -- than anywhere else to pray for you. May it please our Lord that I be good for something, for there is no lack of desire in me that you have good health and much holiness. I am far better than I was there, although I have the usual ailments, especially the palsy; but without the fever and nausea that I had in Segovia, I am doing well.
3. When I arrived from Avila, they told me that the documents from Rome had arrived and were in accord with our proposal. I haven't heard anything more. I beg you, since this messenger has to return, to inform me about everything -- especially about your health.
4. The prioress is fine; she begs for your prayers. She carries out her office very well. May our Lord make you a great saint.
Today is the 8th.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. My grief greatly increased at the thought of what you must be going through. May God be praised who in so many ways grants us favors. Believe, my sister, that suffering is a great favor. Reflect on how everything passes so quickly, as you have seen, and take heart; consider how the gain will be without end.
2. Since Juan de Ovalle is the messenger -- who will tell you what we spoke about -- and because it is almost one o'clock in the morning, I will not be long. If I succeed, Don Francisco will accompany Señor Juan de Ovalle, and if he doesn't go now, I'll try to get him to leave soon. You don't need to recommend that I do all that I possibly can.
3. It is very hard for me now to have to get involved in arranging a marriage after taking care of so many business matters; although I owe all this to the one who is in glory and to having been told that it is for God's service. Beseech",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,3,17,1,2,21,0,0,2,6,10,11,12,6,2,2,1,1,5,0,0
"1027",1580,48,"him that we might do what is right. I will inform you of what happens here.
4. My best regards to my niece and nephew. I entrust them to God, who is the one able to give them what they deserve, for to trust in creatures is of little worth.
5. May His Majesty be with you and watch over you for me. Give my regards to Mother Prioress and tell her I am well. I have some letters of hers here that I haven't been able to read since I arrived yesterday, for there are so many visitors and business matters to take care of -- and so neither am I able to write to her.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. May the Holy Spirit be always with your lordship, amen. I tell you that I cannot understand why these sisters and I delighted and rejoiced with such tender feeling in the favor you showed us with your letter. Although we receive many letters and are accustomed to receiving kindnesses and favors from persons of great merit, they don't move us the way all that comes from you does. It's a mysterious thing we do not understand. And this is a fact I have attentively observed in these sisters and myself.
2. We have only an hour to respond, and in my opinion we would need many hours, for they are anxious to do what you ask of them, and your godmother has the idea in mind that her words must be efficacious. If their effect were to be in conformity with the affection with which she utters them, I am truly certain that they would be beneficial. But this is a matter for our Lord, and only His Majesty can move hearts. It is a great favor he does us in giving you both good desires and insight into things, for in so great a mind it is impossible that God not bring these two about little by little. I can truthfully say that apart from the business that concerns the bishop, I do not now know anything else that gives my soul more joy than to see you master of yourself. Truly I have thought that only God can fulfill the desires of so courageous a person. And so His Majesty has done well in allowing that on earth you be overlooked by those who could have begun to satisfy some of those desires. You must pardon me, for I am sounding foolish.

"1028",1580,49,"is of the boldest and most miserable people that when you give them a little help they want a great deal more.
3. Padre Fray Gracián was delighted with your message, for I know of his love for you and that he has the desire to serve you whom he is obligated to -- and I believe even more so in your case. He recommends you to the prayers of the good persons with whom he deals. And he does so with such desire to help you that I hope in His Majesty these prayers will be heard. He told me one day that your being very good would not satisfy him but that he wants you to be very holy. My thoughts are lowlier. I would be happy if you were satisfied only with what is necessary for yourself and not extend your charity so much that you are trying to get things for others, and I see that if you took into account only your own repose, you could find it and become occupied in acquiring perpetual goods and serve the one who will keep you with him forever and never tire of bestowing his blessings on you.
4. We already knew when the feast of the saint you mention occurs. We have all agreed to receive Communion on that day for you and thereby settle our debt. We will celebrate that day with joy and in your honor, doing so as best we can. Through the other favors you have done for me, I have seen that I can ask you for many things if I have the need. But our Lord knows that the greatest favor you can grant me is to be where you cannot give me any of those of which you speak, even if you want to. Nonetheless, when I see myself in need I will turn to you as the lord of this house.
5. I am hearing about the effort María, Isabel, and your godmother are exerting in writing to you. As for Isabelita (de San Judas), since she is new, she is keeping quiet; I don't know what she will say. I am determined not to correct a word of theirs, so you must bear up with them since you ordered them to speak. Truly it is no small mortification to read foolishness, nor is it a small proof of your humility to be content with such miserable people!

Today is Sunday. I don't know if it is 20 August.
Your lordship's unworthy servant and true daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with mi padre, amen. Today, the feast of St. Francis, I received two letters from you in which I learned to my delight that your health is improving. Please God, it will always be good, as I beg of him. I have been very happy about the agreement, for it is a good one. Even if it were for less, litigation is not for us.
2. I am now well, we can say, and I eat better. The same is true of my weakness, for I am recovering some strength, although I don't dare write this myself. Little by little I will get well. Don't be distressed about my sickness; what you have gone through is enough.
3. Oh, how it bothered me that Mother Prioress in her letter did not mention anything about Don Luis, and how Señora Doña Juana is already better. Our María de San José is already up and around, her fever is gone, and her joyfulness makes it seem she hadn't suffered anything.
4. In regard to the letter of Pedro de Ahumada, there's no need to pay any attention to it. I thought it would be even worse. He was very wrong in not sending what they asked of him. Don Francisco will not be protected against him unless he turns over his affairs to me, for I am the one to whom Don Pedro will show some respect. That fortune must have diminished greatly, but it doesn't matter because of the gain in what is essential. Now that I am better, things will not bother me so much, for sickness must greatly weaken the heart, especially for anyone who has a heart like mine. Don't think, though, that I am foundering completely.
5. Teresita's letter pleased me very much as did also the news that Don Francisco is happy and healthy. May God guide him. If Pedro de Ahumada is making the journey on his old nag, it ought to be left with Don Francisco, and Don Pedro should be sent on with a rented mule. But he is so disagreeable that I don't believe he will consent to the idea. The horse does nothing but add to his expenses. And so Don Francisco should tell him that he will",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,4,8,0,10,22,1,3,1,9,7,10,11,7,0,1,0,2,7,0,2
"1030",1580,51,"not be given lodging at La Serna; and that will put an end to his comings and goings. He should bear with him as best he can without giving him anything or signing anything for him. He should tell him that he will always be given what my brother left him -- which is carefully set down -- and remind him that those at La Serna gave him a hundred reales at the request of the prioress. I don't know how he can say that he hasn't been given anything. This melancholy of his is a real trial. And my head is in such a condition that although I am not writing this myself, I am not able to go on as long as I would desire. May God watch over you and make you as holy as I beg of him.
6. Give my regards to those lords and to Mother Prioress, Inés de Jesús. San Bartolomé asks for your prayers and is much consoled to hear that you are well.
7. I very much want Don Francisco to be firm with Pedro de Ahumada, asking him why he won't agree with Perálvarez in the management of the property. They stand in the way of each other. Although Pedro de Ahumada says he is doing something, he doesn't do anything. An administrator is needed both for what Francisco de Salcedo left to the nuns and for this property, and then we wouldn't have to worry so much.
8. In no way should Don Francisco hold back from telling Pedro de Ahumada about his desire to change his state in life (and even tell him more if he can). Things can no longer be concealed, as you mention, for that little page has gone around talking about it. And he will talk more there; he knows well how to exaggerate. The Lord Licentiate Godoy told me here that he had heard it from the former magistrate in Avila and that other persons had told him about it here, and so it is already public knowledge. There is no reason for keeping secret what is going to be done. As soon as it is known for certain, everyone will keep quiet. Given his character, I don't think it will matter to Don Francisco. He wrote me a letter that made me praise God. May God be with you.
9. I am afraid lest that little mule not be good for you, and I think it would be right for you to buy a",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,9,0,3,9,2,0,1,8,7,11,9,3,1,5,0,1,1,0,0
"1031",1580,52,"new one. If this is true, someone can be found to lend the money. I will send the amount to you as soon as we can collect it. Or sell the old horse if Pedro will let go of it. My only fear, mi padre, is that you will buy something that will throw you to the ground. Since that mule is so little, I don't fear your being thrown off. Nor do I think it would be good for Don Francisco to journey to the monastery on an animal that he is not going to donate when he receives the habit. Consider what is the best thing to do in everything, and stop being timid, for you kill me with that.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
10. Read to Don Francisco the part here about Pedro de Ahumada. See if the best thing wouldn't be for you to send him to me, for here we can come to some agreement. 1. Jesus be with your reverences, amen. My health is not good, but even if it were very good, I would have no reason for feeling secure about a life that comes to an end so quickly. As a result, I thought of writing to you this report about what should be done if, please God, Don Francisco makes his profession of vows.
2. The documents concerning the legacy for your house are definitive. God knows the care and labor it cost me to get them to this point. Blessed be God who has done this; they state matters most firmly. We are keeping them in this house in the chest with three keys. Because I need them at times, I am not sending them now. With them is my brother's will (may he be in glory) and everything else that was necessary for making it legal. These documents will be delivered to you from here, for it wouldn't be suitable that they be kept anywhere else than in your house, and safely guarded in the chest with three keys.
3. If Don Francisco should make his profession, you will have to find out what is in his will and give him from the annual income all that he needs to spend, for in his will he can only dispose of this year's income and, I believe, movables.
4. Then the property has to be divided between Don Lorencio and Teresa de Jesús. Until she makes profession, she can dispose of her part as she wishes. Clearly she will do what",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,3,8,8,1,4,13,3,1,0,9,8,15,13,7,1,0,1,2,2,0,0
"1032",1580,53,"you tell her, but it is only right that she remember her aunt Doña Juana who is in such need. Once she has made profession everything goes to the house.
5. Don Lorenzo's part will be entrusted to the same administrator, who will give a separate account of everything that is spent. As for how the money is to be spent, the prioress and nuns have nothing more to do than abide by what the will says.
6. First of all the chapel my brother wanted -- may he be in glory -- must be built. What is left from the four hundred ducats owed by the Seville Carmel should be spent on behalf of Lorenzo for the altarpiece, the grilles, and everything necessary. The prioress has already informed me that she will send at least two hundred ducats soon.
7. It seems to me the will says -- I don't remember well -- that in the distribution of Don Lorenzo's revenues, I should in some things do what I think best. I say this because I understand my brother's desire was to construct the vault of the main chapel according to the drawing that was made for this and that you all saw. By my signature here, I affirm that it is my will that in building the chapel for my brother -- may he be in glory -- the said vault of the main chapel be constructed and an iron grille made, not the most costly but well fashioned and pleasing to the eye.
8. If Don Lorenzo is called from this world by God and doesn't have any children, then the main chapel should be built as the will directs. Be careful not to trust the administrator too much, but seek to have the chaplains go frequently to La Serna to observe how well it is producing. For this property should be valuable, and if one is not very careful, it will quickly go to ruin. In conscience you are obliged not to let that happen.
9. Oh, my daughters, how much weariness and strife these temporal possessions carry along with them! I have always thought this, and now I know it through experience; so much so that in my opinion all the worries that I have had in regard to these foundations in a way have not troubled and tired me out as much as this obligation. I don't know whether my grave illness might have been the cause -- certainly it contributed. Pray to God that he might",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,8,11,1,4,12,1,0,2,9,10,10,12,10,2,4,0,1,2,0,0
"1033",1580,54,"make use of these worries for his service -- this was the main reason I put all my heart into the task -- and pray much for me to His Majesty, for I never thought I loved you so much. May he direct everything for his greater honor and glory and not let temporal riches take poverty of spirit away from us.
On the 7th day of October in the year 1580.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
Keep this report in the chest with the three keys. For the Prioress of St. Joseph's.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. I received your letters and the one from Mother Subprioress, and although they were really old ones, I rejoiced to see a letter from you. But my happiness was tempered when I learned of your poor health. A letter you wrote to Padre Nicolao -- the first part of October -- consoled me very much, because in it you say that you are better. Please God you will go on improving. Don't think those swellings are always caused by dropsy. Here there are nuns who suffer from them and have suffered from them, and some are now better and others are on the way to getting better. At any rate, don't fail to take care of yourself and avoid whatever the doctor says is harmful for you, even if you do so for no other reason than to make me happy and not add to the trials that I am undergoing up here.
2. As for me, I have been among the sick since I came to Valladolid. This is why I haven't written you. My head is still so weak that I don't know when I will be able to write in my own hand. But my secretary is so good that I can trust her as much as myself. You should know that I was so sick they didn't think I would live. Now I have been without a fever for some days. I don't know why God leaves me here unless so that during this year I might see his servants die, which is a great torment for me. The death of Padre Soto didn't grieve me too much. But I am distressed over what Padre Gregorio and the others at Los Remedios are suffering. This plague has been all over, and so there is no reason for us to be surprised, but to praise God, for even though there has been great",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,3,11,4,10,19,3,0,5,10,11,3,7,5,2,2,1,4,6,1,0
"1034",1580,55,"suffering in these monasteries, no discalced nun has died. The good María del Sacramento has been anointed in Alba. Pray very much to God for her, and for me that I might serve God in some way, since he has left me here.
3. What you told me about the former prior of Las Cuevas grieved me very much. For the love of God don't fail to console him in every way you can and send him many greetings on my part -- because of my being so weak I am not writing to him -- and for my Padre Rodrigálvarez compose a special message and give it to him on my part. I see that Father Prior in Pastrana loves you all so much that he doesn't fail to write often about the things going on here, which consoles me greatly.
4. As for what concerns Beatriz, you did the right thing in burning that document, and be sure not to speak about it with her or with anyone. If God is pleased to grant us the favor of seeing this province established, then the decision can be made what should be done about this sister, for as I have often said, it is not good that she go unpunished.
5. I am surprised that there is no message from the Indies for my brother (may he be in glory). At least there should be some letters, for I don't think it is possible that no letters have been written to him. Let me know when the fleet is leaving and if you have remembered what I wrote you about from Segovia, that you try to get information through anyone coming from Ciudad de los Reyes as to whether a gentleman from Salamanca, Diego López de Zúñiga, is alive. If he is dead get two witnesses to testify to this, for he is the one who has to sell us the house for the nuns in Salamanca; they don't have another one, and I fear lest the community will have to be disbanded on this account.
6. Beg and beseech Señor Horacio de Oria to look into this for me and ask him to pray for me and tell him I am careful to do so for him and that I am asking this of him because it is for God's service.
7. Remember to find me a trustworthy messenger through whom I can write to Ciudad de los Reyes in Peru and to the city of Quito. And don't forget to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,2,10,4,6,12,1,0,4,7,4,5,14,3,3,2,0,0,2,2,0
"1035",1580,56,"inform me of when the fleet is leaving early enough in advance. There is a regular mail delivery here, for I continually received many letters from this house when I was down there. Or, inform our Padre Nicolao. I am sending him this letter so as to be sure that you inform him.
8. My head is so weak that even dictating tires me, for this is not my only letter today. The nausea I experienced was so great that it weakened me more than the fever.
9. Give my best regards to Mother Subprioress and to all the nuns. I tell you that I have a great desire to see all of you. Everything is possible with God. May His Majesty watch over you as I beg of him, and make you very holy. Let me know if the swelling and the thirst decrease somewhat. All the nuns in this house are praying very much for you. They were amused about the Moriscos. If you don't write to me in your own hand, don't worry about it, for you can trust the subprioress in everything.
On the 25th of October.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
10. My best regards to San Francisco -- whose letter provided great recreation; and many regards to Sister Juana de la Cruz and the Portuguese nun; and ask all the nuns to pray for Padre Fray Pedro Fernández, for he is nearing the end. We owe him very much and will now miss him greatly. I am sorry about my Padre Gregorio; I would like to be able to write to him. Tell him that this is how saints are made, and I say the same to you, my daughter. I can't get used to not writing you in my own hand. 1. ... tired as I am, I find rest in writing to your reverence in my own hand.
2. Velasco sent you one letter, and Padre Nicolao sent another to Salamanca. I opened the latter consisting entirely of suggestions that arrived too late for the matter concerned, so I tore it up. Within it was one from Padre Gregorio in which he told you that he was leaving for Almodóvar to await the convocation of the chapter. He was afraid of leaving his house and going without permission. It made me sad. Tell me what you know about this and if they have found any trace of Fray Bartolomé de Jesús.
3. Father Vicar, Fray Angel, left here for Madrid about fifteen days ago. He left in",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,11,0,7,9,2,0,2,7,5,5,8,8,2,1,3,5,7,0,1
"1036",1580,57,"a hurry. Since Methuselah is now stirring, I wouldn't want it to be against us. It would be nice to know their intentions as you have known them. I also received the note that came with my letter.
4. I wrote what precedes this yesterday. Today the mail came and with it definite news that although he is not dead, no hope remains that Padre Fray Pedro Fernández will live ...
5. I have a great desire to know how your trip to Seville went, especially when I think of the dangerous creeks. For the love of God, write to me through all possible means. They tell me the mail comes up here from down there. I will find out, but until I know for certain, I will not send this except through Señora Doña Juana de Antisco. Try to find out yourself and then write to me by that means. For all this is necessary in order that I get well completely, although I'm feeling well now since I'm writing such a long letter.
6. You should know that Padre Mariano wrote informing me of the important reason why Padre Macario should be provincial and that I should urge this. What a life! They are great friends. This changeableness frightens me. And I with each passing day become more opposed to this, while he pushes ahead with his usual zeal.
7. Remain with God, mi padre, and answer me about Palencia. May His Majesty grant you what I beg of him and repay you for your charity in writing to me so often after your departure, which was a good while ago.
Today is 8 November.
Your reverence's daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
8. Let me know when the fleet will be leaving, for I must write to Don Lorencio. And ask if there is any traveler going to Quito. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. This letter is not in my own hand because I wrote a great deal to Avila today and my head is tired out. Yesterday I wrote to you through Señora Doña Juana de Antisco, and before that I wrote you another very long letter. Please God it arrived there better than yours are arriving here -- if you wrote any -- for I worry very much until I know whether you arrived there safely. I am writing now so that you will know about the mail delivery between here and there and not fail to use it to write to me. I am well,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,7,1,4,19,2,1,1,18,8,11,8,7,0,0,2,2,2,1,0
"1037",1580,58,"glory to God, and the fever has also left Sister María de San José.
2. What I mentioned in yesterday's letter is the story of Don Francisco, which has astonished us all. It would seem they undid him so as to remake him into a different person. I am not surprised about his behavior toward his relatives, but I am surprised that God so abandons a creature who was desiring to serve him. Great are God's judgments. I felt great pity when I saw him. He is now actively engaged in managing his property and is attached to it, and he is so afraid of speaking with either discalced friars or discalced nuns that I don't think he would want to see any of us, and least of all me. They say that he claims he is afraid that the desire he had will return. In this is seen the great temptation to which he must be prey. I beg you to recommend him to God and show him compassion. He is looking to get married, but not outside Avila. It will be a poor marriage, for he is not without his regrets. The fact that you and Padre Nicolao abandoned him so soon must have influenced his decision very much. And that house in Pastrana isn't very enticing, in my opinion. A great burden has been lifted from me.
3. The chapel is again on track, for Padre Fray Angel wrote me about it yesterday. It all tires me out very much. He never did go to Madrid, for he is coming now to San Pablo de la Moraleja. He says that the general has sent him the acts of the chapter. Padre Pedro Fernández is not dead; he is doing very poorly. Here most of the sisters are well and want to know about you. And my secretary and Madre Inés de Jesús kiss your hands.
4. Since I think you will be concerned about what was paid to Godoy, you should know that I gave orders for it to appear to be a loan, and so as matters ended up he owed me more than I did him.
It is after Matins and the eve of Our Lady of the Presentation, a day I will not forget, for that was the day the near riot broke out when you presented the brief to the Carmel there. May God watch over you and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
5.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,5,11,1,8,12,2,0,5,7,3,10,7,7,5,3,2,1,2,1,0
"1038",1580,59,"God willing, this letter will be legible considering the haste with which it was written. Francisco is very disturbed, and I have learned that he suffers from stomachaches, headaches, and a weak heart. God granted me a great favor by his not taking the habit. He mentioned often in Avila that nobody forced him to do anything. I tell you, mi padre, that I always feared what I now see. I don't know why, but I have felt relief not to have to be responsible for him, even though he says that with regard to his marriage he will not do anything that I would not want. But I fear he will find little happiness. And so if it were not for the fact that I might appear to be displeased over what he has done, I wouldn't bother with what he is planning.
6. If you saw the letter that he wrote me from Alcalá and Pastrana you would be amazed by his happiness and the haste with which he wanted me to intervene on his behalf so that they give him the habit. He must have undergone a fierce temptation. But I did not speak to him about this, because he was very upset and a relative of his was with him. He must feel very embarrassed. May God provide, and may he watch over you. In my opinion he would have been a holy man among holy men. I hope in God for his salvation, for he does have a fear of offending God.
7. Your companion, San Bartolomé, sends her best regards, and she has a great concern and desire to know how you fared along those roads and without us, for here we do very poorly without you; it seems we have been left in a desert. Sister Casilda de la Concepción sends you her regards.
8. May our Lord keep you for us and allow us to see you soon, padre mio, amen. So as not to tire you, I'll say no more.
Your paternity's unworthy subject, Ana de San Bartolomé.
9. If you learn anything about the good Fray Bartolomé de Jesús, let me know, for this would be very consoling to me. 1. ... I should extend my best wishes ... nonetheless both made me happy. Some day would you go to see for me the nun who recently received the veil and speak at length with her and ask her to pray for me, as well as for all these business matters connected with",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,13,0,10,13,6,2,1,10,6,17,16,5,5,4,2,2,3,0,0
"1039",1580,60,"the order. May the Lord make her very holy, and Señora Doña Catalina as well; give her my regards.
2. It is a special mortification for me to see the reputation we have for our poverty while we live in comfort, for as the nuns will affirm we have plenty of food and good accommodations. Some little things ... such that we do not make a big issue of it ... we have more than we need ..., and we send it to our discalced brothers ... Fray Gregorio who is ...
3. I believe that Beatriz will be an honor to you since you do so much for her progress. I was most consoled by what your honor said and that she has not disappointed Mother Prioress. You tell me that at the turn she is a person of few words. Would you tell the prioress -- for I forgot -- to let her remain in that office; reserve is an important virtue for the portresses in our houses. Here I have forbidden Alberta, who is the portress, to speak except in response to what she hears; and if they ask or speak about other things she is to say that she does not have permission for this. In such a way people are more edified than by a lot of talk.
4. Since I am writing a long letter to Mother Prioress (fortunately I can do so since there are no other letters to write) and she can tell you whatever I've not mentioned here, I'll say no more than to ask you not to fail to write to me from time to time, for your letters bring me much consolation. May God be pleased to give you what I desire for you.
Your honor's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite For Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's in Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter, amen. I long to know how your health is. For the love of God, take good care of it, for I worry much over this. Let me know how you feel and how consoled you now are to have our Padre Gracián with you. For it is a comfort to me to think of the relief you will find in having him there for everything. I am better, thanks be to God.
2. I am getting to feel like myself again, although there is no lack of something to suffer with my continual illnesses and cares, which are",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,11,0,5,21,1,0,3,7,9,5,8,1,1,6,2,0,2,1,1
"1040",1580,61,"never wanting. Pray for me, and write to let me know what I should do about these documents you sent me; they're worth nothing for legally withdrawing money. See what can be done, and try to find some aspirant so as to pay the money needed to build the chapel my brother wanted, for one can no longer fail to begin the construction. I don't have any resources here, for which I am very sorry. I can't do anything more than entrust everything to God that he will provide, as he can.
3. As for the order's business affairs, there is nothing new to say for now. When there is something, you will hear of it from our Padre Gracián. My best regards to all the sisters. Please God they will enjoy the health I desire for them.
4. I have already written you that the one in Toledo who owes you the money is taking his time, and he is a judge for the archbishop. I don't know how anything can be collected from him except amicably. If Padre Nicolao, when he goes there, should want to stay a few days and inquire about the matter with him, perhaps something could be worked out. I had thought that something could be done about this once Francisco's plan to enter religious life was carried out. Everything is breaking down. May God work it out as he can and give you the health that I beg of him.
5. Since there is mail delivery to this city, don't fail to make use of it and write me, and tell our padre to do so, and let Mother Subprioress inform me about how the nuns are getting along with him, and if he is well, and tell her she should write me a long letter about everything so that you don't tire yourself.
6. For goodness' sake be on guard for there is someone in the house who thinks that what amounts to nothing is a serious matter. And let me know how this poor soul is doing, and how Father Prior of Las Cuevas is. Have our padre go to see him and give him my best wishes and also to Padre Rodrigálvarez, who made me happy with his message. My head doesn't permit me to write to him. Let me know how San Jerónimo is. My regards to her and to Sister San Francisco.
Today is the feast of the Presentation of Our Lady.

"1041",1580,62,"for the affairs of the order. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I don't know how to answer someone with so much humility as is shown in your letter and so much graciousness as well, for I do not deserve to be so treated. May our Lord answer for me, and His Majesty repay you, for he has been pleased that I be unable to serve you in any of the ways that I would like, which would be such a blessing for me. I don't deserve anything more. May he be blessed for everything.
2. From the letter accompanying this one, you will see how Don Francisco's choice of a state in life did not depend on any opinion of mine. And by my entrusting the letter to you will be seen my esteem for you. And so I beg you ...
3. ... And it seemed the same to all of us, especially Don Francisco, who showed himself to be what he is, your servant, and with great happiness to be so, and with little desire for Madrid. And that was the conclusion, and he wanted it very much; and I believe he truly did. And so I am not astonished by any signs that may have been given; I trust in your great prudence that this will not take away one iota of the great value you find in him. Nonetheless, I felt deep regret.
4. Since Diego de Tapia went to Madrid and saw such a tangled mess and what little attention was paid to it, he was astonished and wrote to me at once about what was going on. When I wrote to Avila by way of the commander, I did so in order to find out what took place and inform those who were not in Madrid. But they were already gone. On the feast of the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady, they gave me some letters ...
5. ... it was neither Don Francisco's will nor mine that the matter not be brought to completion, for we are not failing to consider your rank as lord. You can be certain that what I can do, which is to recommend you to our Lord in my poor prayers, I will do from here on, and consider myself your servant.
May His Majesty preserve your illustrious honor with much holiness. Amen.
Today is 10 December ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, my son. You can well",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,13,0,3,20,0,0,2,14,4,5,13,4,3,0,1,0,1,0,0
"1042",1580,63,"believe that the bad news about which I must write you in this letter distresses me greatly. But realizing that you will learn of it from someone else and that no one will be able to inform you well about the consolation that such a great trial may contain, I have wanted to tell you myself. And if we consider well the miseries of this life, we will rejoice over the joy of those who are already with God.
2. Two days after the feast of St. John, His Majesty was pleased to bring my good brother Lorencio de Cepeda to himself. A hemorrhage caused a quick death. He had gone to confession and received communion on the feast of St. John. And I believe it was a gift, considering the condition he was in, that he didn't live longer. In regards to his soul, I know well that he was always ready. Eight days before, he had written me a letter in which he spoke of how he had only a short time left to live, although he didn't know the exact date.
3. He died entrusting himself to God, like a saint. And so, according to our faith we can believe that he remained for little or no time at all in purgatory. Although he was always, as you know, God's servant, he was so in the end in such a way that he wanted nothing to do with anything earthly. And except for persons who spoke only of God, everything else tired him to such an extent that I found it hard to console him. So he went to La Serna to find more solitude, and there he died, or to put it better, began to live. If I were able to write some of the details about his soul, you would understand how obliged you are to God for having given you so good a father and would live in a way that shows you are his son. But a letter doesn't allow for more than what was said, except that you should be consoled and believe that he can do you more good from where he is than by being on earth.
4. It has made me, more than anyone else, feel very sad. And the same is true of the good Teresita de Jesús, although God gave her such courage that she bore the loss like an angel, and she is like an angel and a very good nun as well and happy to be",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,15,3,6,21,2,0,3,17,5,8,9,7,0,3,2,0,3,0,0
"1043",1580,64,"one. I hope in God that she will be like her father. As for me I have had no lack of worries until seeing Don Francisco settled as he is now, for he was left very much alone since as you know we have few relatives.
5. He was so sought after in Avila for marriage that I feared he might choose an unsuitable wife. God was pleased that he get married on the feast of the Immaculate Conception to a lady from Madrid who has a mother but no father. The mother wanted this marriage so much that we were amazed, for considering her status she could have done much better. Even though the dowry is small, none of the persons in Avila that we considered could have brought as much even had they wanted to.
6. The bride's name is Doña Orofrisia. She is not yet fifteen; beautiful and very discreet. I mean to say Doña Orofrisia de Mendoza y de Castilla. Her mother is a first cousin of the Duke of Albuquerque, a niece of the Duke of Infantazgo and related to many other titled lords. In sum, on both her mother's and father's side, they say, the noble background is unsurpassable in Spain. In Avila, she is related to the Marquis de las Navas, the Marquis de Velada, and more closely to the wife of Don Luis, of Mosen Rubí.
7. They gave him four thousand ducats. He wrote me that he is very happy which is what matters. What pleases me is that Doña Beatriz, her mother, is a woman of such merit and discretion that she will be able to direct them both and make adjustments, they say, so as to keep the spending within moderation. Doña Orofrisia has only one brother, who is older than she, and a sister who is a nun. If her brother doesn't have any children, she will inherit the primogeniture. This is possible.
8. I don't see any other drawback here except for Don Francisco's lack of means, for the estate is so burdened with debt that if he doesn't soon receive what is owed to him from over there, I don't know how he will be able to live. So, for the love of God, do all you can to get it. Since God is giving them so much honor, they need the means to sustain it.
9. Up until now Don Francisco has shown himself to be very virtuous, and I hope in God that he will continue to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,4,14,2,0,1,11,4,11,8,1,3,3,1,0,0,1,0
"1044",1580,65,"be so, for he is a very good Christian. Please God that I will hear news like this about you. Now you see, my son, how all things come to an end, but the good or bad we do in this life is eternal and will have no end.
10. Pedro de Ahumada is well, and also my sister and her children, although they are left in serious need because my brother -- may he be in glory -- was helping them very much. A short time ago Don Gonzalo, my sister's son, was here. He along with others regard you highly, for you have fooled them into having a good opinion of you. I would have liked to see you become better. Please God you will now do so, and may His Majesty give you the virtue and holiness that I beg of him, amen.
11. You can send letters to the monastery of the nuns in Seville, for the prioress is the same as the one who was there when I was, and all the conflicts have been resolved very well, glory to God. I am writing this in our monastery in Valladolid. The prioress here kisses your hands, and I the hands of our relatives, those lords and ladies.
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of the Carmel of St. Joseph's in Seville.
1. Jesus, Mary. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter, and I hope that His Majesty has given you as holy a Christmas as I desired for you. I wanted very much for this letter to be in my own hand, but my head and the many things I have to do, since the time to leave for Palencia is at hand, prevent me from writing it myself. Pray for us that the new foundation may be a means to render God much service.
2. I am better, glory to God, and consoled to know that you are as well. For the love of God, take care of yourself and be careful about what you drink, for you know the harm it does you. Two sisters who had those swellings were greatly helped by taking an infusion of rhubarb several mornings in succession. Consult with your doctor, and if he thinks it fitting, take it.
3. I received both your letters. In one you mentioned your happiness in having Padre Gracián present. I am also happy that you have someone with whom you feel at ease and can consult; you have been suffering",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,19,0,5,29,0,0,1,7,4,6,8,2,2,1,5,5,2,2,1
"1045",1580,66,"alone for a long time.
4. In the other letter, you were speaking of the business in the Indies. I was delighted that you have someone there who is dealing with this matter carefully, for there is no other remedy for that house in Salamanca. If nothing comes before the day on which they will be obliged to leave the house where they are, we will find ourselves in dire straits. So for the love of God make every effort to have this packet delivered, for it contains the contract that was made for the sale of that house. If by chance the ones to whom the envelope is addressed are dead, write to those persons you mention so that they might carry out the negotiations. And if the letters are delivered to the one to whom they are addressed, they could also look into the matter, and perhaps they will do so with more enthusiasm than the addressee would and take care to send us a prompt answer, something very important for us. You must then urge them to do this and add the enclosed copy of the contract to the letters you write. If it is necessary to give one to each of them, make further copies to go with each letter, and you and the sisters pray to God that they arrive there and that this business will be brought to a conclusion.
5. In what you say about the money for the chapel, don't be distressed if you cannot send it so quickly, for I wrote only in regard to the use for which it is meant.
6. I also received with yours the letter from the Indies. Be sure also that this letter enclosed for my nephew Don Lorencio is sent to him with care.
7. Best regards to Mother Subprioress and the sisters, and I am happy that they now are all well. They should know that they were not the worst off, considering what has occurred here and how long the illnesses have lasted. I still have not recovered completely.
8. The letter addressed to Lorencio mustn't go with the packet, because the one place is far away from the other, but you must find someone who is going to that city, or province, or I don't know what. Be careful, daughter, to carry out these tasks with all due regard. In the packet is enclosed another record of the agreement made regarding the house. You couldn't imagine what those nuns suffer and the trials they",5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,4,5,1,4,13,1,0,2,9,7,12,13,9,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"1046",1580,67,"have had. Write to Don Lorencio at the address he will mention when he writes that he should write to you at the house of St. Joseph, for perhaps he doesn't remember, and that my brother left orders that, with the money you owe him, a chapel is to be built at St. Joseph's where he is interred. You mustn't send the money to Don Francisco but to me, for I will have him give a receipt. I fear he might spend the money on something else, especially now that he is married. I wouldn't for anything want to be a cause of worry for you, but try to get some of the postulants who are entering there, as our padre tells us, to give the money. I wish you had a larger orchard so that Beatriz could be more occupied. I can't accept those excuses, for she cannot deceive God, and her soul will pay for it. In the presence of all the nuns she gave false testimony and did many other things that they wrote me about; either they are telling the truth or she is.
9. Give my best regards to Rodrigo Alvarez and to the good prior of Las Cuevas. Oh what pleasure you give me by showing him kindness. Best wishes to the good Serrano and to all my daughters.
May God watch over you for me.
Don't forget to ask about the rhubarb, for it is something that has been tested.
Today is the last day of the Christmas feast.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus For mi padre maestro, Juan de Jesús Roca, Pastrana.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. Every time you tell me that you are well, it makes me very happy. God be praised who grants us so many favors. I would like to serve you by trying to get the letter you mention from the archbishop, but you should know that I have never spoken either at length or even briefly with his sister, nor do I know her. And you already know what little attention the archbishop paid to my letter when you gave me the task to write him at the time you were planning to go to Rome. I am very averse to insisting if nothing will be gained thereby, especially since we will be asking shortly for his permission to make a foundation in Madrid. I would like to do more than this for you to whom we owe so much, but truly I don't see how.
2.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,9,12,0,2,15,2,0,0,6,6,11,11,7,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"1047",1580,68,"Regarding what you tell me about the constitutions, Padre Gracián wrote me that they said the same thing to him as they did to you, and he has there with him the remarks of the nuns. The things that need to be noted are so few that the response can be given quickly, but it was necessary to be in contact about them with both of you. What seems fitting to me on the one hand seems full of drawbacks on the other, and so I cannot come to a decision. It is very necessary to have everything set so that on our part there won't be any delay.
3. Now Señor Casademonte wrote me that he was given orders by someone in authority not to allow Tostado to have anything to do with the discalced Carmelites, which is very good. The care this friend of yours takes to give us any good news and keep us informed about everything is extraordinary. We certainly owe him a great deal.
4. The dowry which you say that aspirant has seems little to me, for it consists in a property that could perhaps be worth much less when sold, and then paid for late and poorly. So I have decided against her going to Villanueva for they have greater need of money there and have more nuns than I would wish. Padre Fray Gabriel has written me about a relative of his whom it would be more fitting for us to accept even though she doesn't have as much, for we owe him a great deal. When I wrote about that sister, they had not brought me the letter that speaks of the other aspirant. Don't consider the matter any further, for down there they will find the one who is most suited in their case. If they are going to put a burden on the house, it is better that they take someone from their own town.
5. We left Valladolid on the feast of the Holy Innocents for this foundation in Palencia. The first Mass was said on the feast of King David (in great secrecy because we thought there might be some opposition). And the good bishop here, Don Alvaro, had arranged everything so well that there was not only no objection but no one in the city who fails to rejoice in the fact, certain that our presence here will draw down God's favor on them. It is the most unusual thing I've ever seen. I would have thought",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,7,5,0,2,16,0,0,1,11,4,8,16,9,1,4,1,1,0,0,0
"1048",1580,69,"this to be a bad sign if I hadn't remembered the previous opposition of many down there who thought it would not be good for us to come here. And so I was very remiss about coming until the Lord gave me little light and more faith. I think it will be one of the best of the houses that were founded and more fervent, for we bought the house next to a shrine to our Lady in the best section of the city. The people there and in all the surrounding region have the greatest devotion to her. The chapter has allowed us to have a grille looking into the church, something seen as a special favor. Everything is done by the bishop. What this order owes him and the care he shows over its concerns are indescribable. He gives us the bread we need.
6. Now we are staying in a house that a gentleman had given to Padre Gracián when he was here. Soon, with God's favor, we will move to our own. I tell you that you will rejoice to see the conveniences that are here. God be praised for everything.
7. The archbishop has already given me permission to make a foundation in Burgos. In finishing this one here, if the Lord be served, a foundation will be made there, for it would be too far to come all the way back here from Madrid, and I also fear that Father Vicar would not give permission for Madrid. And I would like it if our dispatch arrived first. It's appropriate that we will be there where it gets so cold at the coldest time and where it gets so hot at the hottest time and thus have something to suffer, and afterward be criticized by Padre Nicolao, which really amused me because he has more than enough reasons for doing so.
8. In your charity give him this letter so that he has news of this foundation and both of you may praise our Lord. I would tell you everything about what is going on here so as to stir your devotion, but I am getting tired. The shrine has two endowed Masses every day and many other Masses that are said there. So many people ordinarily visit it that we have been finding this somewhat difficult.
9. In your charity, if you find some messenger there for Villanueva send them news about how this foundation was made. Madre Inés de Jesús worked very hard. I am",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,12,0,5,17,1,1,1,6,13,10,9,6,3,1,5,0,1,0,1
"1049",1580,70,"no help now with anything except for the noise that the name Teresa of Jesus makes.
10. Give my best regards to Madre Inés, and I send them to all those brothers of mine.
Tomorrow is the vigil of Epiphany.
11. In your charity pray for three canons who took it upon themselves to help us, for one especially, who is a saint named Reinoso, and for the bishop.
12. All the important people favor us very much, the fact is that the joy of all the people in general is extraordinary. I don't know where it will all end.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus, Mary. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter, amen. You show me much charity with your letters. I answered them all before I left Valladolid, sending you also the documentation regarding Salamanca. I think that by the time this letter arrives you will have the documentation. We need all the care that you are taking so that the response will arrive in time. May God who sees our need bring this about, and may he give you the health I desire for you. You don't mention how your health is in this letter of yours. And that is wrong, for you know how worried I am. Please God you are better.
2. We were delighted with what the elderly ladies are saying about our padre, and I praise God for the fruitfulness of his sermons and holiness. His holiness is such that I am not surprised by the effect he has on those souls. Write to me about this, for it makes me very happy to know of these things. May God watch over him, as is our need. And you are right in saying that he must cut down on his preaching, for giving so many sermons could do him harm.
3. With regard to the two hundred ducats you say you must send me, I would be happy to receive them because we are beginning to carry out the orders my brother left (may he be in glory). But don't send the money to Casademonte or forward it through Padre Nicolao -- these words are meant only for you -- for he might use it there and I would be left in need here. But send the money to Medina del Campo if the sisters there know some merchant to whom you may send a letter of credit. This is the safest way to send the money and would not cost",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,8,16,0,4,19,1,1,0,8,8,12,10,9,2,4,0,0,2,0,1
"1050",1580,71,"anything. If this is not possible, then try Valladolid, and if that isn't either, then let me know before you send it so that I may tell you how it should be sent.
4. I am getting along fairly well, but I am so busy with visits that although I had wanted to write this myself, I wasn't able to.
5. Enclosed is an account of the events surrounding this foundation, for it makes me praise God to see what is happening and the charity, goodwill, and devotion of this city. May God be given thanks; and have all the sisters thank God for the favor he shows us, and give them my best regards. The sisters here recommend themselves to your prayers, especially the secretary; it consoled her greatly to know that you are well disposed toward praying for her, for she is in great need.
6. I am writing to our padre to let him know the reason why I want this money sent directly to me. I have gotten so tired of relatives after my brother's death that I don't want any arguments with them. I tell you I am distressed over the famine that our padre tells me is going on in that region, for I don't know how you are living; and I'm also distressed that you have to send this money now. I would rather have it given to you. May God provide a remedy and give you health, for with good health one can put up with anything; but seeing you with little health and in need, is an affliction for me. I fear that the climate down there is bad for you, and I don't know how you could leave. May God provide the means, for he has certainly heard your prayers for trials.
7. Tell Sister San Francisco that it never enters my mind now to be displeased with her, but I am so pleased that it grieves me to see her so far away. My best regards to all the sisters and to Mother Subprioress. And remain with God, for this head of mine forces me to be brief. Otherwise I would have to scold you, for what you say to Padre Nicolao made me laugh. On the one hand I see that you need to accept nuns; on the other hand, we have experience here of all the trouble that comes when the numbers are not kept small and of the inconveniences that arise for many reasons. May God bring us",2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,4,12,2,8,16,3,1,1,9,10,13,12,6,4,2,2,3,6,0,0
"1052",1581,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, my sister. I have had the strongest desire to know how you are and how your Christmas was. Believe me, many a Christmas has gone by in which I never have had you and your household so much in mind as this year, recommending you all to our Lord and even grieving over your trials. May he be blessed who did not come into this world for any other reason than to suffer. And since I understand that whoever best follows his example in suffering, keeping his commandments, will have the more glory, I feel greatly consoled; although I would prefer to suffer your trials myself and let you have the reward, or be where I could more easily spend time with you. But, since the Lord ordains otherwise, may he be blessed for everything.
2. On the feast of the Holy Innocents, I set out from Valladolid with my companions in the midst of harsh weather for this city of Palencia. But my health is no worse, although the usual ailments are not lacking. When there is no fever, however, one can put up with them.
3. Two days after our arrival, I installed the bell at night, and a monastery of the glorious St. Joseph was founded. The happiness of all the people here was so great I was amazed. I think this is partly due to the fact that they see they are thereby pleasing the bishop, for he is much loved here and he favors us. Things are proceeding in such a way that I have hope in God this will be among the best of our houses.
4. I have no other news of Don Francisco than that his mother-in-law wrote a little while ago saying he had to be bled twice. She is very happy with him, and he with both of them. Pedro de Ahumada must be the least happy, according to what he has written to me. For Don Francisco seems to want to live with his mother-in-law, and it is not possible for Pedro de Ahumada to join them. It's a pity that he cannot be at rest anywhere. He wrote to me that he was now well and that he was going to Avila for the Epiphany to find out how to collect the money from Seville, since they are not giving him anything. The more those in Madrid inform me about this marriage, the more reason I see",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,2,13,1,6,23,0,0,5,11,9,8,10,6,2,1,1,0,2,1,0
"1053",1581,2,"for us to be happy, especially over all they say of the discretion and pleasing manner of Doña Orofrisia. May God protect them and give them the grace to serve him, for all earthly consolations pass away quickly.
5. If you send the letter to Mother Prioress in Alba to forward to Salamanca it will surely arrive here, for there is a regular mail delivery. For goodness' sake don't neglect to write to me; you owe it to me these days, for I have had you all on my mind more than I would like.
6. Let Señor Juan de Ovalle consider this letter as addressed also to him -- I would like to know how he is getting along. Regards to Señora Doña Beatriz. May God watch over you all and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen.
Today is 13 January.
7. Don't fail to write to Don Francisco, which would be appropriate. He is not to blame for having failed to inform you of his marriage; it came about in such a way that there wasn't time. Madre Inés de Jesús is well and sends her best regards to all of you.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's, Salamanca.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. I deeply regret having to take nuns from your house who please you, but this can't be helped; and since the one who is displeasing to you is also departing, have patience and pray for them all so that they may do well that which they are being called to do and that your house will not lose the good reputation brought to it by those who are leaving. I hope that will be so, for very good nuns are remaining with you.
2. It seems to me you are still going about with your infirmities. It is a great favor God grants us that you can stay on your feet; be careful, for the love of God. May it please him to let me see you finally out of that house, for I tell you it is a cause of much worry for me. His Majesty must desire that you suffer in every way. May he be praised for everything. And may His Majesty reward you for the limes. I had been so ill the day before that they were a delight to me, and also the veil; the one I was wearing I adapted for use as a larger one, for those you",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,1,15,0,8,23,1,1,6,4,5,8,11,10,2,1,0,1,1,1,0
"1054",1581,3,"sent were lovely. Nonetheless, do me the charity not to send me anything unless I ask for it; I prefer that you spend the money on caring for yourself.
3. In this foundation everything is going so well that I don't know where it will end. Ask our Lord to give us a good house; we don't want the shrine. There are many houses, and they are good ones. Many people are looking after us, and the bishop never stops doing us favors. In your charity pray to God for him and for those who are helping us.
4. Write a note to Fray Domingo, should I fail to write him, so that he will know about this foundation, although I will try to write. If I don't, give him my best regards.
5. I was most pleased to see the care you took to provide sisters, something that is not always done, and you did the right thing, especially with regard to Isabel de Jesús, who is so deserving. It seems she is happy.
6. Because she and the others will tell you about everything else, and since I have other letters to write, I'll say no more than ask our Lord to watch over you for me and give you all the holiness I beg of him, amen. The missals are very nice and you sent so much that I don't know when we will be able to pay for it.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
Padre Maestro Díaz will give the enclosed letters to my Dominican fathers; you can give them to him. Yesterday I received a letter from Valladolid. Our Sister María de San José is very happy and joyful. They write me things about my Isabel de Jesús that make one want to praise God. And you should do so, for you have there two angels who are always praying to His Majesty for you. Jesus
My daughter and my lady,
1. To receive God's help is better than early rising. You are hereby being admitted to this house with the approval of all the sisters. I would have liked to give you the habit before departing, but that is not possible since I will be leaving early tomorrow morning. We will meet sometime in the future.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, amen. I want you to know that yesterday the bishop sent us twelve bushels of wheat. Since the alms are being given in your name, it is good",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,5,20,0,1,23,0,0,1,7,7,8,7,7,3,1,0,0,0,0,0
"1055",1581,4,"that you know about it in case you might see it. I beg you to let me know how you are getting along on such humid days and if you have gone to confession for the feast of this glorious saint. He is a very great saint, and it is right that you be devoted to him, since you are so kind to the poor.
2. Señora Doña María has sent me word that she will not be satisfied about the reliquary until you give it to me. She speaks of it as though it were her own. It also seems to me that you have a right to it. Since it is the Lord who will repay you for this favor and all the favors you do for us, he will understand this proceeding and render a fair judgment.
3. May His Majesty preserve and guide you for many years. Mother Prioress and the sisters here ask for your prayers.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence, amen. From this letter you will see what is going on in Alba with its foundress. The nuns have begun to fear her, and she has made them take in postulants. They must be in great need. I don't see any way of reasoning with her. You will have to inquire about everything.
2. Don't forget to leave orders everywhere about veils and to explain which persons the constitutions are referring to. And this should be done so that the constitutions don't seem stricter than they are. I fear more the nuns' loss of the great joy in which our Lord is leading them than those other things. I know what a discontented nun is. As long as they continue on as they have in the past, there is no reason to restrict them to more than to what they promised.
3. There is no reason why the confessors should see them with faces unveiled, or the friars of any order, and much less our own discalced friars. You could explain how in the case of an uncle who has care of them, if they have no living father, or that of some close relative, they would have a reason for doing so. Or for a duchess or countess or some eminent person; in sum, where there would be no danger but benefit. And without a reason of this sort, the curtain should not be drawn back. If some other occasion should arise over which there is doubt, permission should",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,14,0,5,13,3,1,1,17,12,13,19,3,4,1,0,1,1,0,0
"1056",1581,5,"be asked from the provincial; otherwise it should never be done. But I fear lest the provincial give it easily. It seems that spiritual guidance could be carried on without having to draw back the curtain. You can look into this.
4. I have a great desire that some postulant will come to Alba bringing enough to pay something of what has been spent on the construction. May God direct things according to need. Here the nuns are doing well, for they have more than they need in everything. I mean exteriorly because for inner happiness these things are of little use; more of that is found in poverty. May His Majesty give us such understanding, and may he make you very holy, amen.
Your reverence's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, and may he give you spiritual and bodily health. We are all praying with concern for this, and there is no reason for you to thank us, because it is our obligation to do so. And we are doing the same for Señora Doña María. I earnestly ask for her prayers, and may our Lord repay you for the good news you are always sending me.
2. Now I am waiting each day for the news that is lacking and should be here without delay. I am certain there will be no want of diligence on your part to inform us soon. Indeed it makes us praise our Lord that you never tire of doing us acts of favor and charity.
3. I already wrote you that I received the packet of letters from our Father Provincial, Fray Angel, and that I answered him. Now I am writing to him again. If he is not there, would you have the letters forwarded with special care when a messenger is available. It doesn't matter if you don't receive a reply; there is no reason to ask for one.
4. I have not been very well, having the usual ailments. Now I am better and am happy to see the joy those Fathers of mine will have. May it please our Lord that I see them content with everything and that the meeting will enable us to render him great service.
5. I beg you that when you see Señor Juan López de Velasco you tell him that yesterday I received his letter by way of Valladolid and that it would be better if letters were ordinarily addressed here because the postmaster",3,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,4,17,0,1,21,1,0,0,8,8,13,13,8,4,0,0,1,2,0,0
"1057",1581,6,"is a friend of mine, and that I will do what you ask. I think I have a good deal to do here now for some days, but even if not, I don't think I will leave -- unless obedience orders me otherwise -- until I see our affairs completed. May God bring this about, as he can, and may he watch over you and give you the temporal and spiritual rest that I and all the nuns beg of him.
6. Madre Inés de Jesús asks for your prayers. Pardon the fact that this is not written in her hand. I was happy to have had the time to write myself, and I wish this were always so.
From Palencia in this house of St. Joseph,
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. I consider it very important that vicars not also be confessors to the nuns, and this should be always so. It is imperative for these houses that the nuns have the friars as confessors, as you say and I myself see. I would support having things remain as they are rather than grant that each confessor be also the vicar. There are so many drawbacks to this, as I will explain to you when I see you. I beg you to trust me in this matter, for when St. Joseph's was founded much attention was given to it. And one of the reasons it seemed to some persons, myself included, that it was good that the monastery be subject to the bishop was to avoid this practice. There are serious disadvantages that result from it, as I have learned. And for me one is enough: I have seen clearly that if the vicar likes some nun, the prioress cannot prevent him from talking to her as much as he wants, for he is the superior. This can result in a thousand woes.
2. For this reason, and for many others, it is also necessary that they not be subject to the priors. It will happen that someone who doesn't know much will give orders that are disturbing to all the nuns. There won't be anyone like mi padre Gracián, and since we have so much experience, we have to look ahead and remove the risks. The greatest good that can be done for these nuns is that no talking with the confessor take place other than what is necessary for the confession of sins. As for safeguarding the recollection of the monastery, it is enough that the confessor inform",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,20,0,7,14,3,0,2,18,7,7,11,9,6,1,1,1,0,0,0
"1058",1581,7,"the provincial.
3. I have said all this in case someone else or Father Commissary may think otherwise. But I don't believe this will happen, for in his order the nuns in many places have confessors who are not their vicars. Our entire existence depends on our keeping out these wicked devotees, destroyers of the brides of Christ. It is necessary always to think of the worst that can happen in order to remove this occasion of sin, for the devil enters here without our realizing it. This is what can do us harm and that I always fear -- as well as our taking in too large a number of nuns. So I beg you to insist that these two things remain firmly fixed in our constitutions. Do me this favor.
4. I don't know why you say we should be silent in regard to the friars being our confessors, for you see how bound we are by the constitutions of Padre Fray Pedro Fernández, and I confess that it is necessary that we be so. Nor do I understand why you must not speak about matters concerning us. I tell you that I have so stressed in my letter the benefit we derive from your visitations -- and this is true -- that you can readily discuss anything you like in order to help us. You really owe this to these nuns, for you cost them many tears. I would prefer that no one speak of these matters but you and Padre Nicolao, for it is not necessary that our constitutions or that which you ordain for us be dealt with in the chapter or that the others be informed of them. Only between ourselves did Padre Fernández (may he be in glory) and I discuss these matters. And even though some of the eight things that I set down at the beginning seem unimportant, you should realize that they are very important. So, I would not want you to remove any of them. In what regards nuns I can have a say, for I have seen many things
5. You should know that I wanted to arrange to ask Father Prior and the commissary to appoint masters and presentados from those among you who are qualified. This is necessary for some matters and so as not to need to have recourse to the general. But since you say that the commissary has no further authority than to assist at the chapter and draw up constitutions, I let the",1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,10,0,11,8,2,2,2,14,5,10,12,10,2,7,0,0,1,0,0
"1059",1581,8,"matter go.
6. It seems they have not granted all that was asked for. It would have been good if they had and done away for some years with any need for us to have recourse to Rome. It will be necessary that you write at once to the general, giving him an account of what is taking place. The letter should be a humble one, submitting to him as his subjects, which is right. And you should write as well to Fray Angel -- for you owe it to him -- thanking him for the good things he has done for you and asking him to always consider you his son; and be sure to do this!
7. Now let us deal with what you say of your wish not to be elected or confirmed; in this regard I am writing to Father Commissary. You should know, mi padre, that regarding the desire I have had to see you free, I clearly understand that the love I have for you in the Lord is much more at work than the good of the order. From this proceeds a natural weakness that causes me to suffer greatly in seeing that not all understand how much they owe you and how much you have labored; I cannot bear to hear even a word spoken against you. But in considering what could result from this, I see that the general good carries more weight. If, however, Padre Nicolao were elected and then always accompanied by you, I think both wishes could be satisfied. But I truly believe that for this first time it would be better in all respects for you to hold the office, and so I am telling this to Father Commissary. And if this cannot be, then Padre Nicolao accompanied by you would be best because of your experience and knowledge of your subjects, both the friars and the nuns. I tell you that it is for his lack of experience that we consider Macario unsuited to the task. I am giving you good reasons for it all, and I tell you that Padre Fray Pedro Fernández thought this as well, although he did desire very much Macario's election for reasons valid at that time. But now -- the damage he would do!
8. I also included the name of Padre Fray Juan de Jesús so that it wouldn't seem that I am limiting myself to only two; although I told the truth in saying that Padre Juan de Jesús",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,4,3,0,3,17,0,0,2,14,7,19,8,11,3,4,1,0,1,1,1
"1060",1581,9,"didn't have the gift of governing -- since in my opinion he doesn't -- but that if he had one of the other two for his companion he could pass, for he listens to reason and would take counsel. And so I believe that if you went around with him, he would in no way distance himself from what you tell him; thus I believe he would do well. But I am sure he would not receive the votes. May God so direct things that whatever is for his greater honor and glory will come about, which is what I hope for, seeing that he has already done the greater part. It is a great pity ... 1. ... Give my best regards to Padre Fray Antonio and tell him that the letter I wrote him did not deserve to go unanswered and that since it seems I am speaking to a deaf-mute, I do not wish to write to him. He must be very happy to send Padre Mariano a share of his benefices. May this provide those fathers with more to eat than usual. I tell you that if a remedy for this state of affairs is not found everywhere, you will see where things will end up. One must not neglect to give orders in this regard, for God will never fail to provide what is necessary. If you give them little, he will give little ...
2. ... For the love of God, be sure that the beds are clean as well as the table napkins, no matter how much you spend, for it is a terrible thing if cleanliness is not provided. In fact I would like to see this prescribed in the constitutions, and I don't think doing that would even be enough, since ...
3. Oh, what distress these envelopes that address me as reverend cause me. I would like you to remove this title from all your subjects, seeing that it is not necessary in order to know who the letter is for. There is no reason, in my opinion, that among ourselves we be using words of honor that can be avoided ...
4. ... Insist on the use of the veil everywhere, for goodness' sake. Say that the discalced nuns themselves have asked for this, as is true, although there is recollection ...
5. ... Please God, mi padre, that these houses will not have the great misfortune of being deprived of your presence, for they need the kind of direction that",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,5,1,6,0,7,20,2,0,4,9,10,18,11,10,4,4,0,0,2,1,1
"1061",1581,10,"pays close attention to details and someone who understands everything. May His Majesty watch over them; they are your servants. 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with you, mi padre. I received the letter you wrote me from Alcalá and was delighted with all that you told me in it, especially that you are in good health. May God be praised, for he shows me great mercy after so many travels and so much work. I am well.
2. I have written to you by two different routes and sent my recommendations to give the appearance of being somebody. I had forgotten what I have now mentioned in the enclosed letter to Father Commissary. You may read it. So as not to tire myself by writing it out again I am sending you the letter without sealing it. Seal it with a seal that looks like mine, and give it to him.
3. The prioress of Segovia has reminded me of the freedom we have to invite preachers from outside the order. I had omitted this, thinking that it was already a given. But, mi padre, we must not consider those who are living at present, but at a later time some persons could come along who in being made superiors will oppose such freedom and many other things. So do us the favor to strive that this and what I wrote the other day be clearly understood and established through the commissary's authority. For if this isn't done, one will have to have recourse to Rome. I understand the great importance this has for these nuns and their consolation, and how disconsolate they become in other monasteries when held spiritually bound. Souls that are restrained cannot serve God well, and the devil uses this restraint to tempt them. But when they have some freedom, they often pay no attention to it and make no use of it.
4. If Father Commissary can amend the constitutions and add to them, I would like to see things removed and added in accordance with what we are now requesting. And no one will do this unless you and Padre Nicolao take it very much to heart. As you say and I believe I wrote in my letter to you, the friars should not have a say in our affairs, nor did Padre Fray Pedro Fernández give them any. Between the two of us we came to an agreement about the decrees he set down, and he didn't do anything without telling me",3,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,2,13,0,1,16,0,0,0,9,5,6,13,4,3,2,0,1,3,0,0
"1062",1581,11,"about it. I am grateful to him for this.
5. If it be possible to make new constitutions or remove and add, remember in regard to the ""stockings of rough wool or cloth made from rough tow"" that nothing be specified or said more than that they should wear stockings so that the nuns won't be having scruples. And where it says ""the toques should be made of fine tow"" say ""linen."" And if you think it appropriate, remove the decree made by Padre Fray Pedro Fernández where he says that they should not eat eggs or have bread for collation. I could never succeed in getting him not to do this. It is enough for the nuns to satisfy the obligation of the church without adding anything, for they become scrupulous and it does them harm. For some don't think they have a need when they do.
6. They have told us that the general chapter has now ordained many things about the prayers we recite and that we should have two ferias each week. If possible, put it down that we are not obliged to make so many changes, but that we can continue praying as we do now.
Also remember the many drawbacks to having discalced Carmelite friars living in one of the monasteries of the other Carmelites. If possible, say that when the discalced Carmelites have a place where they can stay in a completely edifying way, they don't have to reside in a monastery of the order.
7. Our constitutions say that our monasteries should be founded in poverty and not have an income. Since I now see that they are all on the way to having an income, consider if it would not be better to remove this and anything else in the constitutions that might refer to it so that no one on seeing them will think our monasteries have grown lax so quickly. Or, Father Commissary could say that since the council gives permission for an income, we should allow for one.
8. I would like to have these constitutions put into print, for different renderings of them are going about. There are prioresses who when copying them -- and without thinking they are doing anything wrong -- add or delete whatever they like. A strict, unmistakable precept should be set down against deleting or adding to the constitutions. In all these little things do what seems best to you, I mean in dealing with what concerns us. Also Padre Nicolao should be involved so",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,4,9,0,2,8,0,0,0,11,10,18,21,4,2,7,2,1,1,0,3
"1063",1581,12,"that it doesn't seem that you are doing this on your own; and even Padre Juan de Jesús, I believe, will consider kindly what concerns us. I would like to enlarge, but it's almost nightfall and they will be coming to get the letters, and I must still write to some friends.
9. I was deeply moved by what you promised to be for the discalced Carmelite nuns if elected provincial. At least you will be a true father, and they will certainly be grateful to you. And if you were to live for ever and they were to deal with no one else, there would be no need to be making some of these requests. How anxious they are for you to become provincial. I don't think anything else will satisfy them. May God watch over you for us. All the nuns ask for your prayers.
Today is 21 February.
Your paternity's true daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
10. They brought me the enclosed recommendations. When they send me the others, I will forward them. I don't know if they are acceptable, but it was indeed necessary for you to say that they should pass through my hands. May God keep you. Only the recommendation made by your friend Isabel de Santo Domingo was well done, and I am sending it as is. 1. Jesus be with your reverence, mi padre. I realize that you have little time now for reading letters. Please God I will know how to be brief with this.
2. Here are the recommendations that were lacking. You did well in saying that they should be sent here first along with the nuns' requests, for those from the nuns at St. Joseph's in Avila are such that there would be no longer a difference between them and the nuns at the Incarnation. I am frightened by what the devil is doing, and it is the confessor who is most to blame, despite his being so good. But he has always had it in his head that the nuns should eat meat, and this was one of the requests they made. Imagine that!
3. It has caused me much distress to see how that house has strayed and it will take a great deal of effort to get it to return to its true state, even though there are very good nuns in it. And to add to this, they are asking Father Provincial, Fray Angel, to allow some nuns who have poor health to keep something in their cells to eat.",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,17,0,5,18,3,1,0,11,8,12,13,10,2,2,1,2,1,0,2
"1064",1581,13,"And they are asking him in such a way that I wouldn't be surprised if he gave it to them. You can guess who encouraged them to ask Fray Angel! This is the way things get started, and little by little everything deteriorates. Such is the reason for the prescription at my request that superiors not be allowed to give the nuns permission to keep anything in their cells. It is necessary that this prescription have some force to it, even when a nun is sick. In that case the infirmarian can leave something at night for the one who has need. And there should be the greatest charity about this when the sickness calls for it.
4. I forgot to mention this, but others who have written reminded me: your chapter should decide on the prayers the friars should say for a nun when she dies. We will do the same, for they only recite prayers, and so far, I think, do not say Mass for us. What they do here is offer a sung Mass and an office for the dead recited by the community. I think this comes from the old constitutions, for this is what was done at the Incarnation.
5. Don't forget this. And also consider whether we have an obligation to observe the motu proprio that we not to go into the church, not even to lock the door. This is what should be done when possible, for it is the safest thing to do even if the pope hadn't given the orders. It is better that it be set down now, and where it is not possible because the house is just beginning that it be followed in the future. But I believe it will be followed in all our houses, for they now know that they must not do otherwise. Don't neglect to do this, for goodness' sake. In Toledo they have already locked the door that leads into the church, as well as in Segovia -- without even telling me -- and these two prioresses are servants of God and cautious. And since I am neither, I want them to keep me attentive. Well, this is done in all enclosed monasteries.
6. Regarding the request I made that those who set out for a new foundation remain there, unless they hold the office of prioress in their own house: the statement is too short. Do me the favor of adding ""or for some other important reason.""
7. I believe I have already asked",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,5,1,11,2,1,11,0,0,1,11,9,10,10,5,0,2,0,0,4,0,0
"1065",1581,14,"you to put the constitutions and all the acts of the apostolic visitators together, which would be good. For since the two make some contradictory statements in certain matters, the nuns who are less educated get confused. Although you have a lot to do, be careful, for the love of God, to take the time to make things plain and clear. Since I have written to you about this in so many letters, I fear lest you find yourself swamped in words and forget the better part.
8. Since you have not informed me of having received any of my letters, I have the temptation to think the devil has plotted to prevent the substance of my notes to reach you as well as the letters I wrote to Father Commissary. If this should be so, would you send me a private courier at once, and I will repay you, for it would be terrible if you didn't receive them. I truly believe this is a temptation because the courier here is a good friend of ours, and he recommended that the bundle be delivered with great care.
9. You should know I have been informed that some of those voting want Padre Macario to be elected. If God does this after so much prayer, it will be for the best; his judgments are his own. One of those who now tell me this was, from what I saw, inclined to vote for Padre Nicolao, and if they change they will vote for him. May God direct it all and watch over you. However badly things might go, what is essential at any rate has been accomplished. May he be praised forever.
10. I would like it if you wrote down on a separate piece of paper the important points of what I wrote you and burn my letters, for in the midst of all that confusion someone might chance upon one of them, and that would be terrible.
11. All the sisters here send their best regards, especially my companions.
Tomorrow is the last day of the month. I believe today is the 27th.
We are doing well here, and each day gets better. We have begun negotiations for a house in a very good location. I have been wanting to be free of my duties here so as not to be so far away.
12. See that you do not place any obstacle in the way of the foundation at St. Alexis. For the present, even though it may be a little far",2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,0,1,1,7,0,7,20,3,1,0,8,8,14,20,9,3,0,0,0,0,1,0
"1066",1581,15,"away, they will not find so good a site. It pleased me very much when I passed by there, and that woman paid with her tears. I would like this monastery to be the first, and then the one in Salamanca, for they are good places. They shouldn't think they can be choosy before making the foundation, for they don't have any money. Afterward God will provide. In Salamanca, houses are worth their weight in gold. We don't know what to do about finding one for the nuns. Believe me, for goodness' sake, for I have experience. And, as I say, God will bring everything to a good end. Even though you have only a little nook, it is important in a place like that to get started. May His Majesty bring everything to the conclusion necessary for his service, amen.
Your paternity's unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus
13. I would very much like to see this matter of St. Alexis attended to at once so that apart from the main reason for doing so you would be close by. But they cannot come until they have arranged to receive a license from the abbot. The bishop is on better terms with him, and his sister will give the guarantee. Tell those fathers for me that they ought to begin the negotiations, for if they spend a lot of time in the beginning looking for a good site, they will end up with nothing. 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. If I had written you as was my desire, I would not have waited for the favor of your letter before writing to you -- I would have written several letters by now. But I have had so many to write these days and so much business to tend to, along with the setting up of a province and my poor health, that I don't know how I kept my head.
2. Mother Prioress, María Bautista, has written me of your joy over the favor God has shown us in regard to our becoming a separate province. And it wasn't necessary for her to do so. I already know that even if this favor didn't concern those who are such servants of yours, it would be enough that it have to do with the service of God for you to be happy, since you belong to his house and kingdom. I tell you this favor has brought me great relief, for it seems we will have",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,6,12,0,1,20,0,0,1,12,5,12,8,5,2,1,1,1,1,0,1
"1067",1581,16,"peace from here on, which is a wonderful thing. And those who have begun this journey will not be impeded by having superiors so different from them, but they will have their own superiors who will understand what they must do. May he be blessed forever.
3. I don't know when I will be able to see that you have something that brings you happiness. It seems to me that God wants to hold everything back so that your happiness will be greater in that eternity that will have no end. And your poor health is not the least of your trials. Now, since the good weather is coming, perhaps you will feel some improvement. May the Lord bring this about as he can. Once that pain in my side left me, I have felt better, but I don't know how long this will last.
4. Here, things are going very well, and with each day one understands better how right it was to make this foundation here. The people are charitable and straightforward, without duplicity, which I like very much. And the bishop (God watch over him) is just right for us; it is unusual the way he favors us. I ask you to remember him at times in your prayers to our Lord.
5. You have honored us greatly with the statue you donated, which stands alone on the main altar, and it is so well-done and large that there is no need for others.
6. We brought a very good prioress here, and nuns that, in my opinion, are also very good. So, the house seems as though it was founded a good time ago. Nonetheless, regarding matters of the soul, I feel alone, for there is no one here that I know from the Society. Truly, I feel alone everywhere, because before, even when our saint was far away, it seems he was a companion to me, because he still communicated with me through letters. Well, we are in exile, and it is good that we feel this life to be one.
7. What do you think of how honorably Fray Domingo Báñez managed to receive his chair? May it please God to watch over him, for there aren't many left like him. There will be no lack of work with this, for it is a very costly honor.
8. I beg you to give Señora Doña María my best regards. I long to see her in good health, but my prayers are of no value except to add to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,5,13,0,4,29,0,0,3,15,9,4,10,4,4,0,5,0,4,0,0
"1068",1581,17,"people's trials. You can see for yourself whether this is not true.
9. I beg you to tell Padre García Manrique, if he is there, that I would like very much to have him here, and not to forget me in his prayers.
10. We never succeed in buying this house, and I certainly desire to do so, for if God be served, I would like to go to Burgos, since the good weather is coming, so as to return quickly and have more time to stay with you.
11. May His Majesty work this out, as he can, and give you much spiritual consolation during this holy time, since you are so far it seems from having any temporal consolation. I kiss the hands of Señor Don Luis. I beg God to make him very holy.
From this house of St. Joseph's. Today is 4 March.
Your unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus My brother, do not accept the position, for our Lord has made it known to me that should you accept it and die in it, you will be condemned.
  1. Jesus. The Holy Spirit be with your honor. The Lord did not want me to enjoy receiving your letter, because the reason for your sending it took away my happiness. May God be blessed for everything.
2. It is evident that the Lord is loved in that house since he is giving it trials in so many ways. When trials are born with such patience as they are there, he is enabled to give more favors. A great favor it is just to begin to understand what little attention should be paid to a life that continually manifests itself as perishable, and to understand how much the life that never ends should be loved and sought. May it please our Lord to give health to Señora Doña Luisa and Señor Don Juan; we are beseeching the Lord for this here.
3. When there is an improvement, I beg you to take away the sorrow that you have now given me. Ask Doña Isabel and Doña Catalina to pray for me. I beseech you to have courage so that you can in turn give it to Señora Doña Luisa. Surely, to stay longer in that place would be to tempt God.
4. May His Majesty guide you and give you all the good I both desire and ask of him for you, amen; and the same goes for Señora Doña Catalina.
Today is 22 October. I received your letter today.
Your honor's unworthy servant,

"1069",1581,18,"of Jesus 1. ... not to displease the prioress because her nuns are very much in accord, and she wouldn't want to introduce a note of discord. In Medina there are many melancholic nuns. But her presence would be disturbing anywhere; and I am not surprised. Although, in the end, the nuns are supposed to help one another, it doesn't seem appropriate for a foundation just beginning. I was thinking of bringing her to Burgos, not as foundress but as a penitent, for if God wills that a foundation be made there, I plan to leave Inés de Jesús as prioress. She would much prefer to go there than to Madrid, although she dislikes being prioress anywhere. And the subprioress in Valladolid can go as subprioress. This will be pleasing to them both. And, after all, these two know her and will proceed prudently, but Inés de Jesús will find it very difficult. For love of God, think of what might be the best solution, for it is necessary to prescribe a remedy at once before she's lost. She hasn't left her cell, nor would it be good if she did.
2. Because I believe you will have many things to do, I don't think it would be wise for me to go on at length, and for the same reason I have not allowed Mother Prioress to write to you. Carry on as though you have received that letter. She sends her best regards, and I send mine to Padre Mariano and all the others.
3. If you go to Madrid I would like you to do me the favor of going to see Don Francisco and his wife since he would not dare, being so timid, go to see you. He has written to me of how happy he is for having done what he did. You could encourage him in the service of God and not let it seem that because he gave up on being a friar you are disgusted with him. Because of poor management on his part, I think he is going to suffer a great loss, and I tell you that the marriage is not a good one. I would love to withdraw from all of them, but the mother-in-law has befriended me and is asking me things I am obliged to answer, which is very wearisome to me. But he was running the risk of total ruin because she learned that he was receiving an income of two thousand ducats. I told",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,2,7,0,11,14,3,1,5,14,13,14,9,5,2,0,0,0,1,2,0
"1070",1581,19,"her the truth so that they will be careful about what they are spending. Padre Fray Angel went to see them at once without my asking him, and so it will seem, as I say, ill-will on your part not to pay him a visit. May our Lord watch over you.
4. See that you do not fail to write me -- you know what a comfort your letters are for me -- and at length; tell me how Macario has been, and tear this letter up.
5. We have not yet managed to buy the house; we are in the process of doing so. I have brought two lay sisters without any other authorization than my patent letters -- for this is what I usually did so as not to have to ask someone who would be presiding for so short a time. I praise God greatly that he is as good as you say and has done everything so well.
Today is 12 March.
Your reverence's servant, daughter, and subject -- and how willingly!
Teresa of Jesus
6. I am doing well, except for the usual ailments. I cannot find Juliana's letter. It is all about her not wanting to return to the Incarnation, for she thinks it would amount to regressing. If she wrote, it is because she thought the prioress and I wanted her to return. There is no need to pay any attention to what she says. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I beg you to tell the one who delivers this letter how you fared last night and if you are very tired. I returned not tired but very happy, and the more I think about the house, the more convinced I am that the other one did not suit us because for our purposes only the courtyard was usable. And if the other little house is sold to us, the nuns will be able to live there well for many years; indeed, very well. I beg you then to try to get this little house. And if it is not for sale, see if they will rent it to us for a few years, since it would be needed by the woman who serves us.
2. You could tell Tamayo that to buy just his house you would have to pay more for it and that we wouldn't be able to pay for the two together except over a period of time. If you agree, it is better that he not",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,10,9,0,1,15,0,0,1,7,7,16,12,4,4,3,0,0,2,0,0
"1071",1581,20,"know that he displeased us but that he think that at some time in the future we will be able to buy his house. One of the sisters made the witty remark that in Holy Week the two will become friends again and that thus the purchase must be concluded at once.
3. The prioress and sisters kiss your hands for having found them so good a house. They are very happy and are right because everything is very suited to our needs. And it is a great thing for them to see that they will be able to expand by buying more land. It would be great if after Easter we could begin to tear down walls. May the Lord bring this about and watch over your honor as all the nuns beg of him.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your lordship. Although I have desired to write you a long letter, I have not been fortunate enough to find the time, even though the gentleman who brought your letter and came one day to see me did not fail to remind me. You favor me in every way. I have written you by a different route and believe you will by now have received the letter. At present there is nothing new except a further complication about a house which makes me fear I will have to stay here this summer.
2. Regarding the matter you wrote me about, even though it seems good for all of us, I don't know if I want to see you in the midst of the trials that accompany these things, which are terrible. Entrust it all to the Lord; His Majesty will guide you.
3. I am well; and it seems our affairs are going well. Please God, you will be well always. I am being so pressed to hurry that I cannot say more.
Today is Tuesday of Holy Week.
Your unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your paternity and reward you for the consolation you have given me with the information you sent, especially for letting me see the printed brief. All that was lacking for everything to be complete was to have the constitutions printed as well. God will provide, for I am well aware that the work must have been difficult for you. It could not have been easy to put all this in order. May he be blessed who gives you so much talent for",2,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,3,15,0,4,21,1,0,1,13,5,11,7,12,5,1,2,1,0,1,0
"1072",1581,21,"everything. This whole affair seems like a dream. For even though we would have had to think hard about what to do, we wouldn't have succeeded in doing anything as well as God has. May he be always praised for everything.
2. I still have hardly read anything, for I do not understand what is in Latin and have to wait both for a translator and until Holy Week is over. Yesterday, the Wednesday of Tenebrae, they gave me the things you sent. So as to have a head capable of assisting at these services, and since we are few, I did not dare push myself to do any more than read the letters. I would like to know where you are thinking of going after your stay in Madrid, for I will always need to know where you are in case something arises.
3. You should know that I have been looking for a house here, and still am, and nothing is found except very expensive ones, with a lot of defects. So, I think we will take the houses that are close to Our Lady despite the disadvantages. If the chapter gives some large corrals that are there, which with time we will have the means to buy, we can prepare a good vegetable garden. The church is built and endowed with two chaplancies. The price has been reduced four hundred ducats, and I believe they will reduce it further. I tell you that I am amazed by the virtue shown in this place. The people give much in alms, and since it will only be necessary that the nuns have enough to eat -- the expenses for the upkeep of the church being many -- I think it will be one of the best houses you have. By removing some upper galleries, they say the cloister will be brighter. As for rooms, there are more than necessary. May God be served there, and may he watch over you. This is not a day for me to go on at length, since it is Good Friday.
4. I forgot to ask you for something, as an Easter treat; please God you will do it. You should know that up until now in consoling Fray John of the Cross for the suffering he endures living in Andalusia (for he cannot bear those people), I told him that as soon as God let us become a separate province I would see to it that he got back up here. Now he",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,4,5,4,9,0,3,13,0,0,2,14,3,8,14,6,4,1,1,1,1,0,2
"1073",1581,22,"asks me to keep my word -- he is afraid they will elect him in Baeza. He wrote asking me to beg you not to confirm it. If this is something you can do, there is every reason to console him because he is tired of suffering. Certainly, mi padre, my desire is that there be only a few houses in Andalusia, for I think they will be harmful to those up here.
5. The prioress at San Alejo, they say, is mad with joy. Her dances and the things she does, they tell me, are charming, and all the discalced nuns here never end their rejoicing at having such a father. Their joy is complete. May God give us such joy in that place where it never ends, and may he give you a very happy Easter. Wish the same to those gentlemen for me, and they will have a happy one if you are there.
6. All the nuns send their best regards, especially my companions. The rest I will leave for my letter to Padre Nicolao. Oh, how delighted I am that you have such a good companion! I would like to know what happened to Padre Fray Bartolomé. He would make a good prior for a foundation.
Your reverence's daughter and subject,
Teresa of Jesus Now, my daughter, I can say what holy Simeon said, since I have seen in the order of the Blessed Virgin our Lady what I was desiring to see. So I ask and beg you not to pray or ask for me to live but that I may go to rest, for I am no longer of any usefulness. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I have received a letter from you and would have written you more often if I had paid heed to my desires. But the workload and business matters these past years were such that I had a hard time attending to everything. Glory to God who has brought us out of it all successfully.
2. As Mother Prioress will tell you, I praise God because you are so happy with the state in life that he has given you. May it please him that, since there are saints in that state just as there are in others, you will become one if you do not lose the opportunity through your own fault.
3. Any complaint that I might have against you in those other matters is that you did not let me know as",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,2,14,0,7,22,1,1,2,5,8,11,14,9,2,3,1,0,2,1,0
"1074",1581,23,"soon as you yourself knew. Perhaps we would have been able to avoid any negligence and prevent all the evil the devil brought about by making one believe that the evil was really there. And even if everything that woman imagined were true, being who she is, one would have had to behave differently and not engage in such unrestrained defamation. When God does the judging we will understand what we cannot judge here below without offending him greatly, for where such great friendship existed, and for so long a time, there was no reason, unless through malice, for such a heavy condemnation.
4. My sister's demeanor with everyone is so gentle that it doesn't seem she could be harsh with anyone, for she is gentle by nature. Nor have I ever seen in her daughter any rudeness of the kind that would make it necessary for my sister to be harsh, but only a great deal of calm. Truly, I have not seen them often, but I have shared a great part of the pain for the offenses that must have been committed before God by the one who so perverted the truth. My sister swears up and down that it is a calumny, and I believe it because my sister is not a liar, nor would anyone in that place have any reason to treat her badly. But her poverty is the reason they all hold her in so little esteem. God allows it that she might suffer in every way, for truly she is a martyr in this life. May God give her patience.
5. I tell you that if it were up to me, since it's a matter of calumny, I would remove the occasion. But I could at least help them through prayer, if my prayers were of any value. I am so wretched, however, that they do no more good than what you see. Nor was it any good for me to be your servant so that you would, as I said, tell me about this at once. When you say that I am no longer the way I used to be, I don't know what you can base this on, for nothing that concerns you fails to concern me, and I do with words what I cannot do with works -- speak of your merits -- and this is all true. You are the one who has drifted from me, in such a manner that it surprises me. The truth is, I don't",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,7,0,12,21,1,6,2,10,9,12,15,15,3,3,1,0,2,1,0
"1075",1581,24,"deserve any more.
6. Mother Prioress has written me that you said you had agreed with me on the dowry for that little angel they have in their house. If this is so, I don't remember anything more than that you told me that everything you had you wanted for her and that you could give her seven hundred ducats free of entailments. And I remember this because with the desire I had to serve you, I was delighted that the dowry would be so good that Father Visitator (who was then Padre Gracián) would want to give the permission. So I wrote to him, urging him as much as I could, for apart from Casilda and Teresita and Padre Gracián's little sister, no child has been received in these houses, nor would I consent to this. I no longer have the power in all the houses that I used to have, for the decisions are made by a community vote. According to the constitutions that have been drawn up, the habit cannot be given to anyone under twelve, nor can one make profession until the age of sixteen. So now the matter cannot even be considered.
7. Would you try to pay something on the cost for her food, for since you have other expenses, you cannot give whenever you want. They tell me that it is for I don't know how long that you haven't given them anything, and so they think that this is the way it will be with the dowry. Certainly if it were up to me I wouldn't bother you about this. May God give you the peace I desire, amen.
From St. Joseph's in Palencia on the last day of the Easter feast.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. After I wrote that letter, I spoke with Canon Salinas. He and Canon Rodríguez think that in order to take possession of the foundation, there would be no house more suitable than the one belonging to the Jesuits and that even by acquiring another house near it the nuns could for many reasons perhaps stay there. And they say that Señora Catalina de Tolosa and you are trying very hard for this because it doesn't matter to those lords, for if it did Padre Maestro Ripalda wouldn't offer it to me. It is very important for us to be granted this favor, even if we have to rent the house, for since you have been living in it for so long, it is not the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,7,5,7,0,1,11,0,1,0,8,10,19,11,3,0,3,1,0,1,0,1
"1076",1581,25,"fault of those fathers. They can think you gave it to us, if the nuns get established; although if we say that we plan to stay there only for a short time no one can complain. They say that once we are there the people in the area will get to know us better.
2. Well what is very important is that both of you in your charity do all you can. If those fathers mind, then I wouldn't want it.
3. If this becomes impossible, they say a house will be looked for in the San Juan quarter ... or at the gate of Santa Gadea. Anyway, it should be where there are people, for it could happen, they say, that after several years it still might not be known that a monastery is there.
4. It also seems that unless the nuns are living in that house where the Most Blessed Sacrament had been reserved, they should not have it reserved at once, and so a platform need not be made, for perhaps when they have their own house, a monstrance can be made. May the Lord direct all for his greater service. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I received your letter and spoke with Canon Salinas about the house you say belongs to Don Luis Osorio. And he says that it is located in a place where there is a lot of noise from the street and surrounded on all sides by vulgar people. If you have leased it, I have nothing more to say, and all we can do, as you state, is move in there. But if you have not, wait and don't take it until you see whether we can find another house in a neighborhood more suited to our way of life, especially if the houses of Francisco de Burgos or Agustín de Torquemada on the Calle de la Puebla, or others like them, are available; that would be great.
2. Because I am writing this in the speak room in the presence of Canon Salinas, I'll say no more than that the St. Joseph will not be made now until we see what will happen here. These sisters will finish this letter.
Today is the vigil of St. Mark.

I kiss the hands of Señora Catalina de Tolosa. To the very illustrious Señora Doña Luisa de la Cerda.
My lady in Paracuellos,
1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be with your ladyship. Since I have been in this house of the Incarnation -- a little over three weeks now -- I have written you three times. I don't think any of my letters has reached you. I share so much in your trials that when this suffering is added to the many I have here, I'm no longer worrying about asking our Lord for any more. May he be blessed for everything, for it truly seems that you are among those who will enjoy his kingdom since he gives you to drink from the chalice through so many illnesses, both your own and of those you love.
2. I once read in a book that the reward for trials is the love of God. For so precious a return, who will not love them? So I beg you to do so and to note how all things pass away quickly; journey by detaching yourself from everything that does not last forever.
3. I had already learned that you were ill, and so today I have tried in every way to learn about your health. May the Lord be blessed that you have improved. Come away from that region, for the love of God, for it is clearly bad for the health of all. My health is good -- may he be blessed -- compared to",2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,3,6,1,11,0,3,19,1,0,1,5,5,4,13,10,2,5,1,1,6,5,1
"1078",1581,27,"what it usually is. But with all the work I have, I wouldn't be able to hold up without better health than I usually have. My responsibilities are so many and so pressing, inside and outside the house, that I have little time even to write this.
4. May our Lord repay you for your kindness and the consolation your letter brought me, for I tell you that I need some of this. Oh, my lady, as one who has known the calm of our houses and now finds herself in the midst of this pandemonium, I don't know how one can go on living, for everywhere there is suffering. Nonetheless, glory to God, there is peace, which is no small thing. Gradually I am taking away the nuns' diversions and freedom, for even though these nuns are so good -- certainly there is much virtue in this house -- changing a habit is death, as they say. They bear it well and show me much respect. But where there are 130 nuns, you will understand the care that is necessary to keep things in order. I am somewhat concerned about our own monasteries; but since I was obliged to come here under obedience, I hope that our Lord will not allow me to fail in my duty, but that he will care for them. It doesn't seem that my soul is disturbed in the midst of this whole Babylon, which I take to be a favor from the Lord. Human nature grows tired, but it is all little next to my offenses against the Lord.
5. I was sorry to learn of the death of the good Doña Juana. May God take her to himself, and indeed he will, for she was most worthy. I really don't know why we should feel sorry about those who depart for a safe haven, whom God draws out of this world with its dangers and instability. We are loving ourselves rather than those who go to enjoy a greater good. I commend myself to the prayers of my ladies.
6. I tell you that I keep you ever present and that it was not necessary for you to awaken me with your letter; I would rather be half asleep than see myself so imperfect as to fail to be afflicted over your sufferings. May our Lord give you eternal happiness and rest because for some time now you have given up happiness and rest in this life, though you do not yet appreciate",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,3,0,14,2,8,23,1,2,3,9,7,7,11,7,1,1,1,1,4,0,0
"1079",1581,28,"the value of suffering. The day will come when you will understand what you have gained and that for nothing in the world should you ever want to lose it.
7. I'm very much consoled in knowing that my Padre Duarte is there. Now that I am not able to serve you, it brings me joy to know that you have so much good support to help you undergo your trials. The messenger is waiting, so I cannot go on any longer, save to kiss the hands of my ladies many times.
8. May our Lord lead you by his hand and take those fevers away quickly. May you be given the strength to please His Majesty in everything, as I beg of him, amen.
Written at the Incarnation in Avila, 7 November.
Your ladyship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, mi padre. Now do you see how short-lasting my happiness was? I was desiring to make this trip, and I believe I would have regretted to see it end, as happened at other times when I was in the company that I now thought would be mine. May God be praised, for already I seem to be growing tired. I tell you, mi padre, that, in the end, the flesh is weak and so has become sadder than I would want, for the sadness was great. Your departure could have been excused if you had stayed at least until seeing us move into our house, for eight days more or less didn't matter. There has been much loneliness here, and please God that he who was responsible for taking you away will act in a manner better than I fear he might. God deliver me from such urgency. And then he talks about us!
2. Truthfully, I have nothing good to say now, for I have little inclination to do so. The only comfort would be freedom from the fear that I could have, and have had, that they might touch me in what is my holy of holies. For I assure you the temptation I go through in this regard is a strong one. And in exchange for this not happening, I would suffer everything to come raining down on me -- and it is raining a lot now, so afflicted have I felt. Everything becomes very displeasing, for after all the soul suffers from not being with the one who governs and comforts it. May God be served through it",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,2,14,0,11,20,2,0,8,9,3,13,12,7,3,1,4,3,3,1,0
"1080",1581,29,"all, and if this be so, there is no reason to complain however painful it may be.
3. You should know that when you were here I put off discussing something with you until your return -- which would have given me more time to pray over the matter. It concerned something that Padre Juan Díaz urgently recommended to me. And I felt very sorry afterward when I learned that you are not returning, because he came here for no other reason. He has about decided to change his state and enter either our order or the Jesuits. He says that after being here for some days he is leaning more toward this order and wants to know your opinion and mine and asks that we pray for him.
4. What I feel about this and what I told him is that it would be very good for him if he were to persevere. If he didn't it will be harmful, bringing discredit to the publications with which he is engaged. And so I say this now, although I am a little less fearful of it, because he serves our Lord very much and in the end will have to overcome many things; but he will end up well if he settles down in one order. He says that he will give the monastery where he enters all that he has from Maestro Avila. In my opinion, if it is like the little that was given to me to read, the sermons would be of great benefit to people who are not as knowledgeable as you are. He is a man who is edifying no matter where he is. We should think carefully about this. I will speak of it with Padre Nicolao. I have mentioned it here to you so that if he has not yet spoken to you about it, you will do me the charity of letting him know that I spoke of the matter with you. He would have reason to complain about me if I hadn't. And will you pray about this. Since you know him better than I do, you will understand what the appropriate answer for him would be, and let me know if you find a means of doing so, since even this will present another difficulty.
5. Enclosed is a letter to me by the Bishop of Osma, and a paper that I wrote; I didn't have time for more.
6. In my opinion, your reverence did not have to go to Alba",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,7,0,7,9,1,0,0,18,8,16,16,2,0,6,2,0,1,0,0
"1081",1581,30,"without Padre Nicolao. He would have seen clearly into those intrigues and calculations about the alms left by the beneficiary. You did me a great favor by sending him (for no one could be better). You couldn't have sent some young lad, but it had to be someone who speaks and presents himself well. Oh, mi padre, praise be to God who made you so charming in the presence of those with whom you deal that no one seems to fill this void, for everything wearies poor Lorencia. She asks for your prayers. She says that there is no quiet or rest for her soul except in God and with anyone who understands her as you do. The rest is a cross for her beyond exaggeration.
7. San Bartolomé has been left very sad. She sends you her best regards. Give us your blessing and pray much for us to His Majesty.
May he watch over and guide you, amen.
8. You should know that there they also have a strange fear of the prioress and the custom of never saying anything about anything to the major superior. Regarding the students who serve them, you need to be careful. May God keep you.
Your reverence's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I received the papers and will do what you command. May our Lord repay you for the care you have shown. With my poor prayers, I will do what you ask, and so I beg you to keep me in yours, and do me the favor of telling his excellency, the duke, that my departure, God willing, will take place Monday. I am beseeching his excellency to see if he can render me some service, for he has so many things to do that I don't ask him for anything more, for which I kiss his hands. May our Lord guide him always.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. As for the main request that your honor makes, I cannot be of help in any way, and this because of our constitutions. The regulation, sought by me, is that no nun from another order is to be accepted into one of these houses. So many wanted, and want, to enter these houses that even though some were a consolation for us, there are many drawbacks to opening the door to this practice. So I have nothing more to say about this, for the desire I have to please you can",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,3,2,19,0,3,22,1,0,1,4,3,9,16,4,3,5,1,1,0,1,0
"1082",1581,31,"do or serve for nothing more than afflict me.
2. Before beginning to found these monasteries, I lived for twenty-five years in one where there were 180 nuns. And because I am in a hurry, I will only say that for anyone who loves God all those things will be a cross for her and of benefit to her soul, and they will not harm it if you keep in mind the advice that you and God alone are in that house, and as long as you do not have an office that obliges you to observe things, don't pay any attention to them, but strive to acquire the virtue that you see in each one, love her for that, benefit from it, and forget about the faults you see in her.
3. The benefit to me was such that even though there were so many nuns it mattered no more than if there were none; they were only an advantage for me. After all, my lady, we can love this great God everywhere. May he be blessed, for there is no one who can prevent us from doing this. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your most illustrious lordship. I have been waiting for an answer to a letter of mine that must have been delivered to you during Holy Week or a little after that, according to what I was told. In it I asked you to grant me the favor of a license to found a monastery in Madrid, which you had previously told me would please you. But you did not give me the license at the time because of a certain obstacle, which our Lord has now removed. I don't know whether you remember and how you told me that once the barrier were gone you would grant me this favor. Considering this to be certain, I have been preparing some things for this foundation, since it will be easier to find a less expensive house before his majesty comes to Madrid.
2. At present I am in Soria where a monastery has been founded. The bishop of this place invited me to come to found it, and it has been established very well for the glory of God. I would not want to leave this town until you grant me this favor, for otherwise I would have to travel many leagues out of my way. And as I told you, there are some persons in that city waiting and suffering",2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,2,18,0,4,20,0,0,2,9,6,8,10,6,2,1,0,0,0,3,0
"1083",1581,32,"from the delay. Since you always help those who seek to serve our Lord and from what I understand he will be served by this work which will be most beneficial for this order -- I beg you not to delay any longer the bestowal of this favor, if it would please you to do so.
3. My lady, Doña Elena, continues steadfast in her purpose. But until the license comes from you, this is of little use. She is so holy and detached from everything that they tell me she would like to enter the monastery in Madrid, with the hope truly of seeing you some day. I am not surprised.
4. I too always have this desire to see you, and I take special care each day to pray to our Lord for you and to have the nuns in these monasteries do the same.
5. May it please him to hear us and preserve you for very many years with the increase of holiness that I beg of him, amen.
Written in Soria in this house of the Carmel of the Holy Trinity on 16 June.
Your most illustrious lordship's unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of the Carmel of St. Joseph, Seville.
1. For goodness' sake do not rely much on that extra weight and take care of yourself. I recommend that Madre Juana de la Cruz watch that you do this, and Mother Subprioress, and San Francisco; and they should let me know if you don't.
2. Father Provincial has now given me again the authorization to do certain things. By that authority I command you to do what is necessary for the good of your health and whatever my dear Juana de la Cruz tells you to do, and both of you should report to me on how you are doing. Otherwise, for your penance I will not write to you.
3. For the time being we don't want your penances but that you do not give them to others with your illnesses and that you be obedient to me and not kill me. Truthfully I tell you I would not feel the loss of any prioress as much as I would losing you. I don't know how it is that I love you so much. 1. ... If it is necessary for me to go now to Avila and let the other project go, it would be let go forever, it seems. But it occurs to me that if I am prioress and Fray Gregorio is",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,12,1,3,17,0,1,2,5,6,14,12,9,3,1,2,0,2,1,1
"1084",1581,33,"there, I could be absent for a few months. I would greatly prefer having you nearby when this has to be decided. Please God this letter will go quickly, for you can answer me by way of Avila -- Padre Nicolao told me he would have a messenger sent -- and also by way of Palencia and Valladolid, for although the letters are slow in arriving, they write to me. Don't set aside one way for the other.
2. Please God you are well, for such bad lodging in this heat is a hard thing. I have envied your being near the river, though. It has always seemed to me that it would be a good place, at least so as to take possession of the foundation. Here it gets very hot at times, especially now as I am writing this. But the mornings and evenings are nice. All the nuns are well.
3. The prioress is carrying out her duties very well. As for this lady, she is extremely good. May God carry the work forward, for it seems that this foundation is a success, and may he watch over you for us, amen.
Today is 27 June. To the most illustrious Señor Licentiate Peña, confessor of the most illustrious Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo, my lord.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. The day after I sent a private messenger who had brought a letter for me from Señora Doña Luisa, they brought me your letter. I was very sorry because I would have wanted to answer at once and since there is no ordinary mail delivery in this place, I don't know when this letter will go out. I would have wanted it to go quickly so that you would be aware of how little I am at fault, or rather not at all, This is so true that out of respect for the relationship[3] of that person about whom you wrote to me with his illustrious lordship, I did not tell the latter about the efforts I made in this case to impede her entrance into one of these houses. If Padre Baltasar Alvarez, who was provincial of the Jesuits in this province, were alive, he would be a good witness to how I begged him to prevent such a thing, since this lady had more respect for him than for anyone else, and he promised to do so.
2. For some years now I have been standing in her way, and I don't",2,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,12,1,4,16,0,1,0,9,8,13,11,5,1,0,2,0,1,0,0
"1085",1581,34,"think this is because his illustrious lordship is opposed to her entering, but out of fear that what happened in the case of another lady who entered one of our monasteries, leaving daughters behind, might happen to us. This was done without my approval, for I was far away from that city when she entered. I tell you that ten years of unrest and great trials have gone by (for she entered that long ago), and she is a good servant of God. But since the order of charity, which is obligatory, is not being observed, I think God allows her and her daughters to pay for such a failure, and the nuns as well. And I have mentioned it so much in these monasteries that I am certain the prioress in Medina becomes upset every time she thinks of what might happen. Consider how although this is true, the devil has found a way in which they can accuse me of the opposite.
3. Our Lord often finds a way of granting me joy in suffering calumnies, which have not been rare for me in this life, but this one in a way has caused me distress. For if I owed his lordship gratitude for nothing else than his having allowed me to kiss his hands there, that would be enough, but how much more do I owe him for so many favors; and in the case of some he does not know that I am aware of them. And knowing what his will is in this regard, I couldn't give my consent now to such a thing, unless I were out of my mind. It is true that sometimes, since this lady cries so much when I tell her many things so as to dissuade her, I may at times have given her some reasons for hope while trying to cheer her up, and perhaps she thought I was in favor of this, although I don't especially remember such a thing.
4. I certainly love her honor very much, and am indebted to her, and so -- leaving aside what concerns us -- if for my sins what I am speaking of should happen, I strongly desire that she succeed in everything. Yesterday I was told by the prioress of this house (who is from the monastery in Medina, for she is the one with whom this lady frequently communicated) that she had been told by her that the vow she had made to enter contained the condition",2,5,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,4,11,0,8,19,3,0,3,13,10,7,11,6,0,1,1,1,1,2,0
"1086",1581,35,"that she would do so when she could and that if she were told it would be for the greater service of God that she not enter, she would renounce her desire. It seems to me that since she still has children to care for and her daughter-in-law is so young, she is not yet able to enter. If you think it appropriate, tell his lordship about this so that he will understand how the vow was made. Some learned men with whom she speaks disturb her, and the little they say to someone who is so holy is enough to do that.
5. If your letter had come before the one Señora Doña Luisa wrote me, in which she tells me that his lordship has been freed from any illusion about my being at fault in this matter, it would have pained me very much. Blessed be God who so favors me that without my understanding how his lordship has come to know the truth. Never in all my life would I have dreamed of excusing myself since I didn't think I was at fault. I kiss your honor's hands for having informed me of this. I consider it a special favor and consider myself newly obliged to serve you always more with my poor prayers, although up until now I have not failed to do so.
6. As regards the license for a foundation in Madrid, I have begged this of his most illustrious lordship because I think our Lord would be served thereby and because the discalced friars and nuns have urged me, for they say that it would be very useful for everyone to have a house there. But since his illustrious lordship stands in the place of God, I would feel no disturbance if he doesn't think it would be good to grant the permission. I would believe that accepting his denial would be of greater service to God, for I would not be refusing any trials; and I tell you there are many in every foundation.
7. What would be a great trial for me would be the thought that his illustrious lordship is displeased with me on account of calumnies uttered against me, for I love him tenderly in the Lord. And even if this doesn't matter to him, it is a consolation to me that he know the truth, for being loved doesn't matter to our Lord either, yet he is happy with this love alone. Truly, if love is present, it then",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,2,17,0,7,21,2,0,2,17,10,22,12,7,0,3,2,1,3,5,0
"1087",1581,36,"shows itself in works and in not departing from his will. Through these works I cannot serve his illustrious lordship in any better way than by refusing to oppose him as much as I can. Be certain of this, and do not forget me in your holy sacrifices, as we have agreed.
8. Since you will learn of my travel plans from the Mother Prioress there, I will not mention them. I have better health here than usual, glory to God. It is a great comfort to me to know that his illustrious lordship is in good health. May God give you health, and the holiness I beg of him for you, amen.
From this monastery of the Holy Trinity in Soria, the end of June.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, amen. I tell you that you are a real source of mortification. Do you think that because I am far away I have stopped both knowing what you are doing and feeling displeased about it? No, certainly not; rather it distresses me even more. For I am aware of the great consolation that those sisters receive from the kindness you show them and how consoled they are when they can go to confession to you. And so the prioress in writing to me is very distressed, and she is right.
2. For even though Father Provincial is there now and consoles them, not everyone will always be pleased to confess with just one. Nor should you worry about your happy spirit. I regret that I wasn't there at a time when I could have enjoyed your kind ways; I urgently entrust myself to your prayers. If Father Provincial approves, it is enough that I be a relative of yours for me to give you my highest approval, how much more so because of your other qualities.
3. Since I hear about you from the prioress, and you hear about me, and on account of my many duties -- it was restful for me there compared to what goes on here -- I do not write more often. But I will not forget you in my poor prayers, so I beg you to remember me in yours ... 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Not long ago I answered your letter, and since that letter will have to go from here by such roundabout ways, perhaps this one will arrive sooner.

"1088",1581,37,"myself to write to the cardinal so often, although I would be glad to do so, I wanted to write to beg you to tell him that after I wrote to his illustrious lordship, I spent some time with the prior at the house of Santo Domingo in this city, who is Fray Diego de Alderete. We spoke a long while about the matter concerning Señora Doña Elena. I told him that when I had finished my visit with her there a short time ago she was more scrupulous than ever about realizing her desire.
2. He had no more desire than I -- and I can't stress enough that I am opposed -- that she carry out her wishes. Listening to the reasons that I presented to him about the dissipation that could result, of a kind that really frightens me, he concluded that it would be much better for her to remain at home. He pointed out that since we do not want to receive her, she is freed from her vow; the vow was to enter this order and she is not obliged to anything more than to request this. That fact was a great consolation to me because I hadn't known about this.
3. He lives in this city where for eight years he has enjoyed the fame of being a very holy and learned man, and so he seemed to me. The penance he does is great. I had never met him, and so it consoled me greatly to come to know him. It is his opinion in this case that since I am so determined -- and that whole house as well -- not to receive her, we could inform her that she could never be accepted, and that should appease her. For if this drags on with many words, as has happened up until now, she will always go about disquieted. And truly it does not contribute anything to the service of God for her to abandon her children, as Father Prior agreed. But he told me that he had learned that she had received the approval of a theologian so renowned that he did not dare contradict him. His lordship can now be at ease about this matter.
4. I have given notice that even if his lordship grants the permission, she should not be received, and I will inform the provincial. You could tell his lordship whatever in this letter you think will not tire him, and kiss his hands for me.",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,1,8,0,4,13,2,1,1,14,6,15,8,6,0,2,1,1,1,1,0
"1089",1581,38,"May God keep your honor for many years and give you as much of his love as I desire and beseech of him.
From Soria, 8 July.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your honor. It seems as though you are in another world, living far off in that place. God deliver me from it and from this place as well, for almost from the time of my arrival I've had poor health. So as not to be telling you about this, I've preferred not to write. Before Christmas I suffered from fevers and a sore throat, and was bled and purged twice. Since before Epiphany I've been down with the quartan fevers, but I've not experienced any nausea; and on days when I've been free of them, I've been able to go to choir with the others and sometimes to the refectory. I don't think the fevers will last. Since I see the improvement the Lord has brought about in this house, I try not to stay in bed except when I have the fever, which lasts all night. The chills begin about two, but they are not excessive. Everything else is going well, with so many duties and troubles that I wonder how I'm able to bear them all. The biggest burden is letter-writing. I have written four times to the Indies, for the fleet is leaving.
2. I'm amazed by your indifference in seeing me with so many trials. I've been waiting each day for Señor Juan de Ovalle, who, I'm told, will be passing through here on his way to Madrid, for it is important to send my brother what he has requested. Now it's too late, nor do I know what to say. Everything should be easy for you; certainly it will not look well.
3. I've been told that Señor Juan de Ovalle and Señor Gonzalo de Ovalle are those who oppose giving a narrow passageway to the monastery. I can't believe it. I wouldn't want us to become involved in haggling. This doesn't look right for women, even though there may be a reason, and those lords would be greatly discredited, especially since the matter pertains to me. Furthermore, I don't think the nuns were aware of the reason; at least one should not turn their simplicity into a fault. Would you inform me about what is going on, for, as I say, this is the news that reached me, and it could be incorrect. Do not be sorry about my",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,2,2,9,0,5,14,0,0,1,12,6,9,10,5,4,3,0,1,9,1,0
"1090",1581,39,"illness, for I don't think it will amount to anything; at least it is not interfering much with my duties, even though it does cost me somewhat.
4. I miss you here very much, and I find myself alone. I need some reales, for I don't take any food from the monastery provisions except bread; try to send me some. I kiss the hands of those lords and of Beatriz. I would be very happy to have her here. I already know that Gonzalo is well. May God watch over him. Agustín de Ahumada is with the viceroy; Fray García has written me about it. My brother has arranged marriages for two of his nieces -- and very good ones at that. They will be secure on his departure. The clock will soon strike twelve and I'm very tired so -- no more.
Yesterday was the feast of St. Blase; the day before, of our Lady.
Your honor's devoted servant,
Teresa of Jesus Most Honorable Lords:
1. Since we received information that the little hermitages constructed on our property would cause no damage to the city's water ways, and the need was very great, we never thought your honors would be disturbed. What we did only serves for God's praise and provides us with a place apart for prayer, for it's in these hermitages that we beg God in a special way to preserve this city in his service.
2. Aware that your honors are displeased -- which distresses us all -- we beg you to come and see. We are prepared to comply with all the documents, promises, and pledges your lawyers might require so as to be sure that no damage will be done at any time; and we have always resolved to act in this way.
3. If despite this your honors are not satisfied and want the hermitages removed, may you first consider the benefit and not the harm that may come from them. What we want most to avoid is that you be displeased. We would be distressed if we had to go without the consolation we find in them, for it is spiritual.
4. May our Lord keep and preserve you, most honorable gentlemen, in his service, amen.
Your unworthy servants who respectfully kiss your hands,
The poor sisters of San José To our Father Provincial of the discalced Carmelites, Valladolid.
1. Jesus. The Holy Spirit be with your reverence, mi padre. I received a letter of yours dated the feast of St. John and afterward the one that came with Padre Nicolao's.",1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,6,0,0,2,15,0,9,21,4,0,4,9,3,10,16,5,2,0,2,2,2,2,3
"1091",1581,40,"One very long one that you said you wrote me never arrived here. But even though these were short, the happiness they brought me in informing me of your good health was not small, for I was worried. May he, as he can, give you health.
2. I have written you some letters. I wouldn't want the one to get lost where I begged you not to give permission to Doña Elena to become a nun. Now they tell me this messenger for Valladolid, where according to what you say I think you will be, is a very safe one. Since you will be there so close to San Alejo, I thought of sending you these letters from Toledo so that you may see how upset the archbishop is over it, and I do not want us in any way to have him for an enemy. And apart from this, never is there talk about her entering that I do not feel great resistance. For where mother and daughter and other relatives are present, along with what is known about this woman, I fear there will be much disquiet and that she won't be very happy. And so even before I spoke to the archbishop, I had asked Padre Baltasar Alvarez to prevent it, and he promised to do so, for he agreed with me, and he knew her very well. See how it can seem that I persuaded her. I have written to the cardinal that I will inform you, and not to worry, for she will not be received, and that I would be very distressed if her entrance were not prevented.
3. You realize how secret the contents of this letter must be. In any case, tear it up so that no one thinks that it is because of him that we are not accepting her, but that it is because it would not be opportune either for her or for her children, as is true. We already have a lot of experience with these widows.
4. Before I forget, I am afraid that these constitutions are never going to get printed. For goodness' sake do not neglect to do this; see how important it is. By now we could have had a large volume of history published.
5. Now let's take up Burgos. I am enclosing the response, and I am surprised by those who think I can just get up and go there. In my answer to the bishop, I told him that because of my illnesses",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,9,14,6,1,2,15,9,8,9,5,3,3,1,0,3,0,0
"1092",1581,41,"you ordered me not to go to Burgos at a time in which I would have to be there in winter -- you once wrote this to me. This I did so as not to put in doubt the archbishop's intentions and cause hostilities between him and the Bishop of Palencia, something to be avoided. After writing to the Bishop of Palencia, I wrote to the Archbishop of Burgos that because I thought I would be a bother to him if the city did not grant the license -- since I thought they would pay little attention to me -- I would let the project go until the city authorized it. The hour for this foundation must not have arrived. I think that Fray Baltasar's hour arrived first; so goes the world.
6. A foundation in Madrid is what would now be fitting, and I believe that when the archbishop sees that what he wants is being done, he will authorize it quickly. The bishop here, who is going there in September, tells me that he will give his support. I will be finished here, with God's help, in the middle of August. After the feast of Our Lady, if it appears all right to you, I will be able to go to Avila -- for it doesn't seem to me that those sisters spoke clearly with Padre Nicolao -- for here I have nothing to do. But if there is no big need, it would give me great consolation not to have to remain as prioress, for I am no longer fit for the task. It requires more energy than I have and makes me feel scrupulous.
7. If Padre Fray Gregorio Nacianceno remains there, as I wrote to you, the prioress will suffice since there is no one else there. And although I say ""will suffice,"" I think I am lying because I don't think there is anyone who can handle the internal affairs of the house. You will see what is best there. The concern I have for that house enables me to give little importance to whatever labor I would have to undergo so as to overcome its difficulties, and the fact that I will be waiting there for the Lord to open the way to a foundation in Madrid will be of some help. But one's human nature will not fail to feel in that place the absence of my brother and friends, and what is worse the presence of the ones who have remained.

"1093",1581,42,"As for the trip to Rome, I now see that it is very necessary, although there is nothing to fear in going to give obedience to the general. And because of the risk of the journey and our need, I would like to see friars sent who would not be missed so much if anything were to happen. You would certainly miss Padre Nicolao a great deal, although he would be the one who could best smooth everything over. I think that if from time to time you give to the general signs of our obedience and respectfulness there will be no problem. This is very necessary so that he understand that you are his subjects and that you all realize that you have a superior. Things must not be as in the past, nor the expenses, for this would be a burden for all the houses.
9. I forgot to mention the joy the agreement about the chapel brought me, for it is very well done. Glory to God, some benefit came from delaying.
With that daughter of the Flemish woman, I fear that you will have work for a whole lifetime, as you do with her mother; and please God she won't be worse. Believe me I fear an unhappy nun more than many devils. God pardon the one who took her back. Do not give permission for her profession until I come there, if God desires. I am writing Padre Nicolao to let me know if they have equipment there for travel, for I don't see much here. May God dispose everything for his greater service.
10. Please God you have been able to do something in that matter concerning Beatriz. For some days I have been afflicted over it. I have written a number of letters to her and her mother telling them terrible things that should have been enough for them to make some amends. For although they were without fault, I set before them the dangers that before God and the world they could have gotten into. In my opinion, though, they are not exempt, and the parents are more to blame because they allow her to give them orders. It's a lost cause, and I believe that if they do not remove the occasion completely, things will go from bad to worse, if such is possible, for they are bad enough now.

12. The bishop is leaving here within ten days for the synod. The foundress asks me to give you her best regards; consider them received along with those from all the others, for I am tired -- although well.

Teresa of Jesus
If Padre Nicolao is not there, read the letter that is enclosed for him. 1. I am delighted that things in Andalusia have gone so well, although it will still be necessary that you make the visitations there this winter when the pestilence is completely gone. I am delighted to know that according to what Casademonte writes me it is already gone.
2. You wouldn't believe how much I desire to send you a lot of money, because you have so little, and truly everyone should come to the help of that house because it will be so beneficial for the order. I have been devising different schemes; I don't know what I'll come up with. I don't think it will be much.
3. It's very hot here. Be careful not to get absorbed in overseeing the work, because the sun is now beginning to burn ...

Your reverence's servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I arrived here in Segovia on the eve of St. Bartholomew feeling well, glory to God, although very tired because the road was bad. So I will stay here six or seven days to rest, and then, if the Lord be served, I will leave for Avila.

He could come to see me on another day. Beg him to let you come and let him take this letter as being addressed also to him. Since this messenger has to leave at once, I am not writing him directly. I greatly desire that he grant me this favor, for you can come and stay with Pedro de Ahumada, and I will pay the round-trip traveling expense for the animals. Perhaps I will have to go far away again, and in no manner would I want to do so without seeing you.
3. Because I trust you won't do otherwise, I'll be waiting for you to come some time before the feast of our Lady.

5. Because I hope in God that we will see each other soon, I'll say no more. Give my best regards to Señora Doña Mayor and to whomever else you think it opportune to do so. For Mother Prioress of the discalced Carmelite nuns, behind San Francisco in Seville.
1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. I arrived last night, 4 September, in this town of Villacastín, really tired of traveling, for I am coming from the foundation in Soria on my way to Avila, with more than forty leagues to go. We got into many troubles and dangers. Despite everything, I am well, glory to God, and that new monastery is going well also. May God be pleased to make use of all the suffering, for that makes it worthwhile.
2. When he saw that everything was ready for my departure, Padre Acacio García came to the inn here to see me -- for Sister San Francisco knows him well -- and said that he had a reliable messenger. I am now writing these lines so that my daughters will have news of me.
3. I am very happy to learn that the pestilence is gone and that you are all well. The Lord shows his love for you. Our Father is also well; he is in Salamanca. Padre Nicolao is awaiting me in Avila, for",2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,1,2,11,0,3,20,0,1,1,3,8,6,9,6,9,2,1,0,1,1,0
"1096",1581,45,"he is going to Rome (which I am very sorry about) to get better confirmation of our affairs, for the king has desired this. He has been sick with typhus fever, but now is well. Pray fervently for him, for everyone owes this to him.
4. My daughter: the two hundred ducats have not reached me. They tell me that Señor Horacio de Oria has them. If that is so, they are in good hands. I have already told you to send them to me by way of Medina. I would now like to begin the chapel for my brother -- God give him glory -- for this is on my conscience. Would you give orders that they be sent to me, for otherwise I cannot take them into account.
5. May our Lord watch over you and all the nuns for me, and make you all as holy as I beg of him, amen, amen and allow me to see you.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I am now in Avila, mi padre, where I would most willingly be your daughter again if you were here, for I feel very much alone in this city where I find no one who can console me in my present situation. May God provide a remedy. The more I go on, the less I find in this life that can provide consolation.
2. I was not well when I arrived here, but had a slight fever caused by a certain circumstance. Now I am well, and it seems the body is relieved for not having to go on another trip so soon. For I tell you, these trips are very tiring, although I can't say that about the one from here to Soria. That trip was recreation for me, it being a smooth journey, often with a view of rivers that provided pleasant company. Our good procurator will have told you about this experience.
3. It's a strange thing that not one of those who desire to do me a favor escapes without a good deal of trouble, but God gives them the charity to enjoy it, as he has done with you. See that you do not fail to write me a letter when you have a messenger, even though you may find it tiring to do so, for I tell you there is very little in which to find rest, and many trials.

5. I kiss Don Francisco's hands. May our Lord watch over you with an increase in holiness, as I beg of him, amen.
Today is 9 September.
Your honor's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, and may His Majesty repay you for the kindness you showed me with your letter and the consolation it brought. I received it while in Soria. Now I am in Avila where Father Provincial sent me to stay until, our Lord be pleased, the cardinal gives us permission to make a foundation in Madrid. It would be a very long time for me to have to wait until his illustrious lordship goes to Madrid, for since he has to convoke the bishops in Toledo, I think Lent will go by first. So I am trusting that he will do me this favor beforehand, if for no other reason than to prevent me from having to spend the winter in such severe weather as one finds here in Avila, for it usually does me much harm. I beg you not to forget to remind him from time to time. In the letter he wrote to me in Soria, he did not expand on the matter.
2. Now I am writing him about this affair concerning Señora Doña Elena, which causes me much grief, and I am sending him a letter that she wrote me, for from what she says, if we do not receive her in this order, she wants to go to the Franciscans. I am very disturbed, for she will never be happy there from what I understand of her spirit, which is more suited to our order. And, after all, her own daughter is here and she is near her children.
3. I beg you to pray for this and try to get his illustrious lordship to answer me, for she is most distressed, and since I love her so much, I feel very sad about it and don't know what to do for her.
4. This is meant for you alone. May our Lord watch over you with the increase of holiness that I beg of him for you.
Written in St. Joseph's on 13 September.

"1098",1581,47,"1. Jesus be with your reverence, mi padre. I have also written you by way of Toledo. Today they brought me this letter from Valladolid with news that at first really astounded me. But then I reflected that God's ways are great and that after all he loves this order and will draw some good from what happened or prevent some evil of which we are not aware. For love of our Lord, don't be distressed.
2. I feel very sorry for the poor girl. She is the worse off, for it is nonsense to think that the one who went about with such joy is now unhappy. His Majesty must not want us to be receiving honor through the lords of the earth but through those who are little and poor, as were the apostles. So there is no need to pay any attention to the matter. And since they also got the other daughter to leave Santa Catalina de Sena along with her, nothing will be lost here; I mean as far as the worldly criticism goes, for with respect to God, as I say, perhaps it is better that we keep our eyes on him alone. May she go with God.
3. May he deliver me from these all-powerful lords with their strange reversals! Even though that poor little thing did not understand, I don't think it would be good for us if she were to return to the order. If there is something bad, it is the harm that things like this can do us when we are still in our beginning stages. That her unhappiness was as great as is that of the sister who is here does not surprise me. But I would consider it impossible for her to have hidden her unhappiness for so long a time if it were so.
4. This intrigue must have begun when the subprioress of Palencia began to disagree with the prioress in Valladolid. The confessor was a Jesuit father, a very good friend of María de Acuña's, and I learned that he counseled the sisters not to vote for anyone but the prioress, because the subprioress was at odds with Doña María de Acuña. And since Doña Casilda had not renounced her inheritance and Doña María wanted it for a school, everything would have perhaps worked together toward that end; although if they had seen that Casilda was happy, I don't think they would have done it. God deliver us from all this conniving.

"1099",1581,48,"don't think it would be fitting for us to change in our attitude toward members of the Society. For many reasons this would not be good for us to do, and one of the reasons is that most of the nuns who come here do so through them, and if aspirants were to think they ought not consult with the Jesuit fathers, they wouldn't be coming to us anymore. But it will be a great thing to have our own fathers, because we can then detach ourselves little by little from the others. May God give you light, for since this messenger has to leave now, I'll say no more.
6. Your crucifix was left here and I don't know how to send it so that it won't break. Take another one from the nuns in Toledo, and we will send them this one from here. I feel sorry for what that poor prioress is going through and for our María de San José. You should write to her. I am certainly very sorry to see you go so far away now; I don't know what has happened to me. May God accompany you with blessings, and give my regards to Padre Nicolao. All the nuns here send their regards to you and him.
Today is 17 September.

Teresa of Jesus
7. Doña María de Acuña wrote to the prioress begging her many times for pardon and stating that she wasn't able to do more and that the prioress should figure out what she owes the community for their having provided food for her daughter. She is thinking of keeping the inheritance, and for this reason they must allege a reason why the profession was made before time. Since they had a brief from the pope, I don't know how she can say this. I pity poor Casilda, because her love for the order was so great. I don't know what demon got into her. May God be with her. To the very illustrious Señor Don Sancho Dávila, in Alba.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor always. It was a great favor and gift for me to have a letter from you. Yet, since I had been hoping for a visit from you one of these days and I now see that I won't be able to have that joy, the happiness your letter brought me is somewhat diluted. I have praised our Lord and have considered what you hold to be a",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,5,17,0,3,14,0,0,1,14,14,9,8,4,2,2,1,0,0,1,1
"1100",1581,49,"loss a great favor from him, for no benefit could come to a soul, or health, from such extreme suffering. So you can thank His Majesty, for in taking it away he did not take from her the possibility of serving our Lord, which is what is most important. You do not feel within you that great determination not to offend him, but when the occasion arises to serve him and to reject what could be for you an occasion to displease him you find you are strong -- that is the authentic sign of a true desire, in my opinion. And that you are happy to receive the most Blessed Sacrament each day and feel sorry when you do not is the sign of a close friendship, and not as common as you think. Always consider the favors you receive from his hand as given for the purpose of growing in his love, and stop going about looking for all the little subtleties of your miseries, for these show themselves to everyone en masse, very much so, especially with me.
2. In regard to being distracted during the recitation of the divine office, although I am perhaps much at fault, I like to think it is due to a weakness of the head. And you should think the same, for the Lord knows well that when we pray we would like to pray very well. Today I confessed this to Padre Maestro Fray Domingo, and he told me not to pay attention to it, and I beg of you the same, for I consider it an incurable evil.
3. Your trouble with your teeth makes me feel very sorry, for I have had much experience with how painful that can be. If one is infected, it usually seems that they all are -- I mean that all hurt. I have not found a better remedy than having it pulled, although that doesn't help if the pain is caused by neuralgia. May God take away the pain as I will beg of him.
4. You did very well to write the life of so holy a person. I would be a good witness to the truth of her holiness. I kiss your hands for what you do for me in allowing me to see it.
5. I am getting along better. Compared to last year, I can say that I am well, although not much time goes by that I am not suffering something; and since I see that as long as",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,10,0,17,26,2,2,6,16,6,8,12,6,3,1,5,5,7,2,0

6. I would like to know if the marquis is there, and to receive some news about Señora Doña Juana de Toledo, his daughter, and about how the marquess is. I beg you to tell them that even though I have gone far away, I do not forget to remember them to our Lord in my poor prayers. I don't do much for your honor since you are my father and lord.
7. I kiss your hands for assuring me that you will be so for me if I need to ask you for help; and I want to do so. Because I am so confident that you will help me, if you see that it is fitting, I want to tell you alone of a great sorrow that I have been bearing for almost a year. It could be that you might be able to provide some remedy. I truly believe that you will know -- for they tell me that, for my sins, it is something public -- about the great jealousy of Don Gonzalo's wife. They have told her, and she takes it to be true, that her husband is involved in a wicked friendship with Doña Beatriz, my sister's daughter. And she says and asserts this so publicly that the majority of the people believe her. And so, with respect to the young girl's honor, it must now be so lost that there is no point for me to even consider it, but I am concerned about the many offenses committed against God. I am extremely sorry that a relative of mine should be the occasion for this, and so I have arranged with her parents to have her move away from there, for some learned men have told me the parents have an obligation to do this. And even if they didn't, it seems to me it would be wise to flee as from a wild animal the tongue of a woman inflamed with jealousy. Others tell the family that doing so would make a lie appear to be true, and that they shouldn't move. They tell me that the husband and wife are separated. I see that there is already talk about it by the wife's sister here in Avila, and many calumnies are being spread by those doing the talking. And the talk has extended even to Salamanca. The evil is spreading and neither from one side nor from the other is",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,5,0,11,15,0,5,4,8,4,14,12,8,2,1,1,2,1,1,0
"1102",1581,51,"any remedy being applied. Her parents pay no attention to the things I tell them -- which are not a few -- but say I am being deceived.
8. I beg you to write me and let me know what I should do so that these offenses against God may stop, for as I say, it would be hard now to salvage her honor in the people's opinion. I had thought of a means, but I would find it hard to put into effect. If you have any dealings with that Don Gonzalo, perhaps you could convince him to leave that place for maybe a year or a half year until his wife returns to normal, since he has a good residence elsewhere and sees the harm that is being done to this girl because of him. And in the meanwhile perhaps the Lord will so arrange that by the time he returns the girl will no longer be there. For without this, the way things are going -- and what there is now is already bad -- I fear some great evil will arise.
9. I beg you, if you see any way in which you can help me, to take this trial from me. May our Lord do so as he can, and may he give you the holiness that I beg of him for you, amen.
Today is 9 October.

10. I beg you to give greetings for me to Don Fadrique and to my lady Doña María, for my head is in no condition to write to them, and pardon me out of love for God. 1. Jesus be with your honor. It seems as though you are in another world, living far off in that place. God deliver me from it and from this place as well, for almost from the time of my arrival I've had poor health. So as not to be telling you about this, I've preferred not to write. Before Christmas I suffered from fevers and a sore throat, and was bled and purged twice. Since before Epiphany I've been down with the quartan fevers, but I've not experienced any nausea; and on days when I've been free of them, I've been able to go to choir with the others and sometimes to the refectory. I don't think the fevers will last. Since I see the improvement the Lord has brought about in this house, I try not to stay in bed except when I have",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,3,3,10,0,6,10,1,2,1,9,5,8,18,0,3,3,2,2,7,1,0
"1103",1581,52,"the fever, which lasts all night. The chills begin about two, but they are not excessive. Everything else is going well, with so many duties and troubles that I wonder how I'm able to bear them all. The biggest burden is letter-writing. I have written four times to the Indies, for the fleet is leaving.
2. I'm amazed by your indifference in seeing me with so many trials. I've been waiting each day for Señor Juan de Ovalle, who, I'm told, will be passing through here on his way to Madrid, for it is important to send my brother what he has requested. Now it's too late, nor do I know what to say. Everything should be easy for you; certainly it will not look well.
3. I've been told that Señor Juan de Ovalle and Señor Gonzalo de Ovalle are those who oppose giving a narrow passageway to the monastery. I can't believe it. I wouldn't want us to become involved in haggling. This doesn't look right for women, even though there may be a reason, and those lords would be greatly discredited, especially since the matter pertains to me. Furthermore, I don't think the nuns were aware of the reason; at least one should not turn their simplicity into a fault. Would you inform me about what is going on, for, as I say, this is the news that reached me, and it could be incorrect. Do not be sorry about my illness, for I don't think it will amount to anything; at least it is not interfering much with my duties, even though it does cost me somewhat.
4. I miss you here very much, and I find myself alone. I need some reales, for I don't take any food from the monastery provisions except bread; try to send me some. I kiss the hands of those lords and of Beatriz. I would be very happy to have her here. I already know that Gonzalo is well. May God watch over him. Agustín de Ahumada is with the viceroy; Fray García has written me about it. My brother has arranged marriages for two of his nieces -- and very good ones at that. They will be secure on his departure. The clock will soon strike twelve and I'm very tired so -- no more.
Yesterday was the feast of St. Blase; the day before, of our Lady.

"1104",1581,53,"makes me feel to have had no word of you for so long a time, it's painful for me not to know where you are. If something were to arise in which I would need your advice, this would cause problems, but even apart from that, such ignorance is hard for me to bear. Please God you are well. I am well and have become a grand prioress, as if I didn't have anything else to attend to. The notebooks are now done, and all the nuns are happy with them.
2. You should know that I told Ana de San Pedro's daughter that she should not consider herself a tacitly professed nun. She saw that I was determined that she should not make profession except in the mitigated rule, but that afterward she could stay here, for this was the agreement her mother and I came to; and that she would give a dowry here and another one at the Incarnation. The one who insisted most that she was not suited for here was her mother. The daughter felt this very much and says that she is willing for them to test her as many years as they want and that she will accept the confessors that they give her and that after that, if they want to send her away, she will leave willingly. Well, we have seen a turnabout that has amazed us all, although it hasn't been going on for long, not more than fifteen days.
3. All her trials of soul have disappeared and she goes about most joyfully. She is clearly happy and in good health. If this continues, one couldn't in conscience refuse her profession. I inquired of her and of her confessors and I am told that these anxieties were not normal for her, that she hadn't had them for more than a year and a half. Here they had given me to believe that she had always felt them, but I had never been here when she did. It seems also that she is more open. In your charity pray for her. Sometimes I have wondered if it isn't the devil who is making her wise, without all those anxieties, so as to deceive us and leave us afterward tormented by both her and her mother, although the mother is conducting herself well now. Her mother liked the idea about the Incarnation, and so did I.
4. The daughter would like to nullify the contract and give more to this monastery, and",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,9,0,6,18,2,0,0,16,4,19,12,7,2,1,4,0,2,0,0
"1105",1581,54,"she asked me to allow her to speak to Doctor Castro; yet she didn't tell me why, but he told me. And he looked at the contract and says that it is very tightly drawn up. She asked for his opinion, and he didn't want to give it, but he told her that he was a friend both of the Theatines and of this house also and that he was on good terms with both, that she should ask someone else. I told him that there was no need to get into this, for we would not take her for the sake of her fortune but only if she were suited for the life here; nor would we send her away for such a reason if she were doing well. The truth is that I spoke with reserve.
5. Tell me who this man is and if he can be trusted, for his intelligence, charm, and manner of speech please me very much. I don't know whether that may be due to the fact that he is so close to you. He has come here a few times. One of the days, during the octave of All Saints, he will preach to us. He doesn't want to hear the confessions of anyone. But it seems to me that he would like to hear my confession, and what I suspect -- since in general he is adverse to hearing confessions -- is that his desire comes from his curiosity. They say that he is very much opposed to revelations, that he even says he doesn't believe those given to St. Bridget. He didn't say this to me but has said it to María de Cristo. If this occasion had arisen previously, I would have tried at once to discuss my soul with him, for I used to be drawn toward those who I knew had such opinions, thinking that they would be the ones who would free me from illusion if I were being deceived -- more so than others. Since I no longer have those fears, I don't feel this desire so much, but only a little. If I didn't have a confessor and it seemed all right to you, I would go to him. But I no longer seek guidance much from anyone, except my former confessors, since I am at peace.
6. I am enclosing a letter from Villanueva, for I felt distressed and sorry for that prioress who has to suffer so many trials on account of",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,8,0,5,11,2,0,1,17,7,19,13,4,1,11,3,0,2,0,0
"1106",1581,55,"the subprioress. The situation is almost the same as at Malagón. The disturbance that these nuns with such humors bring to the peace of all the others is a terrible one, and thus I have such fear of allowing them to make profession. I so wish you would go to that house. And if the foundation is made in Granada, it wouldn't be a bad idea to bring her there with one or two lay sisters, for under the guidance of Anne of Jesus and in a larger house, they would get along better, and there would be friars in that place to hear their confessions. Despite everything, I think the house in Villanueva will continue making progress, for there are good souls in the community. And even if they accept two postulants who are relatives of the parish priest, as he desires, things will work out very well if they are given what they should be given.
7. Nicolao desires very much that you go to Seville, and the reason is for what his brother tells him, and it must be of some importance. I have already written him of how well the nuns there are doing, for I received a letter from the prioress. I already wrote him that it wasn't possible for you to leave Salamanca.
8. Here I ruled that when someone is sick the nuns should not visit her together, but one at a time, unless the sickness is of a kind that requires some other procedure. There are many drawbacks to having a number of nuns congregating together, for we are few in number, and this can sometimes lead to gossiping. If you think it would be good, make this a rule there too; and if not, let me know.
9. Oh, mi padre, how difficult Julián is being! He is incapable of refusing to allow Mariana to see him every time she wants, but he even asks her to come and see him. With him everything is holy; but God deliver us from confessors who are up in years. It would be a good thing if this practice were uprooted. What would happen if we were not dealing with such good souls? After having written this letter, I went through certain things here with one of the sisters that displeased me very much, which is why I mentioned this, for I had not thought of speaking about it. The remedy will be to take the two away from here if the foundation is made",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,3,0,12,0,8,12,2,0,0,9,15,22,15,6,2,2,0,0,4,0,0

Today is the vigil of St. Vincent; tomorrow the vigil of the two apostles.
Your reverence's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
10. According to what the prioress of Toledo writes me, the one who is bringing this letter will ask me tomorrow to petition you to give him the habit. This I am doing now. Give orders wherever you are that the prayers for the deceased be said for María Magdalena, whom the good Lord took, as you will see from the enclosed letter -- and inform all the monasteries. For Mother Prioress at St. Joseph's, discalced Carmelite nuns, Seville.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. Your letter consoled me greatly, which is nothing new, for inasmuch as other letters weary me yours bring me relief. I tell you that if you indeed love me, I am grateful that you tell me and enjoy your doing so. How true it is that our human nature wants to be repaid. This could not be wrong, since our Lord also wants this, although there is no comparison between what we give His Majesty and all the love he deserves; but let us become like him however we can.
2. I wrote you a really long letter from Soria. I don't know whether Padre Nicolao sent it to you. I ever have the fear that you didn't receive it. Many prayers were offered here for all of you. I am not surprised that you are well and at rest, but that you are not already saints. For since you had so many needs, the nuns have always offered many prayers for you here. Repay us for them now that you are without trials, since we have many trials, especially in this house of St. Joseph's in Avila, where they have made me prioress now out of sheer hunger. Think of it, at my age and with all I have to do, how this can be borne!
3. You should know that a gentleman here left these nuns I don't know how much that doesn't pay for a quarter of what they need and which they won't be able to use for another year. And now almost all the alms that were being given them have ceased coming in, and they are so weighed down with debt that I don't know how it will",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,16,1,2,10,1,0,0,7,10,7,4,9,2,1,0,0,1,2,2
"1108",1581,57,"all end. Pray for this and for me, for one's human nature grows tired, especially of this being prioress with so much chaos all together. If God is served by this, nothing done is enough.
4. It weighs on me that you resemble me in anything, for everything with me is going from bad to worse, especially in bodily ills. When they spoke to me about the condition of your heart, I didn't become very distressed, for even if the pain is hard to bear when intense it will soak up other pains, and in the end the condition is not dangerous. Since they told me they were afraid of dropsy, I considered the heart problem a good thing. You should know that they don't like to apply many remedies together, but calming the bodily humors is indispensable.
5. Enclosed is a prescription for pills that are approved by many doctors, and a doctor who is highly regarded prescribed them for me. I think they will be very beneficial for you, even though you take one only every fifteen days. They have helped me very much, and so I am far better; although never completely well, because I still experience the vomitings and my other ailments. But the pills have done me great good and don't cause any other disturbance. Don't fail to try them.
6. I had already known about the improvement of my Gabriela, and I had also known about her serious illness, for our padre was here when he received your note. I was very sorry about it and so was Teresa, for she loves you all very much. She sends her regards to you and to all the sisters. If you saw her you would give praise to God for her understanding of the way of perfection and virtue. In your charity ask God to guide her onward, for the way the world is going one cannot trust in anything. We pray very hard for her. May God be praised for everything, for he left her here. Pray much for her, for me, and for all the nuns. Tell Sister San Francisco that I was delighted with her letter and inform her that Acacio García died, and that she should pray for him.
7. I was extremely delighted to know that my good Padre García has returned. God reward you for such good news, for even though they had told me, I couldn't bring myself to believe it however much I desired it to be true. Be very",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,1,12,1,12,23,3,1,1,10,3,9,7,13,1,1,2,4,11,1,1
"1109",1581,58,"gracious to him for me; be aware that he becomes a founder of this order when you consider all the help he gave me. So with him you shouldn't be using the veil that hides your faces. For all the others you should, in particular and in general, and, with the discalced friars first of all, for this is what is done in all the houses.
8. They haven't brought anything from the Indies, for when they wanted to send it, they learned that my brother had died -- may he be in glory -- and it is necessary for them to have a letter from Don Francisco in order that the money be sent. Lorencio is married and very well situated. They say that he has more than six thousand ducats in income. It is no surprise that he didn't write to you since he only just heard about his father's death. Oh, if he knew about the trials of his brother and what I have to go through with all these relatives! And so I run away from having any dealings with them. Since I told this to Padre Nicolao, he wanted me to agree, while I was in Palencia, to send the amount and that later the sum would be given to me here. I told him that in no way would I do that. So, I wrote you not to send me the money through Madrid; I had feared what did happen, and it didn't seem right to me, for I am a friend of openness.
9. Now he has written me again saying that he will send one hundred ducats and that I should collect the other hundred from someone who will not be able to pay it very soon. I wrote to him showing that I was very annoyed with you and saying that you both should have come to an agreement -- that had actually passed through my mind. Despite my advice, you did what you did. What you deserve is to have to pay the amount twice, which is what you will have to do if the money isn't sent to me. But Horacio is wrong, for if you gave him the money to send to me, it is not sufficient for his brother to allow him to keep it as a reimbursement without your authorization.
10. Padre Nicolao says that from an alms of 1500 ducats Horacio is obliged to give your house 1,000. From that amount you can take something for",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,8,1,2,3,8,1,1,0,6,5,11,9,6,0,5,0,1,0,0,0
"1110",1581,59,"what you still must pay. I have written to him to share a little of it with this house, for it is certainly in extreme need. If the occasion arises beseech him a little on our behalf -- for his brother is also doing so -- and arrange with him to withdraw 200 ducats. I am tired of speaking about it to Padre Nicolao, and I'll say no more about it to him. The chapel is going to be started; and if while I am here nothing is done, at least it will have been started. I don't know how or when this will be, for I hope, please God, to go from here to Madrid for a foundation there.
11. You should know that the will speaks of 430 ducats, it seems to me. I also vaguely remember your saying this, that he had given you thirty ducats. Since he had already made out the will when he went down there, and there is no further declaration, I don't know whether or not the thirty ducats has to be subtracted. Would you find out about this. So as not to tire myself, I am not going to read the will again to see if these thirty ducats are supposed to be in addition to the other amount. You will know down there. Believe me that if they were mine or in my power, I would much prefer not to have to bother with the matter. If you saw the state of ruin into which his property is falling! It's a pity, for this lad was above all made for God. And although I want to withdraw from it all, they tell me that I am obliged in conscience. So, losing so good a brother was nothing in comparison to the trials those who remained have caused me. I don't know how it will end up.
12. As for Padre Nicolao, he thought that the money should be given at once so as to pay his brother right away, but what has displeased me is his stubbornness in my regard and that you both in the end acted against my wishes. Certainly, even were I to desire it, I don't know which house could afford to give me that money, even though some might owe it to me. If the expenses of the province are shared and some houses are paying their quota, other houses are not able to pay; and some others have already given much. It would be",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,4,8,3,0,5,7,0,2,3,12,7,19,17,5,2,4,0,0,2,0,0
"1111",1581,60,"better for his brother to wait than for us to fail to build the chapel, a task my brother left to me. And if I die, that would be the end of the matter, considering the need in which his son finds himself. It could be that the money would be spent for something else; in fact, from what I see, that would be certain.
13. Don't fail to write to me about how your spiritual life is going, for that will bring me joy; in view of what you have gone through, it couldn't be going any other way than well. And send me the poems too. I delight in having something to make my sisters happy, for they need this. Let me know if Mother Subprioress has recovered completely. Since God has left her with us, may he be forever blessed.
14. Compline and recreation are observed as usual. I have asked learned men and have mentioned the drawbacks and also that the rule says that silence should be kept until the prayer beginning with the word pretiosa of Prime and no longer, and that here we keep it all day long. This did not seem bad to our padre.
15. The entrance from the sacristy into the church should be bricked up. One should never go out that way -- not even to close the street-door -- for according to the motu proprio one thereby incurs excommunication. Where it is possible, the woman helping us remains inside and closes the door from there. Here where we do not have a woman helping us, we made a lock by which the door can be opened from both the outside and the inside. And a helper from the outside closes it and opens it in the morning. We keep the other key so that if something happens we can get out. The trouble is that the church cannot be kept very clean, but this can't be helped.
16. There should be a turn for the chapel and a good sacristan. Because of the excommunication imposed by the pope concerning both this and the entrance, nothing else can be done. And it was sufficient that it was prescribed by the constitutions, for the danger of not having such a rule about this has already been discovered. To habitually transgress one of these prescriptions is a mortal sin.
17. I wrote this letter over fifteen days ago, I believe. Now I received another from you and from my Father Rodrigo Alvarez, toward whom I",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,2,10,2,6,11,0,1,2,7,5,14,10,6,2,2,0,0,3,0,0
"1112",1581,61,"am greatly obligated because of the good he has brought about in that house. I would like to answer his letter, but I don't know how because some of the things about which he asks me cannot be put in a letter. But if I were to see him -- who is one who knows my soul -- I wouldn't hold back about anything; on the contrary, I would be very happy because I don't have anyone here with whom I can discuss this matter, which would be a consolation for me. If God brings Padre Fray García here, I will have great consolation. Oh, how annoyed it made me that you didn't mention anything about him in your letter. He must have come to Madrid, for that is what I was told, and for that reason I am not writing to him although I have a great desire to do so and to see him. You would be amazed if you knew all that I owe him.
18. To return to what I was saying, since our padre told me that he had left a book there in my handwriting (which you certainly wouldn't be disposed to go through), would you read it to Padre Alvarez when he goes there -- the part about the last dwelling place. Do so under the seal of confession, which is what he in his great prudence asks for. Only the two of you should hear it. Tell him that the person referred to reached that point and experiences that peace that is described there and continues living a life of great calm and that very learned men say that this is all right. If the reading cannot be done there, by no means should you give it to him, because of what could happen. I will not answer until he sends me his opinion about what is written in that book. Give him my regards.
19. With regard to the move to San Bernardo, I am amazed that someone who loves you so much could so deceive himself, for all the sisters in this house were thrilled, and I to such a point that I couldn't wait for the time to move. I must not have reflected well or known anything about the Moors. The move would have given me a feeling of new life, so much do I care for all of you.
20. You should know, my daughter, that it wouldn't bother me for you to move, if you found another",3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,2,1,3,0,3,16,1,2,0,15,9,23,13,7,2,3,1,0,3,1,0
"1113",1581,62,"house that wouldn't leave you with too much debt. But I see so much lacking in the houses here that I consider this impossible, and perhaps one that seems a better one to you will end up having more defects. To tell the truth, the one you are in pleased me very much. There's no reason to speak about it any more, nor will Padre Nicolao speak of it, for I have written to him about the matter. Realize that he thought he had come upon something very worthwhile, and since I saw how much you wanted to move from where you are and how well you spoke of the place, I was praising God. May God give us the light to do the right thing in every endeavor. Padre Nicolao's health is not good. Pray that God will watch over him, for he would be a great loss, and especially to your house.
May God be with your reverence, my daughter, and with all the nuns, and may he make them holy.
Today is 8 November.
21. They have already given me news about the house, which surprised me. You should know that by sharing the resin so much, I now have very little left, and it is what benefits me the most, and others too. When you find someone who will deliver it for you, send me some more, in your charity, and have all the nuns pray that God will provide me with the means to feed these nuns, for I don't know what to do. They all send you their regards.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. As a way of resting from other tiresome business, it would be good for you to write to me at times; for certainly when I see a letter from you, it is for me great grace and comfort, even though it renews in me the feeling of solitude at seeing you so far away and me so alone in this place. May God be praised for everything. I give him many thanks that your health is good and that those gentlemen, your brothers, arrived in good health.
2. Since you are now in Burgos, it wouldn't seem right to me -- provided you agree -- if you failed in any way to make every effort toward a foundation there, since God is now inspiring Señora Doña Catalina to sponsor this. Perhaps there is some mystery involved. She has written me. And",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,4,3,19,0,4,25,0,0,3,12,9,9,17,8,5,3,1,0,4,0,1
"1114",1581,63,"now I am answering her and writing also to the person to whom she asked me to write. I am beseeching you here to write the letter that Mother Prioress asked you to write and other letters that you judge appropriate, for perhaps fear is holding us back. Doña Catalina says that after we began discussing this foundation, the city gave permission for the foundation of other monasteries. I don't know why they have to make such a fuss over thirteen women for the number is very small -- unless because this is most troublesome to the devil. What you say seems to me a drawback, but there will be other ones to follow. If this is the devil's work, it will prove useless if God wants the foundation.
3. May His Majesty direct everything to his service and preserve you in the holiness that I beg of him for you every day, miserable though I am.
4. Since I have so many letters to write, I cannot be as long as I would like. My health is better than usual, and I don't feel that the cold is doing me any harm, although there is a lot of snow.
From this house of St. Joseph's in Avila, 13 November.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
5. I beg you to do me the favor of giving my best regards to Señor Suero de Vega and to Señora Doña Elvira and assure them that I always take care to pray for them and those angels of theirs. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. You can well believe that I am not at ease and will not be as long as I know you are in Alba. And so I want to know what is being done about this and that you are not neglecting to take action, because the occasion for trouble has by no means gone away. For the love of our Lord, do not be negligent. Winter has begun so early that it won't be a bad idea to go where you will have a more pleasant climate, as is your custom. The devil -- believe me -- is not sleeping, as I have been informed. This is true, and so I am very much afraid that it will be impossible to set matters straight if we wait. And for us to be silent about her will not be taken in a good light.
2. And certainly, setting aside all these very important considerations -- that",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,12,0,13,18,3,0,3,12,8,7,10,8,0,3,2,1,2,1,0
"1115",1581,64,"cannot be exaggerated -- the means that is being suggested is a fitting solution to your daughter's situation; she can't be living with her parents forever. If by chance Gonzalo Yáñez does not offer his house, you cannot avoid going to Galinduste and then coming here from there as was the agreement. In one way or another, for the love of God, stop killing me. Best regards to my sister. My health is reasonably good.
3. You should know that letters have arrived from the Indies, but no money; at the moment in which they were going to send some, they learned of my brother's death (may he be in glory) and need certain documents in order to send it.
4. Agustín de Ahumada says that he will return here in a year, not rich but with hope of favor from the king. They say the king will honor him because he has served much, and that he will be favored by the viceroy who has returned.
5. Don Lorencio married the daughter of a judge who managed to get the natives to pay Lorencio what the king had awarded him. They have done so in such a way that it is said that he receives around seven thousand ducats in income. His wife is a woman of graceful manners, and they say that he is a very discreet and good man. In the letter from his brother, he sends his best regards to you both and to Señora Doña Beatriz as well.
6. He says that he is not sending you anything now because he has had many expenses, that he will send it with another fleet when Agustín returns. Please God it will be something, for however small, it will be a help. I will insist on this very much when I write to him. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to write and congratulate him and send me the letter.
7. My best regards to Señor Don Gonzalo, and tell him to remember what he promised me; and my greetings to Señora Doña Beatriz. I don't know when she will repay me for all my prayers to God for her.
May His Majesty be with your honors and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen.
Today is 14 November.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus To my lord, Doctor Castro.
1. Jesus be with your honor. The favor that your honor showed me by your letter so moved me that I first gave thanks to our Lord with a Te",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1,5,10,2,3,25,1,1,0,8,5,5,10,3,0,5,0,0,3,1,0
"1116",1581,65,"Deum laudamus, for it seemed I was receiving it from the very hands of the one from whom I have received so many other favors. Now I kiss your hands an infinite number of times, and I would like to do so through deeds rather than with words. How great the mercy of God, that through my wickedness you should benefit; and with reason, for I am not in hell, which for a long time I have deserved. So, this book is entitled On the Mercies of God.
2. May he be always praised, for I had never hoped for less than what he has now accorded me. Nonetheless, every severe word was disturbing to me. I would rather not say more on paper, and so I beg you to come to see me tomorrow, the eve of the Presentation, that I might present to you a soul often undone, so that you might bring about all that you understand as fitting for her in order that she please God. I hope in His Majesty for the grace to obey you all my life, for I don't think your absence will let me feel free, nor do I want to, for I have seen changes come about by reason of this desire. It would be impossible for a great good not to come to me through this obedience -- provided you do not abandon me, and I don't think you will. As a pledge of this obedience, I am thinking of keeping this note, although I have another more important one.
3. What I beg of you is that for love of our Lord you always keep what I am in mind so as not to pay attention to the favors granted me by God unless for the sake of considering me even worse than you thought, since I make such poor use of them; clearly the more I receive from him the more indebted to him I am. Repay this Lord of mine, since His Majesty desires to punish me only with favors -- which is no small punishment for anyone with self-knowledge.
4. When you finish these papers, I will give you others. On seeing them it will be impossible for you to keep from abhorring someone who should be other than what I am. I think you will like them. May our Lord give you his joy as I beg of him for you.
5. You have not lost any of my esteem by the style of your letters.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,3,11,0,10,19,1,4,2,12,11,14,11,7,3,1,3,2,2,2,0
"1117",1581,66,"I ought to be praising you for its elegance. Everything is useful to God when the desire to serve him is at the root. May he be blessed for everything, amen. Not for a long time have I had as much happiness as I have had this night. I kiss your hands many times for the title you give me, which is a very lofty one for me. 1. Jesus be with your honor. My capacity for insight is too small for me to have ever imagined yesterday evening that you would say ""no"" as you did today. You were much more able to sense and dispel the distress of that poor little soul, for she certainly had to go through a painful day, and that wasn't the only one, for she has gone through many. I don't have anything more to say to her mother, but only have to do what you command, for that is what it means to be a subject. And even if it were not what it means, it is so repugnant to my nature to ask someone to do something burdensome that I would act the same way.
2. Now they tell me that Ana de San Pedro has asked Don Alonso to be sure to go and beseech this of you. That was before your note arrived, for I would never in any way have agreed to this after the note. The sermon can be omitted if Father Provincial doesn't come. Clearly, a sermon should not be requested of someone who would not be pleased to comply, but to her parents it will seem a greater loss than spoiling the partridges, and I don't know what they will do. May our Lord make you as holy as I beg of him.
3. I hope this letter reaches you before Don Alonso arrives, for not in the slightest way would I want you to think I am doing anything against your will; what is more, I get very annoyed with this meddling.
Your honor's daughter and servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your honor and may His Majesty repay you for the joy and help you have given me today. I also have a desire and if you do not do what you can to fulfill it, I will think it would have been better for me not to have known you, so much will my suffering be. And my trial is this: it doesn't make me happy for you to go to heaven,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,11,0,6,18,1,1,2,10,4,15,14,7,0,2,1,1,1,1,0
"1118",1581,67,"for you have much to do in God's church. I begged God urgently today not to allow so good a mind to be occupied in anything else.
2. These sisters kiss your hands. You have brought them much consolation. Let me know if you got tired and how you are; but not by mail, for as happy as I would be to receive a letter from you, I wouldn't want to tire you any more than I think necessary, and that is already a lot. I am very happy this evening because of a visit with a father of our order, even though I neglected to send a message to the marchioness, for he is passing through Escalona.
The letter for Alba is going in a very safe way. And I am your honor's daughter and servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus watch over your reverence for me. I wrote you a long letter today, and so I will not enlarge on this one because of my many other occupations; we had a profession today and I am really tired.
2. For the foundation in Granada I have given the order that they take two nuns from there, and I am trusting that you won't give the worst. So I ask this of you please, for you well know how important it is that they be very virtuous and competent. In this way you will have more room so that you can accept some new nuns and repay me sooner, for it pains me to have to leave for Burgos without any work having been begun on my brother's chapel. And they tell me I am obliged in conscience to have this built. I tell you this so that you will realize that I cannot wait much longer to get the work started.
3. So, do what you can to send me the money, and pray for me, because after Christmas I am going to make that foundation in Burgos -- and that region is very cold at this time. If it were close to where you are and I knew I would get to see you, the trip wouldn't bother me at all. But our Lord will arrange that we meet again some day.
4. My health is reasonably good, thanks be to God, for through your prayers and those of all the nuns, the Lord is helping me bear the trials. Teresa sends regards to you and all the sisters.

From this house in Avila, November twenty-eighth.
Many regards to all the sisters.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your excellency. So great was the favor you did me in sending the book that I wouldn't know how to exaggerate it. I kiss your hands many times, and will keep my word as you request. But not knowing whether the book will be safe during your long journey away from home, I would like to keep it, if you wouldn't mind, until you return to Alba. If you want it returned, let the prioress know that you don't want to grant what I have requested (I should say begged for), and she can inform me. If she doesn't say anything, I will take this to mean that you are granting me this favor.
2. May it please our Lord to keep you in the good health that I and all of your subjects beg of him. I have much to offer His Majesty, for he knows what I feel in seeing you go away without my having the chance to kiss your hands. May he be forever blessed who wishes me to have so little happiness on earth. His will be done in everything, for I well see that I don't deserve more.
3. In a way, if I had been there I would have been able to bear better what I suffered in hearing of your trials, for I would have been able to kiss your hands ...
4. God give you the health that I beg of him for you each day, and may he keep you for me many years -- at least for more than he does me. News about your cold kept me from enjoying completely the favor you granted me by your letter. I beg you never to do so again on my account, for it would have been enough for me to have your secretary write a few words. So I beg you to let me know from time to time how you and Don Fadrique are faring.
5. May the Lord be pleased to grant good health to his lordship and her ladyship the duchess, for although they may have forgotten me, I don't fail to do what I am obliged to do in my poor prayers, and also for the one I know you love dearly.
6. Father Provincial has been sending me hopeful news about the success of the negotiations there, which has been",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,2,2,11,0,2,24,0,0,2,9,2,15,12,6,2,3,5,3,3,4,0
"1120",1581,69,"most consoling for me; and also about the favor you showed him in requesting him to accompany you. I don't think it's wrong that I am envious of him. He desires very much to comply with your wishes from what he writes to me. I would like to beg you for now that out of love of our Lord you not so order him, for he is at present busy having the constitutions printed, and this is something for which we have the greatest need, and the monasteries are waiting for them.
May the Lord be with your excellency.
Your excellency's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus To the most illustrious Señora Doña María de Mendoza. My lady.
1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your ladyship, amen. I have often thought of you during this weather we're having and have feared lest its harshness do damage to your health. And I believe it did. May God be blessed, for we will one day see eternity without changes in the weather. May it please His Majesty that we live this life in a way that will enable us to enjoy so great a blessing. My region has proved such a trial for me that it doesn't seem I was born here. From the beginning of my stay, I don't believe I've had as much as a month and a half of good health. The Lord saw that without my health I wouldn't be able to get anything straightened out, so His Majesty does it all. I do nothing but pamper myself -- especially three weeks ago when on top of the quartan fevers I suffered from a pain in my side and from quinsy. Just one of these afflictions would have been enough to kill me if God had so willed, but it doesn't seem there is anything capable of rendering me this blessing. After having been bled three times, I am feeling better. The quartan fevers have gone away, but there's a fever I have that never goes away, and so I am going to be purged tomorrow. I'm vexed at seeing myself in so miserable a condition, for I do not leave my little corner, nor can I, unless for Mass. What causes me the most suffering is a painful jaw, which I have had for about a month and a half.
2. I am giving you an account of all these illnesses so that you will not fault me for having failed to write",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,0,1,14,1,12,15,2,2,5,8,3,7,14,5,3,0,1,1,10,1,0
"1121",1581,70,"you, and you will see that these are the favors the Lord gives me in answer to what I am always asking him for. Indeed, from the time I arrived it seemed to me impossible to endure so much tribulation with such poor health and so weak a constitution; for even without the responsibility of this house there are always many business matters that arise with respect to our monasteries and many other things to exhaust me. Thus you see that all things can be done in God who gives us the power, as St. Paul says. He gives me many illnesses all together, and nonetheless I so carry out all my duties that I sometimes have to laugh to myself; and he leaves me without a confessor and so alone that there is no one with whom I might talk things over for the sake of some relief, and I have to be on my guard about everything. But in matters concerning my bodily comfort there has been no lack of compassion or someone to care for me. The people here have given me much in alms; thus it is only the bread I eat that comes from the house, and even this I'd rather not take. We are about to deplete the alms given us by Doña Magdalena, for until now they provided a meal (with the help of alms from you and others) for the poorest nuns.
3. Since I now see the nuns to be so tranquil and good, it would grieve me to have to see them suffer, for they are indeed just like what I said. Our Lord is to be praised for the change he has wrought in them. The ones who were most forbidding are now the ones who are more satisfied and accepting of me. During this Lent there are no women visitors, nor men, even though they be parents, which is something very new for this house. Nonetheless, they accept it all with much peace. Truly, there are great servants of God living here, and almost all the nuns are improving. My ""prioress"" is working these marvels. That you might understand that this is so, our Lord has ordained that I be in such a condition that it doesn't seem I've come here for any other reason than to abhor penance and think only about my own comfort.
4. Now, that I might suffer in every way, Mother Prioress of your monastery writes me that you want her to admit",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,3,13,1,7,19,0,0,4,10,5,5,13,12,4,2,0,1,5,0,3
"1122",1581,71,"an aspirant and that you are displeased because they told you I did not want to accept her. She wants me to send her the authorization to accept this one and another that Padre Ripalda is presenting. I think there has been a mistake. I would be distrssed if it were true that you were displeased with me, for you may give me orders and scold me. I cannot believe that you would be displeased with me and not tell me, unless you pretended to be so in order to avoid some trouble. I would be very much consoled if this were true, for I know how to get along with those Fathers of the Society. They wouldn't accept anyone unsuited for their order just to do me a favor. If you should want to give decisive orders, there would be no need for further discussion, for clearly you can give orders for this house, and the others too, and you must be obeyed by me. I would then request permission from Father Visitator or from Father General because it is against our constitutions to accept anyone with such a defect, and I would not be able to grant a permission contrary to the constitutions without the consent of one of them. These two aspirants would have to learn how to read Latin well, for we are ordered not to accept anyone who does not know it.
5. To satisfy my conscience I cannot neglect to mention to you what, after recommending the matter to the Lord, I would do in this case. I am setting aside, as I say, your desires, for I must be ready to submit to them in everything so as not to oppose them, and I'll say no more about this. I only beg you to consider the matter carefully and desire what is best for your house, for when you see that she does not fit in there, you will regret it. In a house where there are many nuns, one can overlook whatever defect there may be; but where there are so few, it makes sense to be selective. I've always noticed that you have this same outlook. Furthermore, I have found everywhere so many aspiring to be nuns, and I have not dared to send any of them to your monastery, for I wanted one who would be as excellent a nun as I would want there, and I did not find her. So, in my opinion, neither of these two",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,0,5,0,7,14,1,0,2,16,6,27,12,7,1,2,0,0,1,0,0
"1123",1581,72,"should be accepted, for I do not see in them either holiness or fortitude or much discretion or many talents -- gifts that would be beneficial to the house. Well, if the house would be the loser, why do you want to accept them? To help them, there are many monasteries where, since the numbers are large, as I say, the defects could be more easily tolerated. There in your monastery, anyone who is accepted should be capable of being prioress or holding any other office that is given to her.
6. For love of our Lord may you consider the matter well and see that it is always better to look after the common good than some particular good, and since the nuns have to be enclosed and live their lives together, and bear with one another's faults, along with the other austerities in the order, the worst trial for them would be someone imposed on them whose vocation is not certain. You should favor them in this matter just as you favor us in all other matters. If you give the orders, you can entrust this matter to me, for, as I say, I know how to deal with the Fathers of the Society. If you should still persist in your wishes, what you enjoin will be respected, as I have said, and if the matter does not turn out well, the responsibility will lie with you. I don't think the one mentioned by Father Ripalda would do badly were we dealing with some other order, but the nuns are just starting out there and so must be careful not to bring discredit on the house. May our Lord ordain what is for his greater glory and enlighten you so that you do what is most fitting; and may he preserve you many years for us, as I beseech him, for I do not neglect praying for you, however ill I might be.
7. I kiss the hands of her excellency, my lady the duchess, many times, and of my lady Beatriz,[ and of my ladies, the countess and Doña Leonor. Write to me -- I mean may you give me orders -- and what pleases you will be done, for I believe that by leaving everything to your conscience my own conscience will feel assured, but not without effort. In none of our houses will any nun be found with so noticeable a defect, nor would I accept her for anything. I think it would be a",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,8,0,7,23,0,0,2,14,4,18,21,6,3,3,2,1,2,2,0
"1124",1581,73,"continuous mortification for the other nuns, for since they are always together and love one another so much, this would cause them incessant grief. They already have the good Magdalene there; and that is enough, please God.
Today is 7 March.
Your ladyship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
Mother Subprioress kisses your ladyship's hands many times. I get along well with her. To the illustrious Lord Juan de Ovalle, my lord, for your hands or those of my sister. Alba.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor, amen. Recently I wrote you, and I have a great desire to know what is being done about everything. Today I received a letter in which they tell me the city of Burgos has granted the license for me to make a foundation there, for I already have permission from the bishop. I think I will go there to make a foundation before Madrid. I regret going there without seeing my sister first because it could be that I will be going from there to Madrid.
2. I was thinking that if Doña Beatriz has the desire to be a nun, it would be a good idea if I brought her with me, first giving her the habit here. She will enjoy getting to know the monasteries, and afterward I can bring her to Madrid. She will be a foundress before making profession and hardly realizing it will be outside herself with joy and be able to return to Alba. Our Lord knows how much I desire for her to be at peace and for you and my sister to be greatly consoled at seeing her with the habit. Think this over well and pray about it, for I am doing so urgently. May it please His Majesty to guide the matter to what brings him most glory, amen. And may he watch over you.
3. Let my sister consider this to be for her, too. Best regards to my niece and nephew and also to Teresa and the two of you. The messenger is a private one, for he is going to Salamanca to our Father Provincial to get the license for a certain resignation. I am having him pass through there on his way and on his return. Answer me and give the letter to Mother Prioress, but don't say anything to anyone for now about this Burgos matter.
Today is 29 November.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
4. Turn the page. If you do that it won't be necessary for you",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,16,1,3,18,0,0,3,10,9,10,11,4,3,1,2,2,0,2,0
"1125",1581,74,"to leave there. The fact that I am going so far away is sufficient reason for my sister to come to see me; afterward I can say that I want to bring my niece with me and no one here will have anything to object to.
5. If this seems alright with you, I will let you know once we set the time for my departure. Even if they come beforehand, nothing will be lost. I never received any news about Señora Doña Mayor's health, which I would like; nor have I found anyone with whom to send these toques. Since they weigh so much, no one wants to take them. Give her my regards and let me know how she is. I am doing fairly well. It doesn't seem to me that I ever heard Joseph say that I should go immediately to Burgos. He didn't say anything about leaving sooner or later, but only that I should not entrust the task to someone else, as I was thinking of doing. 1. Jesus. Padre Fray Ambrosio is bringing the eight escudos that Antonio Ruiz gave me to send to you. I obtained two with the help of good reasons; I couldn't get any more. It seems I am learning how to be a beggar -- something really new for me -- and I don't feel the least bit embarrassed. It's true that since the money belongs to the order, I don't get troubled. May our Lord make you very holy, as I beg of him, amen.
2. Give my best regards to Mother Prioress. If those fathers are so cold in the house they are buying, what must the nuns be undergoing? Their faith will save them, for I certainly have little faith as regards that house.
It is the first of December.
3. Let me know how your feet are. You must be having really cold weather if you are now getting chill blains, for nothing else causes them. I am doing fairly well, although tired.
4. All the nuns recommend themselves to your prayers, especially Teresa, who is very happy with her diurnal; and the other nuns are happy with their books.
Your reverence's servant, subject, and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
For our Father Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios, provincial of the discalced Carmelites, mi padre, Salamanca. 1. ... left without one or the other, as you say. Renting it will not do, because they are forced to buy a house as soon as possible, be it good or bad.",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,4,5,11,0,4,15,1,0,1,12,11,12,21,8,1,5,3,1,2,0,1
"1126",1581,75,"And I don't know why it is that I cannot feel disappointed that they couldn't come to an agreement over the Monroy house, for it seems to me they would die if they stayed there. Not all the monasteries are in places where the nuns would have wanted to be, but only where they could be. Anyway, you will see what is best. I don't know how you can say that you will come with my sister, or how you could find time for that.
2. This enclosed letter written to me by Francisco's mother-in-law came two days ago, and it annoyed me very much to see such bad motives. The learned men from around here say that the will can not be annulled without one's sinning mortally. I believe I will find it necessary not to allow this child to be separated from me; and so they will be unable to do anything about this, nor would we permit it. That she be left to go free is what I fear. She is now sick with a bad cold and a fever. I very much recommend her as well as all the nuns to your prayers.
3. Remain with God, for it just struck twelve o'clock. Either inform them about what has to be done so that they can make the trip, or let me know.
Anne of St. Bartholomew does not stop writing; she helps me very much. She kisses your reverence's hands.
You should know that I don't have anyone to go with me to Burgos, so don't think of abandoning me.
Today is 4 December. 1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor always. It seems to me that in begging you not to write to me, I was referring to the business about the will. To refuse the favor of receiving letters from you would be foolish of me, for I well understand what a great favor you do me by writing. But it pains me deeply when the purpose concerns things that in conscience I cannot do. And some others that, as I understand it from what they tell me, would not be right for Don Francisco to do either. But since you are being told otherwise, you cannot help being suspicious of my good will, which is very painful to me; and so I have a strong desire to see all these things brought to a conclusion. May the Lord work everything out in conformity with what most accords with his",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,3,10,2,10,14,2,1,2,19,9,12,11,6,3,2,3,1,4,1,0
"1127",1581,76,"service, for this is the very thing you would like. I never had any other desire, not even its first stirring. I have always wanted what would bring you peace and have seen the many things that Señora Doña Orofrisia deserves.
2. As for what you say about my having written you that our Lord would give you sons, I repeat it and hope in His Majesty that you will have them. I have never paid much attention to the aims of Pedro de Ahumada, and this is also true now. I am so tired of becoming involved in what turns out to be nothing that if I were not obliged in conscience, I would abandon everything, and I had decided in fact to do so. But Perálvarez told me that a decision like that would displease you because it would affect St. Joseph's.
3. Since for my sins they have now made me prioress there, I see that you are right; and also that it is necessary, as far as the house goes, to value its rights so that a conclusion can be reached sooner than what I was told by some learned men. Even though my brother's children (may he be in glory) did not think the will was valid, it remains valid because it cannot be known who opened it; many lawsuits would result. You are right in demanding that everything be clarified, for it is a terrible thing and a huge expense to go about consulting lawyers.
4. May our Lord take care of this matter, as he can, and preserve you many years to the benefit of your children, amen.
Your honor's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
5. Sister Teresa of Jesus kisses your hands. I hope in God that before long we will both kiss them. She and I send our best regards to Señor Don Francisco. 1. Jesus be with your reverence, my father. I greatly rejoiced both to receive your letter, which they gave me tonight along with the rest of the scapulars, and to observe how determined you are that I see you soon. Please God you will have a good trip, mi padre. If something still needs to be done on the constitutions, leave instructions. And for goodness' sake, if you have to preach the last day of Christmas, don't leave until the following day so that you won't get sick, for I don't know where you get the energy. Blessed be he who gives it to you. I am amused at",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,3,12,0,3,21,0,0,1,11,7,15,11,8,3,1,1,1,2,2,0
"1128",1581,77,"how rich you have become. May God make you so with eternal riches.
2. Now I don't understand some forms of sanctity. I'm referring to the one who doesn't write to you. And the other one, who says he does everything following his own opinion, has tested my patience. O Jesus, how rarely does one find perfection in this life! Such great foolishness! Because this messenger is going to be leaving, I will not enlarge on the matter, and I am in the process of finishing a letter to the Marchioness of Villena whose personal messenger is waiting.
3. I believe it would be good if you sent me a personal messenger, provided my sister is not in Alba. If you think, have someone go fetch her. But if that young girl has to return the way she came, I have no desire that she come here, nor do I know why she should, except to tire me out. As for her staying at the Incarnation, that's a joke, for I don't think that it would suit her, and the expense is terrible. God be with them who give me such a life.
4. Teresa is well, and I think we can be sure about her, for she has made her intentions clearly known, as you will learn. I am reasonably well.
5. The duchess has written to me again through a chaplain. I answered her briefly and said that I had written her at length through you. I am saying this so that you will send her the letter. If you haven't done so because I mention that you cannot accompany her, it doesn't matter.
6. Have this enclosed letter sent to my sister, if you think it opportune. Perhaps on her return God will help Beatriz to be better disposed, if she has not decided to leave. If she were always to stay in the country, I wouldn't mind. But once summer comes, they will return to Alba -- and it will begin again.
7. The day after tomorrow a departure for Madrid is scheduled. I will be sending your messages. The scapulars are really edifying, they inspire devotion. Don Francisco sent to ask his sister for one. It distresses me. I remind you again that if it is necessary for you to send me any messages when those people come here that you do so. Remain with God, for it is late at night.
8. You should know that we have arranged a little place for you to stay; but I don't",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,3,6,0,3,13,1,0,0,17,9,14,14,6,0,3,0,0,3,0,0
"1129",1581,78,"think Doctor Castro will agree to it. I get along very well with him. I gave him the part of that book that I had here. He never stops talking about the benefit he derived from the other book. As for me, it is enough that he is your friend for me to like everything about him. I think that for a confessor to understand me and not go about with fears, there is nothing better than for him to read one of these writings; it spares me a lot of grief.
May God keep you and give you the rest that I ask him to, amen, amen.
Your reverence's servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
9. I am not writing to your reverence because the thought of your coming makes me so happy that it doesn't allow me to do anything else than thank you very much and kiss your hands for the great care you show for my health and comfort. I am well, in the hope of seeing you soon and the happiness the diurnal brings me. May it please God to repay you in the manner I beg of him.
10. I find Teresa's message a delight. Now I believe there is no greater remedy than love. May God grant it to us with His Majesty. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, my son. I received your letter. In addition to the great joy it brought me with the news of the good fortune our Lord has bestowed on you, it stirred up again the pain I feel over the sorrow you recently had, and so rightly. Because at the time of the death of my brother (may he be in glory) I wrote you at great length, I do not want to stir up your pain again. I have had much grief at seeing how differently things have turned out from the way I would have wanted them to; although as I have written you, I am greatly relieved to see Don Francisco as well settled as you are. Setting aside the fact that his wife is tied on all sides to the most illustrious families in Spain, she has so many good personal qualities that they would be enough. Write to her with all the courtesy you can and do something for her that will please her, for she deserves it. I tell you that even though Don Francisco has a good-sized fortune, he married well. But with the restrictions set",2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5,1,2,11,3,6,30,1,0,3,8,5,5,9,5,3,0,2,1,4,2,0
"1130",1581,79,"down by his father (may he be in glory), the provisions made for Teresa, and the payment of debts, so little remained that if God doesn't provide, I don't know how he will live.
2. May he be praised forever who has so favored you, for he has given you a wife with whom you can live in great peace. This is most fortunate, for it brings me great joy to think that you have a wife like this. I kiss the hands of Doña María many times. In me she has someone who will pray for her, and many other nuns along with me. We would very much like to enjoy her presence here, but if this would require her to undergo the trials that are here, I would rather see her at rest there than suffering here.
3. I find my consolation in Sister Teresa de Jesús. She is now a woman and always growing in virtue. You can truly accept her counsels, for I had to smile when I read the letter she wrote you. God truly speaks in her, and she does well what she says. He is guiding her, for she is edifying to us all. She is very perceptive, and I think she will be able to deal with everything. Don't neglect to write her, for she is indeed alone. Knowing how much her father loved her and the kindnesses he showed her, I feel pity to see that nobody remembers to pay any attention to her. Don Francisco loves her very much, but he can't do anything more.
4. Diego Juárez went on at greater length than you and my brother in telling us about the qualities of Señora Doña María and the other good things that have gone favorably for you, for you write very short letters for someone who is so far away. It is a great favor from God's mercy that you have met with such good fortune and married so soon, for considering how you started out so early in life to go astray you could have been for us a cause of great worry. Herein I see how much I love you, for even though what you did was very distressing to me because of its being an offense against God, when I see how much this little girl resembles you, I can't help but welcome and love her. As little as she is, it's wonderful to see how much she resembles Teresa in the practice of patience.

"1131",1581,80,"God make her his servant, for she is not at fault, and so don't be negligent in taking care to see that she is brought up well. That will not be the case if when she grows older she remains where she is. It will be better if she is brought up by her aunt until you can see what God may be wanting to do with her. You could send a sum of money here from time to time -- since our Lord has given it to you -- to be deposited, and the interest could be used for her support. When she is twelve years old, the Lord will ordain what may be done for her, but it is very important that she be taught the way of virtue, for that is the revenue for what she will become. Certainly she deserves it, for she is pleasing to everyone and, being so little, she wouldn't want to leave here.
6. It wouldn't have been necessary for you to send anything if it were not for the fact that this house is now in great need. Francisco de Salcedo has died -- may he enjoy glory -- and has left a legacy, but it is not sufficient to pay for the food, not even enough for supper. After that, almost all the alms stopped coming in. Although things should get better with the passing of time, up until now nothing has been brought to us, and so there is much suffering. A dowry for Teresa will be a great help, if God allows her to make profession. She has a strong desire to do so.
7. At times my health is better than usual. After your departure God founded a monastery in Palencia, one in Soria, and another in Granada, and after Christmas I am going to make a foundation in Burgos. I am thinking of returning here quickly, if God be so served.
8. Now I am awaiting my sister and her daughter. Her need is so great that you would feel much pity for her. I already feel great pity for Doña Beatriz, for although she wants to be a nun, she doesn't have the means. It would be a great act of charity if, when you can, you would send them something, for however little it might amount to, it will be a lot. I am the one who doesn't need money, but I ask God to let me do his will in everything and make you",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,6,11,1,4,20,0,0,3,5,9,21,14,5,2,0,2,0,1,0,2

9. All the nuns in this house send you their best regards, especially Madre San Jerónimo, and we continue to pray for you. Look, my son, that since you have the name of so good a father you have the works as well.
10. When this arrives, according to what he writes to me, my brother Agustín de Ahumada, will be on his way. May it please God to grant him a good voyage. If he has not departed, would you send him this letter, for I don't have the head today for much writing. I tell you that if he doesn't have enough for his food, he will suffer a great trial, for he won't find anyone to provide his food; and I will suffer a great trial, too, because I won't be able to help him. The viceroy has already arrived, and Padre García is well, although I have not seen him. It is a hard thing to undertake so dangerous a journey at such an advanced age for the sake of a fortune, when we shouldn't be attending to anything else than preparing for heaven. May God grant it to us and may he make you as holy as I beg of him, amen, amen.
11. I kiss repeatedly the hands of all those lords and ladies, and I say no more but refer to the letter by Teresa de Jesús. If you do what she advises, I will be satisfied.
From this house of St. Joseph's in Avila, 15 December, in the year 1581.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence and with all of the nuns, my daughters. Believe me truly that I would like to write to each one of you individually, but there is such a barrage of correspondence and business matters pouring down on me that it is even difficult to be able to write these lines to all of you together. This is especially so because we have approached the eve of our departure. Pray that our Lord will be served by everything, especially by this foundation in Burgos.
2. I am greatly consoled to know through your letters, and even more so through your words and deeds, of the great affection you have for me. I truly believe, though, that you still fall short of repaying me what you owe me for my affection, even though you have been very generous in the",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,3,17,0,4,21,0,1,2,5,5,6,8,9,2,1,2,2,0,1,2
"1133",1581,82,"help you have given me. Since the need was great, I have prized your help very much. Our Lord will reward you. It truly seems you serve him, since you have enough to be able to do such a good deed for these poor nuns. All of them are grateful to you for it and will pray to our Lord for you. Since I do this continually, I have nothing to add.
3. I am delighted that everything is going so well for you, especially since there have been some occasions for your being criticized without your having been at fault; that is a lovely thing, for you have had little to endure on this foundation by which you could merit. Concerning our Padre Vallejo, I say no more than ask our Lord always to repay him for the great services he renders His Majesty, along with increasing trials. And since he is doing such a great work for that house, I am not surprised that the Lord wants to give him the means for gaining more and more merit.
4. Look, my daughters, it is right that, when this saint enters, Mother Prioress and all the nuns help her with kindness and love, for where there is so much virtue it is not necessary to be strict about anything, for it will suffice for her to see what the nuns are doing and to have so good a father; I believe you will be able to see this for yourselves.
5. That Mother Subprioress is better was a great joy for me. If she always needs to eat meat, it doesn't matter that she does so even in Lent, for one does not break the rule when a necessity is present; nor should one be strict in this matter. I ask our Lord to give me virtues, especially humility and love for the others, which is what is important. May it please His Majesty that I see you all growing in these, and ask of him the same for me.
The vigil of the feast of King David. Today is the day on which we arrived for the foundation in Palencia.
6. Best regards to my little ones -- for I am delighted that they are well and so pleasant -- and to the doctors. The improvement in Madre María de Cristo's condition makes me very happy, as well as the fact that you have added such beautiful things in such a short time.
Your servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,12,0,2,34,0,1,0,3,8,6,5,9,5,1,0,0,1,2,1
"1134",1581,83,"the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. I arrived here in Medina del Campo a day before the eve of the Epiphany, and I did not want to go further without telling you of where I am going -- in case you want to give me some orders -- and ask you to kiss the hands of his illustrious lordship for me and tell him I have found that our Sister Elena de Jesús is well and that the others are too. So great is her happiness that it made me give praise to our Lord. She has even grown heavier. All are so extremely pleased with her that it seems her vocation is truly from our Lord. May he be always praised. They kiss the hands of his illustrious lordship many times, and I and the other nuns take special care to ask our Lord to preserve him for many years.
2. It's a great consolation for me to learn the good news about his lordship. May it please His Divine Majesty to always give him an increase of holiness. Sister Elena de Jesús is so much at ease and fulfills her duties as a religious so well that she seems to have been one for many years. May God guide her and his lordship's other relatives, for certainly souls like these are to be esteemed.
3. In no way had I planned on leaving Avila until making the foundation in Madrid. Our Lord has been pleased that some persons in Burgos have had so great a desire that one of these monasteries be founded there that they have obtained permission from both the archbishop and the city. So I am going there with some sisters to bring this about. The project requires obedience from me, and our Lord wants it to cost me more; because when I was as close to Burgos as Palencia, he wasn't pleased that a foundation then be made, but afterward when I was in Avila. For it is no small trial now to make such a long trip.
4. I beg you to ask His Majesty that this foundation will be for his glory and honor, for if this is so, the more suffering there is the better. And don't fail to let me know how the health of his lordship is and how yours is. Certainly the more monasteries he has, the more subjects he will have to pray to the Lord our God for him. May it please His Majesty to",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,24,0,2,28,0,0,2,5,12,5,10,8,0,0,3,2,1,2,0
"1135",1581,84,"watch over him as is our need.
5. We are leaving for Burgos tomorrow. May God give you as much of his love as I and these sisters beg of him.
Do not forget me in your holy sacrifices, for the love of our Lord, and do me the favor when you see Doña Luisa de la Cerda to tell her that I am well, for I don't have time to say more.
Today is 8 January.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus To the most illustrious Señora Doña María de Mendoza, my lady, Valladolid.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be always with your ladyship, amen. Since I wrote to you yesterday, this letter is only to let you know that today they brought me letters from the Duchess of Osuna and from Doctor Ayala urging that one of those young ladies be received; and a Father from the Society who went there to inquire about this has written me a good report on one of them. The other one would be frightened by the austerity. That is why it is good that the one who speaks to aspirants describe the austerity with candor. Nothing more was said about that other one. I have written that the one could be accepted right away. And I mentioned that I had written you about what must be done to give her the habit at once, and that they should inform you as soon as she arrives in Valladolid.
2. I am writing to our Father Visitator, telling him of your desire to receive her and begging his paternity to send you his permission along with this letter. I think he will do so, and if he doesn't, you should immediately write again to him in such a way that no mistake can be made about your request. From what I understand, Father Visitator will not fail to make you happy whenever he can. May our Lord give us the happiness that will last forever and may he always guide you.
3. Today the Bishop sent word that he is better and that he will visit us. Do not be troubled. When will I see you with more freedom? May our Lord bring this about. It is true that we need to help each other. May it please God that when I see you I will find you more in control of yourself, for you have a spirit suited to being so. I think it would be beneficial for you to have me close to you, as",2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,14,0,4,15,1,0,1,8,5,11,8,5,4,3,0,0,1,2,0
"1136",1581,85,"it is for me to have our Father Visitator present. As my superior, he tells me the truth, and I -- daring as I am and habituated to having you put up with me -- would do the same with you. I recommend myself to the prayers of my lady, the duchess. The sisters here are fervent in their prayers for you.
Your ladyship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
4. You never mention how you get along with Padre Fray Juan Gutiérrez; some day I will speak to you about it. Please give him my regards. I don't know whether his niece made her profession. It is Father Visitator who gives permission for those who are to make it. Would you inform Mother Prioress about this fact, for I forgot to do so. 1. I often reflect, my Lord, that if there is something by which life can endure being separated from You, it is solitude. For the soul rests in the quiet of solitude; yet, since it is not completely free for the enjoyment of solitude, the torment is often doubled. But the torment arising from the obligation to deal with creatures and from not being allowed to be alone with one's Creator makes the soul consider that first torment a delight. But why is this, my God, that quiet tires the soul that aims only at pleasing You? Oh, powerful love of God, how different are your effects from those of the world's love! This latter love doesn't want company since company would seem to oblige it to give up what it possesses. In the case of the love of my God, the more lovers that love knows there are, the more it increases; and so its joys are tempered by seeing that not all enjoy that good. O my God, what is this that happens: in the greatest favors and consolations coming from You, the memory grieves over the many there are who don't want these consolations and over those who will lose them forever! So the soul looks for ways to find company, and willingly sets aside its joy when it thinks it can be of some help that others might strive to enjoy it.
2. But, my heavenly Father, wouldn't it be more worthwhile to leave aside these desires until a time when the soul has less experience of Your favors, and now be completely occupied in enjoying You? Oh, my Jesus, how great is the love You bear the children of the earth,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,15,1,3,26,0,0,3,10,11,8,8,7,2,3,0,0,2,7,0
"1137",1581,86,"for the greatest service one can render You is to leave You for their sake and their benefit -- and then You are possessed more completely. For although the will isn't so satisfied through enjoyment, the soul rejoices because it is pleasing You. And it sees that while we live this mortal life, earthly joys are uncertain, even when they seem to be given by You, if they are not accompanied by love of neighbor. Whoever fails to love their neighbor, fails to love You, my Lord, since we see You showed the very great love You have for the children of Adam by shedding so much blood. A SATIRICAL CRITIQUE
 
On the Words ""Seek Yourself in Me"" 
 
1. If obedience had not forced me, I would certainly not have answered, nor, for certain reasons, would I have accepted the role of judge. But none of my reasons is the one the Sisters here give: namely, that my brother is among the contestants and that seemingly affection will distort justice. Indeed, I love all the contestants since each of them has helped me bear my trials. My brother came along at the end of my drinking from the chalice, although he has shared in some part of it and will share in it more with the Lord's help. With the condition my head is in after the many letters and business matters I have been attending to from last night till now, I ask God to give me the grace not to say anything that might merit my being denounced to the Inquisition. But obedience can do all, and thus I will do what Your Excellency commands, whether it turns out good or bad. I have desired to enjoy myself for a while reflecting on the contestants' papers that were sent to me, but I have had no chance to do so.
 
On Francisco de Salcedo's Reply
 
2. It seems that the motto, ""Seek yourself in Me"" is said by the Spouse of our souls. Well, an indication that Señor Francisco de Salcedo errs is that he stresses so much that God is in all things; the Spouse knows that He is in all things.
3. Señor Francisco also says a great deal about the intellect and union. It is well known that in union the intellect does not work. If it does not work, how can it seek? That which he says quoting David, ""I will hear what God speaks within me,"" pleased me very much, for",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,8,1,2,1,7,1,5,28,2,0,2,10,10,6,14,8,2,6,0,2,1,5,1
"1138",1581,87,"this peace in the faculties (referred to by the word ""people"") is to be highly esteemed. But I have no intention of saying anything good about what the contestants have written. Thus, I say that the explanation is off the mark because the motto does not say ""let us hear,"" but ""let us seek.""
4. And worst of all, if he does not retract what he wrote, I will have to denounce him to the Inquisition which is nearby. For after quoting again and again throughout the entire paper words of St. Paul and the Holy Spirit, he refers, in signing his paper, to the things he wrote as stupidities. Let him correct this at once; if he doesn't he will see what happens!
 
On Julián de Avila's Reply
 
5. He began well, but ended poorly; thus, the honor should not be given to him. They didn't ask him here to explain how the uncreated and the created light are joined but how we seek ourselves in God. Nor did we ask him what a soul feels when it is united with its Creator. And if it is united with Him, how does it have an opinion about whether there is a difference or not? In this union the intellect is, I think, incapable of entering into these disputes. If it were capable, it could easily understand the difference that lies between the Creator and the creature. The contestant also says, ""when it is purified."" I believe that neither virtues nor purifications are enough here because the union is a supernatural thing, and God gives it to whom He wants. If there is something that disposes for this union, it is love. But I forgive him his errors because he did not go on at such length as did my Father Fray John of the Cross.
 
On Father Fray John of the Cross's Reply
 
6. In his answer he presents very good doctrine for anyone who might want to follow the exercises they make in the Society of Jesus but not for what we have in mind. Seeking God would be very costly if we could not do so until we were dead to the world. The Magdalene was not dead to the world when she found him, nor was the Samaritan woman or the Canaanite woman. Furthermore, he treats a great deal about becoming one with God in union. But when this union comes about and God grants the soul this favor, one would not say that the",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,10,2,3,13,0,2,0,12,11,13,13,3,1,6,1,0,1,1,0
"1140",1582,1,"1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. On our arrival in Valladolid, I arranged for the Mother Prioress there to inform you. I remained there four days because I was not well, for on top of a bad cold, I had a slight attack of palsy. Nonetheless, after improving a little, I departed because I feared making your honor wait, as well as those lords -- whose hands I kiss many times. I beg their honors and you as well not to blame me for the delay. If you all knew what the roads were like, you would blame me more for coming. I am also now in pretty bad condition, but I hope in the Lord that this will not prevent me from setting out again shortly if the weather gets a little better. They say that the trip from here to Burgos is an arduous one, and so I don't know if Father Provincial will want to depart until he sees that I am better, even though he is eager to continue the journey. He kisses your hands and has a great desire to meet you. He is very much obliged to pray for you because of all that you do for the order.
2. If it is necessary for you to send us a message, make use of a special messenger, and we will pay the cost here. In matters like this, the cost should not matter much. It could be that if the weather gets better, as it is today, we will leave Friday morning and that a letter sent by ordinary mail will not arrive on time. In case you haven't sent anything or we have already departed, here is how we plan to go.
3. Father Provincial does not want us to fail to see the crucifix in that city, and so they say that before we enter, it is necessary to go there and that from there, or a little before, notify you and go to your house in as hidden a way as possible, and if necessary to wait until nightfall. Then Father Provincial will go to receive the bishop's blessing so that on the next day the first mass may be said. You should know that until this is done, it is better that no one knows. This is what I have been almost always doing. Every time I think of how God has done everything, I am amazed and see that it is all the",2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,10,0,7,23,1,3,1,6,8,14,14,9,3,3,3,2,0,2,0
"1141",1582,2,"fruit of prayer. May he be ever praised and pleased to watch over you, for he has surely reserved a great reward for you because of your work.
4. I don't think I accomplished a small feat by bringing Asunción with me, considering the resistance to this. She is happy to come, in my opinion. Her sister is well. I have already told you that we will bring her back soon. The prioress here kisses your hands and so too do the nuns accompanying me. We include the five who will remain there and myself and two companions. In sum, there are eight of us traveling. Don't bother about beds, for we can adapt in any arrangement until we get settled. I find that these angels are pleasant and joyful.
5. May God watch over them and give you many years; don't be distressed over my sickness, for I am often like this, and it usually goes away quickly.
Today is the vigil of St. Anthony.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress, María de San José, the discalced Carmelite nuns, in back of San Francisco, Seville.
1. Jesus be with your reverence, my daughter, and watch over you for me, amen. I am writing this from Burgos where I now am. It's been twelve days since I arrived, and nothing has been done regarding the foundation. For there has been some opposition. Things are going somewhat the way they went down there. I am beginning to see how much God will be served in this monastery, how all that is happening will be for the best, bringing it about that the discalced nuns will become better known. Since this city is a kingdom, there would perhaps be no remembrance of us if we entered in silence. But this noise and opposition will do no harm, for there are already some women moved to join us even though the foundation has not yet been made. You and the sisters pray to God for this foundation.
2. The one who will bring you this letter is a brother of the lady who is allowing us to stay in her house and through whose intervention we have come to this city. We owe her very much. She has four daughters who are nuns in our houses, and two others who I think will do the same. I say this so that you will be very gracious to him, if he goes there. His name is Pedro de Tolosa.
3. By means of him you can",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,1,15,0,3,15,1,1,0,8,10,3,12,3,4,3,1,1,1,1,1
"1142",1582,3,"answer me, and you can even send me the money. And for goodness' sake do all you can and send the entire amount, for I am obliged by contract to pay it this year. Don't send it to me the way you did the other money, or I will become angry with you. For by sending it in the way I mentioned, through Pedro de Tolosa, the money will come safely. It will suffice for you to give it to him, and he will deliver it here. If you can in some way show him some kindness, for goodness' sake do so. We won't be losing anything, and we owe it to his sister.
4. Our Father Provincial has been here and has been very efficient in all that has to be done. He is in good health. May God watch over him as is our need. I also have Teresita with me, for they told me that her relatives wanted her to leave the monastery, so I didn't dare have her stay behind. She is virtuous in a very pleasant way. She sends her regards to you and to all the sisters. Give them my best and ask them not to fail to pray for me. The sisters I brought here send there regards. They are very good nuns and bear the trials with a wonderful spirit.
5. Traveling along the way, we got into serious dangers because the weather was so harsh that the attempt to cross the rivers and torrents was bold. As for myself, the trip must have done me harm, for ever since Valladolid, I have had a bad sore throat (and continue to have one). Although they have tried different remedies, it doesn't go away. Now I am better, but I can't eat anything that has to be chewed. Don't be upset, for with the help of God and all your prayers it will soon go away. Such is the reason this letter is not in my own hand. The sister who is writing it asks you in your charity to pray for her.
May he watch over you for me and make you holy, amen.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
6. See that your answer is a long one. You can do so through the person who is giving you this, for it is a long time since I have seen a letter from you. My regards to Mother Subprioress and to all the nuns. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with",3,2,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,6,15,0,8,16,1,2,2,4,5,4,8,8,4,0,1,2,2,0,2
"1143",1582,4,"your honor. We are getting along well in the hospital, glory to God. I am reminded here of all the merit you gain in yours. It is a great thing to take part in a work like this. Blessed be God who so takes care of the poor. This is indeed consoling to me.
2. The archbishop has sent someone to see me and ask if I need anything. For my consolation he said that finally out of regard for the Bishop of Palencia, for me, and for all those who have been praying for this foundation he will give his authorization -- as soon as we have a house -- for it is out of the question that we go back to where we came from, which makes one suspect that someone asked him to send us back.
3. These fathers are defending themselves vigorously and are complaining about me because I wrote to the lord canon, something they say they would never have done. I don't know who could have told them, although it matters little to me. Now, as soon as we left the house of Catalina de Tolosa, they went to see her. And they sent me word that I shouldn't tire myself in trying to get them to come to see us, for unless their general in Rome gives them orders to do so, they will not come to see us until we have a monastery. They don't want to give the impression that their order and ours is all one order -- look at that for an idea! -- and that half of Palencia is in revolt because of what I wrote. I have recounted this so that Lord Canon Reinoso will know about it and to beg both of you not to try to help me in this regard. They know what they are doing. The day will appear when others will come with a different attitude.
4. The fact is that if we want to make a foundation, we must have a house. And so we are waiting for these sisters to make the renunciation, for until they do so Catalina de Tolosa can do nothing although she would like to. Even while we are here, she showers us with favors and takes wonderful care of us. Now we are conferring about a house for which it is said they are asking two thousand ducats; and that's a gift, for it is very well built, so much so that the sisters will not",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,1,8,0,1,15,0,0,0,6,7,10,8,7,5,3,0,0,2,0,0
"1144",1582,5,"have to do anything to it for many years. It is however in a bad area. It belongs to Fulano de Mena. But we are not wanted in a place that is very central. There are so few places, that even though the house has some small defects, we desire it very much.
5. I had finished writing this when they sent to tell me that if we didn't have the two thousand ducats we would have to pay nine thousand maravedis in rent -- and would be required to put down six hundred ducats to be redeemed -- which has discouraged us. If we had the means, it would be wonderful, for we would never have to spend anything on it for many years, and a beautiful church is ready. Tell me what you think and how you are. Since I am used to receiving frequent letters from you, I am not resigned to doing less. Let Canon Reinoso take this as addressed to him too. May our Lord watch over your honor for me, as I beg of him, amen.
Today is the first of February.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus To my beloved daughters, Sister María de San José and Sister Isabel de la Trinidad, Carmelites.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with you, my daughters. I received your letter and the document. As often as you write me, it will be a consolation for me. It would also be one for me to respond if I didn't have so many things to do, and because of these duties I cannot answer every time.
2. I am delighted that you are now foundresses, for I tell you that certainly if you had not helped in this need, I don't know where I could have found the means to buy a house. Although Señora Catalina de Tolosa desired to buy one, she couldn't do any more than she was already doing. So it was ordained by God that you would be able to do this. Since the archbishop did not want to give the license unless we had our own house and since we didn't have the deposit needed to buy one, see what a troublesome situation we would have been in. With your help, even though the money is not all given at once but just a little, we can buy a good house, with God's help.
3. Praise him very much, my daughters, for you are the source of so great a work; not everyone deserves this grace",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,9,10,0,5,12,0,0,2,6,7,19,11,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0
"1145",1582,6,"that he has given to mother and daughters. Don't feel sad about what we have suffered here, for this shows how disturbed the devil is and will serve to bring more prestige to this house. I hope in God that when we have our own house, the archbishop will give the license. Never be disturbed, my daughter, that we suffer, for so much is gained by this.
4. You should know that Elenita de Jesús will make a great nun. She is with us and we are very happy with her. Teresa is better. She sends her best regards and so does Madre Tomasina and all the nuns, and they thank you very much for what you have done, and will pray to God for you.
May His Majesty watch over you for me, amen; and may he make you holy.
Your charity's,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress at St. Joseph's in Seville.
I was amused by the authority you show with your bell, and if it gets one hopping, as you say, you are right. I hope in God that your house will advance far, for they have suffered much. You say everything so well that if my opinion were followed, they would elect you foundress after my death. And even if I were living I would be eagerly in favor, for you know much more than I do -- and are better; that is the truth. I have the advantage over you through having a little experience. But not much attention should be paid to me any more, for you would be startled to see how old I am and how incapable of anything, etc. 1. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, mi padre. A short time has passed since I wrote you, and our Father Provincial will have already given you an account of what has taken place here with the archbishop and how he said that we must buy a house. Give glory to God, for we have now bought one, and a very good one. We would like to leave this hospital because we are very crowded and would like to see where this whole affair is going to end up.
2. The archbishop said that the house is a good one and that he is pleased with it. But the suspicion of everyone is that he is not about to do anything more than he has done up until now. And so I would like to have authorization from the nuncio to have Mass at",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,5,5,13,1,9,22,4,0,4,5,8,14,12,5,3,4,1,0,2,0,0
"1146",1582,7,"home. With this we could endure the long delay. And so I am writing a letter to the duchess to enclose with this one that she might write us a letter of support. Would you read it and send it to her, in charity, sealing it first. Be sure you arrange to receive an answer and send it to Padre Nicolao or to Juan López in Madrid, and put in writing what must be done so that the authorization will be received quickly. Realize that you are doing us the greatest charity, for although the house is near a church, it is hard for us to have to go out to hear Mass.
3. If you think that by your asking the duke in my name, he would respond positively, the authorization might perhaps come more quickly -- and I figure it would be something easy to get. As I said in the letter to the duchess, the house has a chapel, which was not used for anything except the celebration of Mass. But also, the Society had lived in the house where we were wanting to make the foundation and the Blessed Sacrament had been reserved there for fourteen years. The archbishop, however, never allowed us to have Mass there. If you had heard all the nice words about what he desired, you would have thought there was nothing else to do but ask. It doesn't seem it depended on him, for certainly the devil very much regretted our making this foundation. So there is no reason to think the archbishop will give the authorization once we have our own house. We could have to wait a long time before he becomes tired enough to give it to us.
4. I would very much like to know if you gave my letters to those gentlemen and if anything was done. Whatever the case, nothing is lost by trying. In your charity, don't forget to do me this favor.
5. Padre Fray Antonio's manner of proceeding was so painful to me that I decided to write the enclosed letter. If you think he will not resent it too much, seal it and the others as well and send them to him, for I don't know any other way of sending them.
6. Greetings to Licentiate Padilla and to Padre Fray Antonio de la Madre de Dios. These sisters send greetings to you.
May God watch over you and make you as holy as I beg of him.

"1147",1582,8,"Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence and watch over you for me. You should know that we have now moved into the house and are hurrying to adapt it to our needs. May it be His Majesty's will that everything end well and that we obtain the license to remain there, and that the other stipulations not oblige us to abandon it.
2. Now they are angry with me for having taken possession. I have written again to the bishop to ask him to write a letter of supplication. We will see if it has any effect. You could also, if you think it would help, ask him to do us this favor so that he will write as soon as possible. I don't think I will be able to write to him with this mail, for it is already very late. In any case, I have decided to write to the bishop, as I have said, about the matter I pointed out to you in this letter.
3. As for my health, I am now beginning to feel better, although not completely. I am happy about our house, for it is a very cheerful one. Praise God for having brought this about.
4. I am not writing to Medina because it is already late. Give them my greetings and tell them that I will write on another day. My regards to Mother Subprioress and all the other nuns. Those in this house are doing well, and Teresa goes from good to better, glory to the Lord. She sends her regards to you and to all the nuns, and she always prays to God for you that he will be always with you.
Today is 26 March.
5. I kiss the hands of all those lords and of Canon Reinoso; tell him that I had begun to write to him, but then I didn't have the time.
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence, mi padre. It's a trial to have to be in such far away places and without your reverence, which displeases me very much. May God give you health. There must have been a great need in that house if our padre agreed to allow you to be separated from him. The humility of your letter made me very happy, even though I don't plan on doing what you say so that you learn to suffer. Look, mi padre, all beginnings are difficult, and so this one of yours will be so for now.

It would be better to have no learning than to show this so soon. You shouldn't think that the business of governing lies in always knowing your faults, for it is necessary so as to carry out your office to forget yourself often and recall that you stand in the place of God. He will give you what you lack, for this is what he does with everyone since no one is perfect. So don't be shy and fail to write to our padre about the way things appear to you.
3. A short time ago, I sent another packet of letters to you through Señora Doña Juana.
May God watch over you and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus One sees clearly how different your cares are from mine, and you should know that the reason I didn't send anything is that I couldn't. I was consoled and gave thanks to God that things are going so well for you in the house of Señor Perálvarez, your uncle. Give him my many regards, because I am very grateful for the favor that he and his wife have shown you. I don't have time to write to them now. I'll do so on another day by mail. It's a great favor from God that you have been freed from the pestilence of that woman. To my lady and sister Doña Juana de Ahumada.
1. May Jesus be with your honor. I am well, although so busy that I would rather not have to write you now. Blessed be God that Señor Juan de Ovalle is well. By no means should you allow him to come here, for that would be a risk for him. It would have been better had you sent the letters to the Indies by the same way you sent the packages, for the letters you send never reach their destination over there. My greetings to Señora Doña Magdalena, who I was happy to hear is better, and to the children.
2. Fray Diego is here, although I haven't seen much of him. If he can, he will go to visit you. Mother Prioress and my companion are well. As for myself, I am feeling so much better that I would be surprised if it lasted. May the Lord do his will, and may he be with you.

In the Incarnation ...
Yours truly,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Since you left Spain, I have been so busy and in such poor health that I can be excused for not having written before. But I did not fail to share in your joy over the brother-in-law given you by the Lord. Señora Doña María wrote to me about it and also begged me to pray to God for some business matters of yours since it doesn't seem that you are lacking trials. May he be praised for everything.
2. These sisters and I have prayed for this intention and would like to know if the tempest has passed. I always have and will have care about such request for prayers, however wretched I am, since I am obliged to have it. I don't consider it bad that in the midst of so much prosperity from God you experience some adversity, since this is the path along which he has led all his chosen ones. Now it seems we are at peace here, as you will learn from Padre Nicolao de Jesús María since he is the one bringing this. And since you will also learn from him everything that I could say here, I won't go on with any more. May our Lord watch over you and help you progress in his service.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
3. I hadn't heard anything about the good Bishop of the Canaries until a little before he embarked. He was well. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your most illustrious lordship. I shared so much in your joy that I have wanted to let you know about it, for certainly my happiness has been great. May it please our Lord to make it complete by helping my lady the duchess at the time when she gives birth, and may he preserve you in good health for many years.
2. I kiss the hands of her excellency many times, and I beg her not to fear but to have much confidence, for our Lord who has begun to grant us a favor will bring everything to completion. The Sisters and I will take very special care to beg His Majesty for this intention.

Yet truly I have not been neglectful of you in my poor prayers but very mindful -- whatever be their worth -- and will be so always. And I have keenly felt your illnesses. Please God they have gone away, and may he watch over you for many years.
From Burgos, 18 April,
Your most illustrious lordship's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. ... it seems the arrival of the king has been delayed, and I beg you to give the cardinal an account for me of how well this foundation has been made, even though the archbishop held off from giving the permission. In sum, settle the matter there according to what you think. If Señora Doña Luisa is not there, write to her for me, for I don't have time to do so now. I felt her trials deeply.
2. May God give you the quiet rest that I desire for you. To be sure, you are an old friend who cannot bear to see me with sufferings; you indeed owe me this.
Today is the feast of St. George. Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
My best regards to Madre Brianda de San José ... For Sister Leonor de la Misericordia, Soria.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your charity, my daughter. Although it is night and the clock will be striking one while I am writing this, I did not want to miss sending you this letter. I have been wanting to find a mail carrier for Soria and have written for one, but I don't know what happened to my letters, and they don't take much care there about writing to me. Now the one who is bringing this to you is someone who will be able to give you an account of what is going on here. And I would like you to give an account of what is going on with you to this father of your soul in all openness and let yourself find consolation in his words, for he knows how to bring relief in every way. I am delighted that you will get to know him.
2. Because the lad he is bringing with him must return, let me know, for goodness' sake, how you are, whether you are happy and about everything else -- I pray much for you -- and tell me what Señor Don Francés has done, for they have told me",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,11,0,4,17,1,0,4,13,7,6,8,8,2,1,2,0,2,0,0
"1151",1582,12,"that he still hasn't decided against marrying, which has surprised me very much; I want him to succeed in serving our Lord.
3. Señora Doña María de Beamonte has been sick for some days. Write to her and to Doña Juana. Thank her for the favor they have done us. And remain with God, for the head can do no more. Give Padre Vallejo a warm greeting for me and ask him to tell our padre about anything that might need correction in that house.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
4. You can speak to our padre about Pamplona. The Lord will guide everything if it is to be for his service. But if we would have to build from the beginning, I don't think it would be suitable. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Our Father Provincial asked me to tell you that he received a letter from his father who was going to Rome and said that on his way he would stop to speak with him in Soria. So Father Provincial could not delay and had to leave this morning. He would very much have liked to see you, but he was so busy yesterday that he couldn't. I beg you to pray for him. We are left very much alone. For this reason I beg you to remember that from now on you have daughters and that I am so wretched that you must not forget me. Mother Prioress and all the nuns kiss your hands.
2. They say the reception of the habit will take place on Friday. His excellency will give it. May God give us himself so that we don't feel these absences and may he watch over you with a great increase in sanctity. Before you speak with any of the clergy about staying here, you need to speak to me. But if you do come across someone, don't let the opportunity pass.
Your honor's unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Three days ago I received your letter and was truly delighted to know that you are well. May our Lord give you the health I beg of him. You don't need to urge me to do what I am obliged to do for you. Concerning the poor health of Señora Doña María, I have nothing to say, for I know that our Lord seeks to give something good to you and to her with such a",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,17,0,1,19,0,0,1,7,1,14,12,5,2,7,3,2,3,1,0
"1152",1582,13,"continuous trial. Although I have had some trials here, for I have had an unpleasant illness from which I am still not freed, your trial has pained me more.
2. I indeed believe that you rejoice in all the good things that happen to this order; our Lord will reward you as he can. But if you saw the trials that were suffered in this project, the good outcome would make you even happier. Blessed be God who has done this. I kiss the hands of Señora Doña María.
3. I desire a foundation in that place very much, and I am making every effort I can. When our Lord is pleased, things will work out. Until then, there isn't much I can do. The enclosed letters were sent to me from Granada for you. May our Lord watch over you for many years.
From this house of St. Joseph in Burgos, 14 May.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence. Because the messenger is in such a hurry that he finds it difficult to wait for this, I am only going to say that I was annoyed that you would go to the extreme of accepting another blood sister in a community where there are already two. I don't see that it is yet time to transfer one who is already there.
2. You should not in any way give your consent for those two sisters to write to Don Luis what their father says, nor even a word that could be taken for a request; rather you should tell them that in no way will she be received there since there are already two others. And tell them they should ask him not to talk about this, for it will make them very unhappy. And see that nothing different is done. When the next messenger comes I will write again.
3. Tell him that when a monastery is founded in Madrid, you will try to do something, but that for now the charity that was extended to the two is sufficient.
Today is 14 May, for I have no time to write more.
I was delighted to see a letter with your handwriting.
Your Reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your honor. Not knowing where Casademonte is living, I cannot avoid giving you some work ...
Our padre was here last week. He is doing well and was on his way to Soria. From there he has to make some more rounds, which is disturbing to me since much time will",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,1,1,10,0,8,15,2,1,2,4,10,9,9,3,6,2,2,2,3,1,0
"1153",1582,14,"pass without our having any news of him ... For my dear daughter Sister Leonor de la Misericordia.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor, my daughter. Oh, how I wish I had no other letters to write than this answer both to your letter that came through the Jesuits and to the latest one. Believe me, daughter, that every time I see a letter from you, it brings me special delight. So I don't want the devil to tempt you to neglect writing to me.
2. Regarding the temptation that makes you think you are not making progress, you will gain in a wonderful way -- time will provide the testimony. God is leading you as though you were someone he already has within his palace, who he knows will never leave and to whom he desires to give more and more by which you can merit. Up until now it could be that you received those little feelings of tenderness because God in wanting to detach you from everything found this necessary.
3. I remember a saint I knew in Avila, for certainly it was clear that she lived the life of a saint. She had given everything she had to God, but kept a mantle to wear, and afterward she gave that away. Then God granted her a period of great interior trial and dryness. Afterward she complained very much to him and said: ""Is this the way you are, Lord? After leaving me with nothing, then you yourself also leave me?"" So, my daughter, this is the way His Majesty is, for he repays great services with trials; and there can be no greater pay because those trials make the love of God increase in us.
4. I praise you, for interiorly you are advancing in the practice of virtue. Leave your soul to God; it is his spouse. He will be responsible for it and lead it to the place that most suits it. Also, the novelty of the life and practices seems to drive away that peace, but afterward it will return. Don't be at all distressed by this. Prize being able to help God carry the cross and don't be clinging to delights, for it is the trait of mercenary soldiers to want their daily pay at once. Serve without charge, as the grandees do the king. The king of heaven be with you.
5. Regarding my departure, I am answering Señora Doña Beatriz and will mention the important things.
This Doña Josef of",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,2,18,0,5,19,2,0,2,10,8,6,5,8,1,1,2,1,3,1,0
"1154",1582,15,"hers is a good soul, certainly, and very much suited for us. But she is so beneficial to that house that I don't know whether it would be right to get her to leave it. So I resist this as much as I can, and I am afraid of stirring up enmities. If the Lord so desires, it will come about.
My regards to those lords, those brothers of yours whom I know.
May God watch over you and make you what I desire.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
6. I forgot to mention how happy our padre was with you (he couldn't finish praising you), and to ask Mother Prioress why they don't move the refectory downstairs, where with wooden platforms things would work out all right. It would involve much work for those who serve the food to have to carry up wood, and water, and all the rest, whereas this other arrangement would seem to be easier to manage. Your lordship ought not grieve the sudden death of Padre Hernandálvarez del Aguila, for there is someone who has seen him in heaven among the holy confessors there.
  To the illustrious Canon Reinoso, Palencia.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Whenever I see a letter from you, I feel consoled. And it pains me that I cannot give myself frequently the comfort that comes from writing to you. I know that you realize this, and nonetheless it bothers me not to be able to do more.
2. Through my letter to Father Rector Juan del Aguila, which is enclosed and which Mother Prioress will show you, you will learn something of what is going on with the Society, for it truly seems that a manifest enmity is beginning to take shape. And the devil bases it on accusations of things for which they ought to thank me. Truly serious calumnies are being spread, some of which they themselves are responsible for. It all ends up with these despicable interests that they say I wanted and strove after, and it's a relief that they didn't add ""thought about."" And since I believe that they wouldn't tell a lie, I see clearly that the devil must have a hand in this muddle.
3. Now they told Catalina de Tolosa that they didn't want her to have anything to do with the discalced nuns lest she be contaminated by our manner of prayer. To the devil it must be very important to promote quarrels between us since he has",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,1,0,18,2,8,16,1,1,1,11,6,15,8,9,4,1,2,1,1,0,2
"1155",1582,16,"become so active. They also told her that their general was coming here, that he had already disembarked. I recall that he is a friend of Señor Don Francisco. If he could undo these machinations and establish silence by learning the truth, it would be a great service to God. That people so serious should be engaged in such childishness is a pity. Would you look into this and in conformity with what you think apply a remedy.
4. Those papers must be really tiring you. I beg you to send them to me, as soon as you find a very safe means, and pray for me to our Lord. May His Majesty watch over you, as I beg of him, amen.
Today is 20 May. I kiss the hands of both Señor Don Francisco and those ladies, your aunts.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus God reward you, my daughters, for having shown me so much charity. And who other than you should have done this and helped me in a time of so much need? I tell you that God wil never fail you, and may he bless you for me. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and may he give you on this feast a great plenitude of his love, as I beg of him. May he repay you for what you give me with your letters, which is very great; and which is so with the most recent one. It would make me very happy, since you are in Madrid, if God were to ordain the establishment of that foundation because I would also then be able to communicate with you more and be near his most illustrious lordship. I was delighted that you did not stay long enough in Toledo for the heat to arrive, and I praise our Lord for the good health he gives his lordship. May God be pleased to preserve him for many years; when founding a house, we begin to pray for such an intention.
2. The foundation here has now been completed, glory to God. I have always had poor health in this place. Nonetheless, I wouldn't want to leave except to go to Madrid. This is what I wrote to his lordship. And afterward, please God, I want to do no more traveling, for I am very old and tired.
3. Here some are saying that the king already wants to go there; others say he will not go there so soon. Regarding the foundation,",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,2,21,0,3,23,0,0,2,6,7,16,13,5,2,3,1,1,4,2,0
"1156",1582,17,"it seems it would be more fitting that it be already made when he arrives, if the cardinal were to give his consent. I trust that His Majesty will enlighten him about the best thing to do and that he might want to grant me a favor. Yet I would not want to be a bother. But, since his illustrious lordship has so many things to do, and I know this to be for the service of our Lord, I would not want it to be neglected because of a lack of effort on my part. And so I am reminding him, feeling very certain that God will give him the light to do what is best and at the best time.
May His Majesty watch over you, as I beg of him, amen.
From this house of St. Joseph in Burgos, on the second day of this feast of the Holy Spirit.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Our Father Provincial.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, mi padre. I still do not have an answer to the letters I sent you with a private messenger, and I desire a response very much so as to know how your health is. It has been somewhat comforting to me that so far we have had continually cold weather here. I hope that it will not be as hot down there as usual. May God do what he sees as necessary. I hold that it is taxing for you to be traveling about in this weather, so it would be a relief for us to have more frequent news of you. I have a strong desire that you not delay there and that the thought not even enter your mind to go to Seville, whatever may be the need, for they are definitely undergoing a pestilence down there.
2. For the love of our Lord, do not give in to the temptation to go and ruin us all, at least me. Although God gives you health, the danger you place your health in is enough to take mine away up here ...
Finding the money to pay the expenses will be no small task, for she wants everything to be perfect and her brother will not give anything for now. Behold the nice seasoning to go with the poverty in which we are all walking! If you find anyone in Malagón who will lend us five hundred ducats -- I mean to say, if the prioress should have",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,5,13,0,4,16,0,2,2,10,5,17,12,7,2,1,3,0,3,1,0
"1157",1582,18,"them -- I would accept them gladly, since that is not much for so many nuns. The main thing is that here, mi padre, I don't think they will ever be in need. For now, there will be some struggle.
3. As for finding someone to say Mass for us, we haven't succeeded. It will be necessary for now -- and all our friends think so -- to have a friar come. Since you had the same idea in your letter, we were all very happy. I don't find anyone like Fray Felipe, for I know that he is very distressed there and doesn't do anything but send me letters. As a result he cannot be kept there much longer in so unhappy a state. If he comes here, we will have a confessor, and he will be better off than down there ...
4. You should know, mi padre, that the prioress in Toledo writes me that she is very ill, and indeed it is for me a matter of conscience because of what she endures there, for truly the climate is killing her. I have thought, if you agree, that even though they elected her there -- for if they hadn't it would be strange -- you could bring her to Avila. That way two things could be done: first, test her health; second, she could leave a president there of her own choice, and one could see how that one does without being a prioress. It would be a difficult burden for Avila if she is so sick, but also if she is well it would be very beneficial. And accepting her is something they owe her, for every year since St. Joseph's was founded eight hundred ducats are given for her. There are many difficulties in this regard, but she has worked hard within the order, and I couldn't bear just leaving her to die.
5. You will see there what is best; and realize that she has been tempted to think that you don't like her, and the letter that you wrote her about not touching the money made her think that you consider her to be a spendthrift. I have already written to her about your aim for them, which is that they have an income and little by little build a chapel.
6. These nuns can be a burden for you, mi padre; but you are indeed indebted to them, for they have deeply felt your trials, especially in Toledo...
7. ... if it isn't acquired",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,3,4,2,9,14,2,1,1,17,8,17,11,8,2,1,3,0,3,0,0
"1158",1582,19,"by the fixed date, we are left without knowing what to do about the monastery, and the danger is great that they will spend what they have for buying one. In sum I have written to them not to turn away Cristóbal Juárez until you get there, for you will see from everything what is best to do. The walls are almost finished. Only one is made of clay; the others are of lime and stone.
8. May God watch over you for me. I wouldn't want to ever end this. My throat feels as usual, and no worse. Otherwise, I am fine and everything is going well, glory to God. Don't let this sadden you, for because of what I owe His Majesty and the favors he grants me each day, it is good to suffer something.
9. I beg you to give heed to this matter about the friar. And if you can't send the one mentioned, send another you might think good for this office, for these souls are very good and tranquil.
Today is 25 June. Yesterday was the feast of St. John. The friends are well.
Your reverence's servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of the Carmel of St. Joseph. The discalced Carmelite nuns behind San Francisco. Postage, one half real.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, amen, amen. Yesterday I received a letter from you which, although there were only a few lines, brought me the greatest delight, for I was very afflicted over what they told me about so many people dying. I am praying urgently to God for you, as they are doing in all these houses, for I sent to ask them for their prayers. I feel anxious at every moment to think of you amid so many trials.
2. I already knew of the death of Padre Fray Diego, and I praised God that Padre Fray Bartolomé remains, for I was very grieved that he might die, for this would have been a great loss to you. May God be praised for all that he does.
3. I would have liked to have been told of this letter so that my answer could have been in my own hand, but I was informed only now when the letter carrier is ready to leave and my head is very tired, for I have been writing the whole afternoon. But even if they aren't in my own hand, I didn't want to neglect sending these few lines.
4. I haven't",3,2,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,3,18,4,8,19,1,1,5,8,2,8,8,7,2,0,4,4,1,0,0
"1159",1582,20,"mentioned how amused I was by your complaints regarding the Mother Prioress in Granada, and rightly so. For she should rather be thankful for what you did in sending the nuns in so dignified a manner -- and not riding some donkeys, for God and the whole world to see. Even had you sent them by litter, I wouldn't have been upset if nothing else was available. May God preserve you, my daughter, for you did very well. And don't worry about it if someone thinks otherwise. They are only quibbling. She must have been displeased because in the making of that foundation things weren't done according to their plan. But I think everything will be all right. Even if there is some trial, the outcome isn't worse for that reason.
5. This house is in very good condition, well established and paid for, and the nuns for many years will have no need to work to support themselves. So I think I will soon start on my way back to Avila. Pray to God for me. My throat continues as usual, as do my other infirmities.
6. Greetings to Padre Fray Bartolomé and to all the Sisters. Those who are here send you their regards. Pray for Teresa, who is a little saint and has a great desire be a professed nun. May God guide her and preserve you and make you very holy.
From this house of St. Joseph's in Burgos, 6 July.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your charity, my daughter, and may he watch over you and give you the health I desire for you, for it has greatly grieved me that you are not well. Do me the charity of pampering yourself. And what they tell me in these parts about what the Sisters are doing with you delights me very much, for if they didn't behave this way, they would be acting badly. You should be as happy with the comforts as you are without them, for obedience will consider whether you need them or not, and in fact that's what it's doing. Please God, my daughter, that the illness will not get worse. Let me know, when you have a messenger, if you are better, for I am worried.
2. What I said to you in the other letter, I would like to say often, if I could see you. But this won't take place so soon, for the cardinal has written me promising to give me the permission when the king",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,3,14,1,7,18,3,0,1,6,8,18,14,5,3,2,0,1,2,0,0
"1160",1582,21,"returns, and they are already saying that he is coming. But however soon, it won't be until September or later. Don't be sad about this, for I would be as happy to see you as you me. Since this cannot happen now, God will arrange it in another way. I am in such poor health that I am in no condition to travel either down there or anywhere else, although I am better than I was some days ago. May God be praised.
3. I took some pills, and so I didn't write this letter myself, for I don't dare.
May God give you an abundance of grace, my daughter, and do not forget me in your prayers.
It is 6 July.
Your charity's servant,
Teresa of Jesus For Mother Prioress of the Carmel of St. Joseph, the discalced nuns behind San Francisco. Seville. Postage, one half real.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter, and protect you for me from all those tribulations and dangers of death.
2. Your letter was a great consolation in that you tell me the nuns are not sick -- not even a headache. It doesn't surprise me that they are well considering the prayers that are offered for them in every house; they even ought to be saints after so many supplications. I at least am ever concerned about all of you and will never forget you. Believe me you must not be ready, since you are not dying along with so many others being removed by God from that city. May the Lord watch over them for me, and over you in particular, for certainly your dying would grieve me terribly. The death of Father Vicar grieved me, and it would have been worse had it been Padre Fray Bartolomé because of how much your house would have missed him. May God be praised for all things, because in every way we are obliged to Padre Bartolomé.
3. I read a letter from Pedro de Tolosa -- which his sister gave me where he says that the situation in that city is improving, which was better news than in your letter. I also told his sister to give him my thanks for what he does for your house. Pray much for him and for his sister, Catalina de Tolosa -- our whole order ought to do this -- for after God this house owes its existence to her, and I think God will be served very much in it. When he comes there,",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,4,3,20,6,7,14,0,1,4,3,5,7,10,10,2,2,0,0,4,0,0
"1161",1582,22,"give him my best regards. And pray for me. My health continues as usual.
4. I plan, God willing, to leave at the end of this month for Palencia. Our padre left word there that I should spend a month in that house. Then I must go for the profession of Teresa, for she has finished her year of novitiate and desires to make her profession. Pray for her, you and all the nuns, with great care at this time that God will give her his grace. Consider how she needs it; for although she's lovely, she's only a child after all.
5. I already sent your letter to Padre Fray Pedro de la Purificación, for he is in Alcalá as vice-rector. Our padre left him there when he passed through. And I think he misses him very much. Now, they told me, he is in Daimiel and will be in Malagón, and that he is well, thanks be to God.
6. Many regards to all the sisters and give those who have had relatives who died my condolences and assurance of prayers. Regards in particular to Mother Subprioress, San Jerónimo, and San Francisco. Tell them I would be delighted to write to them if I could, but my health is of no assistance to me, and that is why this is not written in my own hand. I am no worse, however, than usual, but my head is tired and I don't dare push myself with these letters, for there are others required by courtesy that cannot be avoided.
May God be blessed and give you his grace, amen.
It is the fourteenth of July.
7. I received a letter from good Padre Nicolao, which made me happy. He is already in Genoa and feeling fine, for the trip by sea went very well. And he has received news that our most reverend Father General will be there within ten days. Padre Nicolao will discuss all the business matters with him there, and then return without going any further. This made me very happy. Pray for him and for his mother, who has died. He urges us very much to do this, and in your house there you truly owe it to him.
8. For goodness' sake don't fail to write me about how things are going for you. You already see how worried I am, they will forward me your letters from here. May the Lord be pleased to grant me the favor of keeping you in good health and watching over you",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,3,12,2,5,21,2,0,2,3,7,7,5,7,2,0,2,2,4,0,0
"1162",1582,23,"especially. All the nuns here are well, are happy with how things are going, and send their regards.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
Give my best to Fray Bartolomé. To Madre Tomasina Bautista, Burgos.
1. Jesus be with your reverence, mi madre, and make you a saint. I so delighted in your letter that it would seem I hadn't seen you only a few days ago. May God give you health and preserve you for me, also Sister Beatriz de Jesús, whose illness weighed on me very much. I am already praying for her. Tell her this and give her my regards.
2. As for the parlor: when Catalina de Tolosa goes away, close the part that was opened at the time of the flood. And if Catalina de Tolosa remains there, leave it as it is, but do not allow anyone else to have access to it. And as I say, if afterward she should desire to return, there would be little that would have to be removed, just a partition wall. And you could give her a room if she so desires. But a window should be so positioned that the garden cannot be viewed through it. For they have already seen us enough.
3. My throat is better, for I haven't felt so well in days. Since I can eat without any pain hardly, and today there is a full moon, I think it's important. My room is very cool and nice, and the whole house seems nicer than I thought it would. Everything is so neat that it couldn't appear bad.
4. Teresa sends you her regards. She doesn't seem so gracious as she did when in Burgos. All the sisters are well, as is also Mother Prioress. They send you their regards, and I send mine to Mother Subprioress and to all the sisters, and to Catalina de Tolosa, to Beatriz and Lesmitos, to Doña Catalina and her mother, and all the friends. St. Bartholomew sends her best to you and to all the sisters, and to your young ones. As for giving my greetings to friends, you may do it for me always, even if I don't mention it to you. I give you the permission to represent me.
5. I have observed how they do the washing here, using no more than two sisters and thought that you could do this there if María enters, and this would be cheaper for you. Consider this carefully, for I am not suggesting it unless it would be more beneficial. The",2,5,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,1,6,0,2,19,0,0,0,8,6,18,14,7,2,1,2,1,3,0,2
"1163",1582,24,"water there is very good. Isabel could also serve to help María with the wash.
6. I received a letter from Padre Fray Nicolás and he tells of how the general came after ten days as he had said in the other letter. He got along very well with the general and was most willingly and graciously granted what he went for. This is evident by the fact that the general made him his procurator for the entire province of discalced friars and nuns in such a way that everything going to the general must pass through his hands and be submitted to his counsel.
7. Padre Fray Nicolás's brothers got on very well with the general, and so he departed truly satisfied. Since the calced friars saw that Padre Fray Nicolás stayed in their house, they thought that he wanted to become a calced friar and they told him that if he stayed in that house they would make him prior, an office he can't bear the thought of! It could be that he is already back in this country, for he says that he wants to leave at once if he can find room on a ship. Pray much for him and give thanks for the great favor His Majesty has granted us in being in such good graces of the general. Organize a procession and give thanks to the Lord, for now nothing remains for us to do than to be very holy and use these favors for the service of God. May he be with you and give you his grace.
It is the third of August.
8. So that I can be courteous with friends, you will have to forgive this handwriting which belongs to someone else. Since I am not writing to my doctor, he will think that it wasn't possible for me to do so. Kiss his hands for me and tell him the news that makes me so happy, and for goodness' sake may all the nuns be so, since God has granted us so many favors.
May he watch over you, my friend, and make you a saint.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I looked at the address and I am grateful that in responding you removed the title ""illustrious."" I tell you that the nuns and I were very pleased with mi Lesmes. May God watch over him and make him a saint. Those two little angels bring me joy. I have asked Maruca to",1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,4,0,16,0,0,25,0,0,0,6,10,8,10,7,4,2,2,2,2,1,1
"1164",1582,25,"help me pray. She is the portress and does everything well. They both want to see you, just as I do too.
2. May the Lord hear our prayer and repay you for the favor you showed me with your letter, for I was afraid about the condition of your health. I am already desiring to see another letter with news that Beatriz is improving. May God bring this about. The letters I brought still haven't been delivered because I am waiting ...
What they did wasn't a sufficient reason for giving up all communication with them, even if during a novena that you had in the house, you didn't see any of them present. I mentioned what a bad impression that made in the city. I am taking great care to deliver the letters as soon as possible. Please God no one will send them elsewhere. Tell this to Isabel de Trazanos and give her my regards.
3. You should know that the abbess of Santa Dorotea gave me two ducats without knowing ...
Remain with God, for I have much to do ... My throat is better. I don't know how long this will last.
Today is Friday.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your honor. Blessed be God that Señor Juan de Ovalle is well, for the weakness will pass. The tertian fever has been everywhere. Around here, that's all one finds, although it has left me alone. Everything is daily getting better, glory to God. I have been well this summer. I don't know what the winter will bring, for it is already starting to cause me some disturbance; but when there's no fever, one can put up with it all.
2. Regarding the purchase of the house, I would like to know what was done. From Oropesa they wrote me of the news that the fleet had arrived in Sanlúcar, although this is not certain. I know nothing more. As soon as I know anything about my brother, I will inform you. I have the Perálvarez house ready for him.[
3. I am displeased by those fasts of the prioress. Tell her so, and that this is why I do not want to write to her or have anything to do with her. God deliver me from anyone who wants to do her own will rather than obey. If I can be of help to Señora Doña Ana, out of consideration for Señor Don Cristóbal, I'll do so gladly. We have discussed her staying in the house where",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,12,0,5,20,2,0,1,10,7,9,13,6,3,1,0,1,4,0,0
"1165",1582,26,"Doña Sancha used to live, but it is in such a state that no one could live in it. Here in the Incarnation, no one may enter except as far as the portress's office, nor can the service women go out. Her sisters, I believe, though they would like to help her, could do little for her. Because for five years they have eaten nothing but the bread supplied by the monastery, they are drained of energy -- and Doña Inés is almost always sick. They deeply regret their lack of energy. As for myself, you already know they are so bound by precepts that there is little I can do.
4. Give my best regards to the subprioress. I don't have time to write any more. Isabel Juárez is the one who came from Malagón, and most unwillingly, according to what they say. But having once expressed the desire, she was sent by the prioress; and I think that at some other time the prioress herself will come. I have many cares -- may God provide for them. My regards to Señor Juan de Ovalle and to my dear children. You don't tell me what Beatriz's illness was. May God be with them.
Today is 27 September.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
The discalced friar who is confessor here is doing great good; he is Fray John of the Cross. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I received your letter, but in regard to what you said I can do very little. When I speak about it with Madre Tomasina Bautista, such a change comes over her that from the soles of her feet to the top of her head, she says, she feels upset at the thought of returning to that house. And the reasons she gives why this would disturb the tranquility of her soul are such that no superior would order her to do so. She is now experiencing great peace, living in a very nice house, much to her liking. If you truly love her, you will rejoice over this and not want someone to come to be with you who doesn't want to. May God pardon her, for I desire your happiness so much that I wish it were possible for me to give everything you ask for. For love of God do not be afflicted, for there are many nuns in the order who can make up for the absence of Madre Tomasina.
2. If you are distressed by the thought that",1,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,12,0,4,20,3,0,1,8,6,14,13,3,0,4,1,2,3,2,2
"1166",1582,27,"Madre Juana del Espíritu Santo will remain as prioress, you need not be, for she has already written me that not for anything in the world would she accept that office again. I don't know what to say about those nuns. I fear that no prioress will last there, for they all take flight. I beg you to consider that this is your house and that God cannot be served where there is disquiet. So, it is very important that you concern yourself with them, for if they are what they should be, what can any prioress do to them? These attachments and childish ways are far from the behavior one expects from discalced nuns, and such conduct does not exist in the other houses. I can more or less figure out which ones are agitating the others, and if God gives me the health, and it is possible, I will try to go there to investigate these machinations. For it is painful for me to learn through a certain source that friars from another order were told of things that should have been kept private and that became the subject of talk even among seculars outside that city. Truly, through their childishness and imperfections, these nuns have done a great wrong to the order, for people will naturally conclude that all the other nuns are like them.
3. I beg you to tell them this and try to promote peace, for soon our padre will be going there. Do me this favor, for whoever is elected must be your servant. I tell you that if I had known some of the things they now tell me, I would have corrected them before. I will now have to do everything possible to provide a remedy.
4. I ask you to show this letter to Padre Pedro Sánchez, and to give him my respects, so that he will reprehend the culpable and not let them receive Communion so frequently. They shouldn't think that it is some small matter to upset the peace of a monastery or talk to outsiders about things so harmful to those whom the world esteems as good nuns. Ah, my lady, how differently things go where the true spirit reigns!
May God give you this spirit and preserve you for us many years with the holiness I desire.
Today is the feast of the Transfiguration.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. If I had known that you",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,1,15,0,6,15,2,1,0,10,3,13,13,9,0,1,0,0,2,0,0
"1167",1582,28,"were in this area, I would have answered your letter before, for I longed to tell you what great consolation it gave me. May the Divine Majesty repay you with the spiritual blessings that I always beg of him.
2. During the time of the foundation in Burgos, there were so many trials, so little health, and so many things to do that not much time remained for this joy. Glory to God that the work is over and done well.
3. I would very much like to go there where you are, for it would give me great happiness to speak with you in person about some things, which can't be done through letters. There aren't many instances where our Lord allows me to do my own will. May the will of His Divine Majesty be done, which is what matters.
4. I would very much like to see the biography of my lady the marchioness. My lady the abbess, your sister, must have received my letter late, but I don't think she sent me the account so that she could read it herself. You are very right in wanting so holy a life to be remembered. Please God you will include all that you have to say, for I fear you will cut it short.
5. Oh lord, how much I suffered to get the parents of my niece to leave her in Avila until my return from Burgos! Since they saw how persistent I was about it, I succeeded.
6. May God preserve you, for you take such care to favor them in everything; I hope that you will be their support. May God watch over you for many years with the holiness I always beg of him, amen.
From Palencia, 12 August 1582.
Your honor's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. May Jesus give your reverence his grace. I received your letter in Palencia but not in time for me to answer. I am doing so now, although in a great hurry because the bishop who is going to bring this wants to leave. For charity's sake, if he should go there, see to it that everyone treats him very graciously and that you have someone visit him frequently, for we owe him everything.
2. As for what regards the house, what Diego Ortiz desires to do and the plan he presented seems fine to me. If he buys that house, what follows will be very good, and that condition that is necessary in order have the house pertains more to",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,3,4,15,0,3,24,1,1,1,5,6,13,11,7,4,2,0,0,2,0,0
"1168",1582,29,"him than to us. Don't worry at all about his trouble, for he's always troubled. Do all you can to gain time.
3. With regard to Madre Brianda de San José's sister, she is not able to be either a nun or a lay Sister, not because she doesn't have good intelligence, or good judgment, or serenity, which she clearly seems to have, but because she can't do anything more than what she is doing, for she is very weak. And according to what she says nothing impedes her from giving herself to God and praying as much as she wants. Her life is set up just right for this. If she has some trials, she will have them elsewhere -- and even greater ones.
4. As for my going there now, I don't know how this could come about, for the trials I have here are frightening, and the business matters are killing me. But God can do everything. Pray to His Majesty for these intentions.
5. Give my best regards to everyone. Because I am in a hurry, I will not enlarge on this; the same reason goes for why this is not in my own hand.
Today is 26 August.
6. At the end of this month, please God, I will be in Avila. This trip by Father Provincial at this time pained me very much. May God be with him. I have already sent a personal courier to Padre Antonio de Jesús with the patent letters. If he accepts and desires to go there, everything will turn out well.
7. As I say, I am very happy with the plan, but you don't tell me how you are going to help Diego Ortiz buy the house. But any help will be worthwhile, if in moderation, and so leave the church free. It is an extremely better plan than the previous one, so you can begin discussing it immediately. And even if one proceeds slowly, building the church little by little with the income, Father Provincial will be pleased, for he takes very much to heart the good of that house. This will be seen later. In sum, I don't think we should neglect buying the house so as to build the church. That can be taken care of afterward. But first you have to see whether what is going to be given will be sufficient.
8. Keep me informed about all the details. I will be here until after the feast of our Lady in September, and then for the rest",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,5,10,1,8,15,2,1,1,6,8,8,12,8,2,2,1,2,3,0,0
"1169",1582,30,"of the month in Medina. You can write to me at either of these two places.
Regards to everyone, for I am in a great hurry.
Your reverence's servant
Teresa of Jesus 1. May Jesus give your reverence his grace, watch over you for me, and strengthen you for the many trials he sends you. I tell you, my mother, you are being treated as one who is strong. May God be praised for everything. I am reasonably well, better than usual. I don't believe I'll be here many days. As soon as a messenger whom I am awaiting arrives, I will depart. Pray for me; it weighs on me very much to move farther away from your house and from you.
2. Don't be distressed about Catalina de la Madre de Dios. It's a temptation and will pass away. Don't let her write to anybody. If she wants to write to me or to Ana, all right; but not to anyone else. If for her consolation you let her write, do not send the letters. I am delighted that the rector has gone there. Be very gracious with him and go to confession sometimes to him, and ask them to give the nuns some sermons.
3. Regarding Catalina de Tolosa, don't be surprised, for she is so burdened that first of all you need to console her, and even though she says this today, she won't do it tomorrow. Anyway, I am very much obliged to the licentiate. May God watch over him.
4. Why don't you tell the nuns the news about our padre? Mother Subprioress tells me she desires to know where he is. My regards to her and to all the nuns. I am sorry about María's illness. Blessed be God that you have help from the other Sister. Let me know how she does.
5. I don't know if I will be able to write to the licentiate; since I love him so much, I will consider it recreation to write to him if I have time. Give him my best wishes and also tell the doctor I am loaded down with things to do of a thousand kinds and to pray for me. I tell you that although you free me from the distress of having to know that the nuns are sick, there is no lack of other reasons for being distressed. When I have time I'll write you about some. Note that I don't think that I'll stay here beyond the feast of our Lady, and that",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,14,0,5,14,3,0,0,10,5,9,13,4,2,1,0,0,3,1,1
"1170",1582,31,"the books should reach the prioress in Palencia in time for her to send them to me.
6. May God watch over you for me. I don't have time for more except to ask that you always be careful not to burden the novices with many tasks until you understand what their spirits are capable of. I say this for Catalina's sake who was so overburdened that I am not surprised she was thinking she could no longer bear it. And you need to be compassionate in your speech. You think all the nuns should have your spirit, and you are very much mistaken. And believe that even though you may have an advantage over me in virtue, I have more experience. As a result, some of the things I pointed out, I would not want you to forget. May God watch over you for me; since these things are mentioned as though to my own soul, I would want you to realize that they are not said without reason.
I've already mentioned that I give you the power to extend regards for me to all my friends.
Today is 27 August.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. It is not sufficient for you to write me often in order to take away the pain, although it brought me great relief to know that you are well and the region healthy. Please God, this will continue. I have received all your letters, I think.
2. The reasons for your decision to go didn't seem to me to be sufficient. A means could have been found here for giving orders about studies and not hearing the confessions of beatas. In that way those monasteries could have gotten along for two months and you could have put the houses here in good order. I don't know why, but I so felt your absence, at such a time, that I lost the desire to write to you. As a result I didn't do so until now when I cannot avoid it. It is the day of the full moon, for I had a night that was truly wretched, and so too is the condition of my head. Up to now I had been doing better. Tomorrow I think, when the full moon is past, this indisposition will pass. The throat is better, but the trouble doesn't go away.
3. Here I had to put up with a great deal from Don Francisco's mother-in-law, whose behavior is",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,13,0,6,17,1,0,1,17,6,13,6,5,2,4,1,2,2,0,0
"1171",1582,32,"odd and who is determined to initiate a lawsuit against the validity of Lorenzo's will, and although she has no right to anything, many people favor her and some say that she does have a right. And I have been advised that if Don Francisco is to avoid total ruin, and we the expense, that an agreement be reached. This would be detrimental to St. Joseph's. But I hope in God that, since what St. Joseph's has coming to them is assured, the community will receive the entire inheritance. I was eaten up with sadness over this -- and still am -- although Teresa has carried on well. Oh, how she suffered from your not coming. Up until now we have kept it secret. On the one hand I rejoice because she is coming to understand what little reason there is for trust except in God; and even in my case, it didn't do me any harm.
4. Enclosed is a letter from Padre Fray Antonio de Jesús, which he wrote to me. I am surprised that he has turned to being my friend again -- truthfully, I have always considered him to be one. Since we are communicating again everything will go well. Even if this were not so, in no way could someone else be appointed for the elections. I don't know how it is that you didn't realize this, or that now is not the time to found a house in Rome. You don't have nearly enough men for the houses you have here, and Nicolao misses you very much, for I think it is impossible for him to tend to so many things by himself. Fray Juan de las Cuevas told me this, for I spoke with him at times. He has a strong desire that you succeed in everything. And he wishes you well to such an extent that I feel obliged to him. And he even told me that you were going against the chapter ordinances, which prescribed that in not having one's own associate another one be chosen -- I don't know if he said in the opinion of the priors -- and that he considered it impossible for you to do everything alone, that Moses took I don't know how many to assist him. I told him that there were not any capable, that not even enough could be found to fill the office of prior. He answered that this was essential.
5. After I arrived here, they told me to note",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,2,2,0,7,14,1,0,5,15,7,11,12,9,0,3,2,1,1,0,1
"1172",1582,33,"that you do not like to take talented persons with you. Now I see the reason, how they are needed elsewhere. But since the chapter is approaching, I wouldn't want to see them placing the blame on you. Consider this for the love of God and how you are going about preaching in Andalusia. I never like seeing you spend much time down there. Since you wrote me one day of the trials some underwent, God spares me the pain of seeing you undergo the same; and as you say, the devil does not sleep. At least believe that as long as you are in that region, I will be ill at ease.
6. I don't know for what purpose you have to stay so long in Seville, for they told me you will not be returning until the time of the chapter -- which greatly increased my pain, even more than if you had gone back to Granada. May the Lord direct things for his greater service. There is dire need of a vicar there. If Fray Antonio does well here, you could consider entrusting him with the task. Don't think of becoming an Andalusian; you don't have the temperament for living among them. With regard to preaching, I beg you again that even though you do not preach much, you be very careful about what you say.
7. Do not be disturbed about what happened here concerning that friar. The matter was not as serious as it seemed, and God provided a very good remedy. Nothing about it became known. The prioress is writing to you about how sick the discalced friars are, which is why the patent letter was not given to Fray Juan de Jesús, for it would be inhumane for him to leave them since he is the only one who is well, and he takes care of everything. I stopped by that house in coming here and everything seemed to be in very good order. They enjoy a good reputation in that place.
8. Concerning the matter in Salamanca, there is much to say. I tell you that it was the cause of some rough times for me, and please God a solution has been found. On account of this profession of Teresa it wasn't possible for me to go there, because it wasn't possible to bring her with me and less so to leave her behind. And more time would be needed to go there and then to Alba and return to Avila. Fortunately,",1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,2,9,0,6,14,1,1,0,13,12,10,9,3,4,3,1,1,5,1,0
"1173",1582,34,"though, Pedro de la Banda and Manrique happened to be here. I rented the house for another year; so the prioress can be at peace, and please God this will prove beneficial.
9. I tell you that she is charming. She is so much a woman that she has begun negotiations no more nor less than if she already had the license from you. And to the rector she says that everything she does is for my order (although she doesn't know about this purchase, nor does she want to, as you know) and for me because the rector is doing it at your orders. It's a devil's tangle, and I don't know what her reason is, for she will not lie. But the great longing she has for that miserable house is twisting her mind.
10. Yesterday Fray Diego came from Salamanca (the one who was here with you at the time of the visitation), and he told me that the rector at San Lázaro got involved in that matter against his will for love of me. He even went so far as to say that every time he dealt with the matter he had to go to confession afterward, since it seemed to be so contrary to God's will. But the prioress was so insistent that he couldn't do anything else, and all Salamanca was criticizing the purchase. And Doctor Solís had told her that she couldn't in conscience own it, for it wasn't safe. And that rush in my opinion caused them to resort to cunning so that I wouldn't know, and with the enclosed letter you will see how with the tax included the price came to six thousand ducats. Everyone is saying that it wasn't worth twenty-five hundred ducats and are asking how poor nuns can waste so much money. And what is worse, they don't have it. But in my opinion this is a trick of the devil to destroy the monastery, and so for now what they are trying to do is gain time in order to undo everything little by little.
11. I wrote to Cristóbal Juárez begging him not to do anything more about this until I come, which would be at the end of October. And Manrique wrote the same to the scholastic, who is his good friend. I told Cristóbal Juárez that I wanted to see how he would be paid (for they told me that he was the guarantor) and that I didn't want him to suffer any loss,",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,10,7,0,10,9,1,3,4,8,7,10,7,6,2,3,0,0,1,1,0
"1174",1582,35,"letting him know that there was nothing with which to pay him. He didn't answer me. Through Padre Fray Antonio de Jesús I am writing him again to try to prevent this. God has allowed that money be loaned to them, otherwise they would have already given it away along with that of Antonio de la Fuente. But just now I received another letter in which the prioress tells me that Cristóbal Juárez has sought the thousand ducats while waiting for Antonio de la Fuente to give them to him, and I am afraid they have deposited them already. Pray to God for this matter that every effort possible will be made.
12. Another serious drawback is that for them to move into the house of Cristóbal Juárez, the students would have to move to the new house of San Lázaro, which would kill them. I wrote to the rector not to give his consent and that I would be keeping my eye on the matter.
13. As for the eight hundred ducats they owe the nuns, don't worry, for Don Francisco says that he will pay them within a year. And the best part of all is that they don't have the money now to give. Have no fears, for I will get it. But it is more important that the students have good accommodations than for the nuns to have so large a house. Where will they find the money now to pay the interest? This whole business leaves me stupefied. If you gave them permission, why do they turn to me after the fact? If you didn't give it to them, how is it that they give away money (they gave five hundred ducats to the daughter of Monroy's brother-in-law)? And how is it they consider the matter to have reached such a stage that the prioress can write and say that it cannot be undone? May God provide a remedy, for I am certain that he will. Don't be disturbed, for we will do everything possible.
14. For love of God be careful about what you do down there. Don't believe the nuns, for I tell you that if they want something they will make you believe a thousand things. And it is better for them to find a little house like poor nuns and enter with humility (for afterward they can find something better) than to be left with many debts. If at times your absence makes me happy, it is to see you free of",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,4,14,9,1,6,12,4,1,0,8,7,9,9,5,2,2,0,1,0,1,0
"1175",1582,36,"these problems, for I would much rather go through them alone.
15. In Alba, my letter (in which I told them how annoyed I was and that I was going there) had its good effect. It will be worthwhile for me to do so. With God's favor we will be in Avila at the end of the month. Believe me, it was not fitting to continue bringing this child from place to place. Oh, mi padre, how oppressed I have felt these days. When I learned that you are well, it went away. Please God, you will get even better.
16. My regards to Mother Prioress and to all the Sisters. I am not writing to them because through this letter they will learn about me. I am happy that they are well. I urge them not to bother you, but to care for you. My regards to Padre Fray John of the Cross. St. Bartholomew sends hers to you. May our Lord watch over you, as I beg of him and free you from dangers, amen.
Your servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus 1. May Jesus give your reverence his grace. I received your letter in Palencia at a time when it wasn't possible for me to answer because I was about to continue on my journey. I'm writing from here, and I don't think they will give you the letter I sent to the bishop when he was about to leave so that he could have it delivered to you. (He had so much luggage it wouldn't be surprising if he forgot.) So I will repeat here what I said there. First of all, I ask you to send someone to see the bishop, and do so frequently as long as he is there. And if he should come to the monastery, you must all be most gracious toward him, for we owe him everything.
2. As for what regards the house, what Diego Ortiz desires to do and the plan he presented seems fine to me. If he buys that house, what follows will be very good, and that condition that is necessary in order to have the house pertains more to him than to us. Don't worry at all about his trouble, for he's always troubled. Do all you can to gain time.
3. With regard to Madre Brianda de San José's sister, she is not able to be either a nun or a lay Sister, not because she doesn't have good intelligence, or good judgment, or serenity, which she",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,3,10,0,8,18,1,3,1,8,6,11,12,9,2,1,1,0,0,0,0
"1176",1582,37,"clearly seems to have, but because she can't do anything more than what she is doing, for she is very weak. And according to what she says, nothing impedes her from giving herself to God and praying as much as she wants. Her life is set up just right for this. If she has some trials; she will have them elsewhere -- and even greater ones.
4. As for my going there now -- I don't know how this could come about, for the trials I have here are frightening and the business matters are killing me. But God can do everything. Many regards to everyone. Because I'm in a hurry, I won't enlarge on this.
Valladolid, 2 September.
5. I feel reasonably well, and I think I will depart on Monday after our Lady's feast. I won't stay in Medina long, so that I can arrive on time in Avila. But I don't think I will be able to remain there long because I will have to go to Salamanca. They are tangled up in the purchase of a house. It is very necessary that I go to them. May God provide a solution and watch over you for me, amen.
Teresa and St. Bartholomew send you their best regards.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
The carrier of this letter is Padre Fray Juan de las Cuevas, who tells me he is going there. Be very gracious to him. For mi padre, confessor of the Carmelite nuns. He is mi padre. Alba.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, mi padre. Your letter consoled me greatly. May God watch over you, for with respect to what you are doing, the house will not suffer any loss. You offer many excuses for them, and it doesn't seem bad to me that in everything you carry out your office as father. You are much indebted to the Sisters, who tell me so many things about you. After all, they are good souls, and even though the devil finds ways to disturb them, God does not cease to guide them. May his name be blessed, for at all times he shows mercy toward his creatures.
2. You have shown me great favor by removing the burden which that house was for me. Since you are their confessor, what you say is more satisfying than everything else. Please God, I will go there soon, and we can have a long talk. Pray for me. I don't have much time and many business matters",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,3,20,1,9,13,2,1,2,11,7,3,9,8,2,2,1,0,2,0,0
"1177",1582,38,"have arisen here.
3. Give my regards to Señora Teresa de Layz, for I don't think I will have a chance to write to her. You can tell her that I was delighted to receive her letter and that, God willing, all will be well. May God give you his grace.
Valladolid, the fifth of September,
Teresa of Jesus 1. Jesus be with your reverence, my daughter, and watch over you for me. I received your letters and much happiness along with them. In what regards the kitchen and refectory, I would be delighted if you did so, but you who are there can make the best decision as to the arrangement. Work things out as you wish.
2. I am glad that Roque de Huerta's daughter is pleasant. As regards the profession of the Sister you mentioned, I think it is good that it be delayed until when you say, for she's young and it doesn't matter. Don't be surprised if she experiences some setbacks, for at her age these don't amount to much. They happen, but afterward these persons are usually more mortified than others.
3. Tell Sister Leonor de la Misericordia that I would like to do for her what she asks and even more. Would that I could attend her profession. I would do so gladly and it would please me much more than a lot of other things I have to do here ... may God bring this about, if it be for his service.
4. Regarding the foundation, I will not decide to make it unless there is some income, for I see already so little devotion there that we need to proceed in such a way. And the place is so far from all our other houses that a foundation ought not be made if the community is not provided for. Here one community helps another when it sees there is need. It is good to begin in this way and that you come to know and find devoted people. If the work is desired by God, he will move these persons to do more than is being done at present.
5. I will be only a short time in Avila because I cannot neglect going to Salamanca, and you can write to me there. But if the foundation is made in Madrid -- and I am hoping for this -- I would prefer to go there since it is closer to us here. Pray for this intention.
6. Regarding that nun about whom you write, if she should",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,2,1,8,0,2,18,1,0,2,7,10,22,15,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,1
"1178",1582,39,"want to go to Palencia, I would be delighted, for they need someone in that house. I am writing to Madre Inés de Jesús so that you and she can come to an agreement about it. As for the Theatines, I am happy you are doing what you can with them, for this is necessary, and the good or the bad, and the graciousness we show them ...
7. Tell Señora Doña Beatriz for me all the things you think would be suitable. I would so like to write to her, but we are about to leave, and I have so many matters to attend to that I don't know where I'm at. May God be served by it all, amen.
8. Do not think that when I mentioned delaying the profession I was giving preference to one novice over the other, for these are worldly considerations that offend me very much, and I wouldn't want you to be looking at things like that. But it is because she is young that I am glad for a delay and so that she may practice more mortification. And if some other interpretation for this delay were made, I would give orders to have the profession at once. For it is good for the humility we profess to be evident in our deeds. I had given precedence to the other knowing that in her humility Sister Leonor de la Misericordia doesn't pay any attention to these worldly points of honor. And this being so, I am truly happy that this child is waiting a little longer before her profession.
9. I can not enlarge any more, for we are about to leave for Medina. I'm feeling as usual. My companions send you their regards. It wasn't long ago that Anne wrote you the news from here. My best regards to all the Sisters. May God make them saints, and you along with them.
Valladolid, the fifteenth of September.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
10. We are now in Medina and so busy that I cannot say more than that the trip went well. The deferring of Isabel's profession must be done with discretion so that it is not thought that anyone is of higher status, for that is not the main purpose of the delay. 1. Since my confessors commanded me and gave me plenty of leeway to write about the favors and the kind of prayer the Lord has granted me, I wish they would also have allowed me to tell very clearly and minutely",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,1,1,8,0,3,16,1,1,1,10,6,13,10,8,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
"1179",1582,40,"about my great sins and wretched life. This would be a consolation. But they didn't want me to. In fact I was very restricted in those matters. And so I ask, for the love of God, whoever reads this account to bear in mind that my life has been so wretched that I have not found a saint among those who were converted to God in whom I can find comfort. For I note that after the Lord called them, they did not turn back and offend Him. As for me, not only did I turn back and become worse, but it seems I made a study out of resisting the favors His Majesty was granting me. I was like someone who sees that he is obliged to serve more, yet understands that he can't even pay the smallest part of his debt.
2. May God be blessed forever, He who waited for me so long! I beseech Him with all my heart to give me the grace to present with complete clarity and truthfulness this account of my life which my confessors ordered me to write. And I know, too, that even the Lord has for some time wanted me to do this, although I have not dared. May this account render Him glory and praise. And from now on may my confessors knowing me better through this narration help me in my weakness to give the Lord something of the service I owe Him, whom all things praise forever. Amen. 1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. It has not been necessary for me to see you first to value as a very great favor the opportunity you offer me of kissing your hand. For after having learned how well you comprehend all that is good, I myself would have sought to procure the joy of meeting you, if possible. Thus, I beg you to believe that you will be doing me a great favor by coming here to meet me. And if you should come at a time in which we can be together for a longer period, my joy will increase. I had so little time on the feast of St. Thomas that I was happy when you put the visit off for another day.
2. With regard to what you say, it would seem rather to increase one's joy than impede it. There was no time to deal with matters of the soul and all the other things that would",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,7,18,0,4,27,0,1,0,13,3,10,11,10,2,1,1,2,4,2,0
