23. To Saint Catalina, Martyr
 
O great lover
Of God eternal!
Shining star
Protect us!
 
In years so tender
A spouse you took,
So ardent the love,
You knew no rest.
He that is fearful
Away from You should stay.
If life he values
And from death would run.
 
Oh, you cowards, see
This little maid
Who values not gold
Nor her beauty admires.
She embraces the war
And persecution endures
To suffer bravely
With heart truly great.
 
Greater suffering would it be
Without her Spouse to live;
In torments' midst
Rest she found.
Joy comes abounding.
Now she longs to die,
For in living
She cannot live.
 
Those of us seeking
Her joy to possess
Never may we weary,
Seeking our rest.
Oh, mistake deceiving,
Free of all love,
Desiring to be healed
While pain is living.
