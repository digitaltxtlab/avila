1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your paternity, amen. Many persons love you in the Lord for having written such holy and beneficial doctrine, thanking His Majesty for giving it to you for the good of souls -- and I am one of them. And for my part I know that no amount of effort would have prevented me from seeing the one whose words console me so much, if my state in life and my being a woman had allowed it. Unable thus to see you, I had to search out persons like you for assurance against the fears in which my soul lived for some years. And since I have not merited to meet you, I am consoled that Señor Don Teutonio has ordered me to write this letter, something I wouldn't have dared to do on my own. But, trusting in obedience, I hope in our Lord that it will benefit me because you will at times remember to pray for me. I am in great need of prayers since I go about exposed to the eyes of the world and with little to show, nothing to verify in the least what they imagine about me.
2. If you understand these things, it will be enough that you grant me this favor and alms; for knowing so well what the world is, you can comprehend the great trial it is for someone who has lived a wretched life. This being so, I have often dared to ask our Lord to grant you a long life. May it please His Majesty to grant me this favor, and may you continue growing in holiness and in his love, amen.
Your paternity's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
3. Señor Don Teutonio, I believe, is one of those who are deceived in my regard. He tells me he likes you very much. In recompense for this, you are obliged to visit his lordship; don't think it would be fruitless.
