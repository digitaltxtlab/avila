And if something of this attitude is present in one of the nuns, don't consent to having her in the house; she is a Judas among the apostles. Do all you can to free yourselves from such bad company. And if you cannot do this, punish her with more severe penances than you would use for any other fault, until she recognizes that she doesn't deserve to be made from even a very wretched kind of mud. The good Jesus gives you a good Father. Let no one in this house speak about any other father than the one your Spouse has given you.
