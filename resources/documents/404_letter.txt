1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I arrived here in Segovia on the eve of St. Bartholomew feeling well, glory to God, although very tired because the road was bad. So I will stay here six or seven days to rest, and then, if the Lord be served, I will leave for Avila.
2. Since I am coming from such a distance, it wouldn't amount to much for Señor Juan de Ovalle to grant me the favor of giving you and your daughter permission to come to see me, even though there may be some obstacles to this and he would have to stay and watch the house. He could come to see me on another day. Beg him to let you come and let him take this letter as being addressed also to him. Since this messenger has to leave at once, I am not writing him directly. I greatly desire that he grant me this favor, for you can come and stay with Pedro de Ahumada, and I will pay the round-trip traveling expense for the animals. Perhaps I will have to go far away again, and in no manner would I want to do so without seeing you.
3. Because I trust you won't do otherwise, I'll be waiting for you to come some time before the feast of our Lady.
4. My best regards to Señor Don Gonzalo and to Señora Doña Beatriz. May God watch over you all and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen.
Today is 26 August.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
5. Because I hope in God that we will see each other soon, I'll say no more. Give my best regards to Señora Doña Mayor and to whomever else you think it opportune to do so.
