Since Padre Don Luis, superior of the Society of Jesus, came to an agreement with Señor Diego de San Pedro de Palma on what should be given in alms to this house because the latter's daughters have entered here as nuns, I, Teresa of Jesus, a Carmelite nun, and the nuns of this house hereby grant with my signature attached the necessary permission required by the lawyer for the daughters of Señor Diego de San Pedro to renounce their share of their inheritance.
Signed in St. Joseph's in Toledo on the eleventh day in the month of August, 1570.
