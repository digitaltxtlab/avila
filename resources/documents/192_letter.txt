1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence. Yesterday Padre Fray Francisco de la Concepción arrived, who has been staying in Malagón. From the enclosed letter that our padre has written, you will see what a hurry he is in to receive a reply.
2. Juanico came beforehand and told me to expect Padre Fray Francisco who would be coming soon with Mother Prioress from Malagón. She has come to see if the doctors here might be able to cure her illness, for she has improved enough to travel, which is no small thing. A nun from here who is very good went in the meantime to preside at Malagón.
3. It seemed to me that it would not be good to send Fray Francisco to Madrid to wait for a message lest there be too many friars there bothering those blessed men. It's better that he wait here or in Malagón. If you order otherwise, he will go. But it's preferable that you make him stay here and send the message to him here, for this young messenger is trustworthy.
4. Our padre is right. But now I see that you can do no more, and so I wrote to him yesterday that I already knew that it would be almost useless to try to get Methuselah to hurry. Nevertheless, do all that you can, for goodness' sake, and write to me at length.
5. What do you think of the trial Señora Doña Luisa is undergoing? She and her daughter are very distressed. Pray for them, and remain with God, for I am very busy.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
6. My regards to Padre Padilla. The trials, as you know, have caused him so much suffering and left him in so painful a situation that he can be trusted to rise above this other affliction.
