It often happens that the Lord favors a soul that is in a very wretched state. It should be understood that it is not then in mortal sin, in my opinion. God will permit someone who is in mortal sin to see a vision -- even a very good one -- so as to bring that person back to Himself. But I cannot believe that He would place such a person in contemplation. For in that divine union the Lord delights in the soul and the soul in Him. It's incongruous that the purity of heaven would delight in a soul stained with sin or that the delight of the angels would find comfort in what is not His. Now we know that by sinning mortally a soul belongs to the devil; it can delight in him since it has satisfied him, and we already know that his delights are a continual torment even in this life. The Lord will always have devoted sons in whom He can be consoled. He has no need to go about taking those who do not belong to Him, although His Majesty will do what He often does: snatch them from the devil's hands.
