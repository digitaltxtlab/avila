These false accusations, no matter how serious, did not disturb me. But in little things I followed my nature -- and continue to follow it -- without paying attention to what is more perfect. Hence I would like each of you to begin early to understand and reflect upon the much that is gained through all the various ways, and that no one, in my opinion, loses by following any of them. The main thing gained is that in some manner we follow the Lord. I say 'in some manner,' because, as I have mentioned, we are never blamed without our having faults.
