1. I was amused, daughter, at how groundless is your complaining, for you have in your very midst mi padre Fray John of the Cross, a heavenly and divine man. I tell you, daughter, from the time he left and went down there I have not found anyone in all Castile like him, or anyone who communicates so much fervor for walking along the way to heaven. You will not believe the feeling of loneliness that his absence causes me. Realize what a great treasure you have there in that saint. All the nuns in your house should speak and communicate with him on matters concerning their souls, and they will see how beneficial it is. They will find themselves making much progress in all that pertains to spirituality and perfection, for our Lord has given him a special grace in this regard.
2. I declare to you that I would be most happy to have my father Fray John of the Cross here, who truly is the father of my soul and one from whom it benefited most in its conversations with him. Speak with him, my daughters, in total simplicity, for I assure you that you can do so as though you were speaking with me. This will bring you great satisfaction, for he is a very spiritual man with much experience and learning. Those here who were formed by his teaching miss him greatly. Give thanks to God who has ordained that you have him there so close. I am writing to tell him to look after you, and I know from his great charity that he will do so, whatever be your need.
