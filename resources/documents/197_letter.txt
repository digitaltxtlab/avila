For Our Padre Maestro Gracián, Commissary Apostolic and Carmelite Visitator. In Madrid.
1. Jesus be with your paternity. Yesterday I received your letters. With the joy they brought me, I was repaid by the Lord for the pain caused me by the other letters, which were delivered by the same mail carrier who is going to deliver this letter. The nuns at the turn hadn't understood that he would return so quickly, and so there's no time for me to write at length.
2. I don't have time to write to Señora Doña Juana. Please God Señor Gracián's illness is not serious, for I was sorry to hear of it.
3. Today, the octave day of the feast of the Most Blessed Sacrament, Padre Fray Baltasar preached here. He says that in the house where he is residing the other friars are very disturbed about the foundation we are trying to make in Madrid. The matter about the excommunication frightened me.
4. I believe I will have to make use of a private messenger to send you the contracts for your signature, for I think they will be ready today.
5. My brother kisses your hands and asks me to tell you how necessary it is that you carry on very diligently in regard to the lawsuit over the excise. Give money to the procurator to send to the appropriate person so that the process can be concluded quickly and finished before August. This is necessary because of the grave hardship of which I spoke to you.
6. I was extremely pleased that your friend Elías is beginning to understand the reason. You should know that I went to much trouble there so that the prosecutor would understand her and I sent him word to tell you not to go, and I was successful. I don't know whether they gave you the letters. I cannot say more.
Your paternity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
