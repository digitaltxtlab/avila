1. Jesus be with your reverence. Because the messenger is in such a hurry that he finds it difficult to wait for this, I am only going to say that I was annoyed that you would go to the extreme of accepting another blood sister in a community where there are already two. I don't see that it is yet time to transfer one who is already there.
2. You should not in any way give your consent for those two sisters to write to Don Luis what their father says, nor even a word that could be taken for a request; rather you should tell them that in no way will she be received there since there are already two others. And tell them they should ask him not to talk about this, for it will make them very unhappy. And see that nothing different is done. When the next messenger comes I will write again.
3. Tell him that when a monastery is founded in Madrid, you will try to do something, but that for now the charity that was extended to the two is sufficient.
Today is 14 May, for I have no time to write more.
I was delighted to see a letter with your handwriting.
Your Reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
