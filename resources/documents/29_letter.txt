1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and watch over you for me, amen, and repay you for the care you take in giving me gifts. The butter was exquisite, like everything your hands have made for me. Whenever you have some more that is good, I will accept it with pleasure if you remember me, for it is very beneficial to me. The quince were also exquisite; it seems you have no other care than to give me gifts. On my part it is a gift to see a letter from you and know that you are well. As for me, I am not so well right now. I have a pain in my jaw and my face is a little swollen, and that is why this letter is not in my handwriting. But I don't think this will matter at all to you.
2. Pray for me, and don't think it provides me little joy to have a daughter like the one I have had up until now and will have always. I will not forget to pray for you, and the sisters will do the same. All those in this house kiss your hands, especially the subprioress who owes you so much. Pray for her, for her health is not good. May the Lord keep you for me and give you his Holy Spirit.
October, the end of the month.
I beg for the prayers of those ladies, your sisters. May God give health to the one who is ill, for I am beseeching him to do this, and I ask the same for you, my daughter.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
