13. For Christmas
 
Since love
Has given us God
No reason is there to fear,
Let us both die.
 
The Father gives us
His only Son,
Born this day in a stable poor,
To the world He comes.
Oh, great rejoicing,
Now man is God!
No reason is there to fear,
Let us both die.
 
Llorente, look,
With what great love,
The Innocent comes
To suffer in the cold.
He leaves His lordship,
For He is God:
No reason is there to fear,
Let us both die.
 
Pascual, why did He
So graciously take
Garments so coarse
Forsaking such richness?
Let us follow Him,
In seeking poverty;
He became man for this.
Let us both die.
 
For a deed so great
What can we give Him?
Lashes severe
Given so cruelly.
Sorrow so deep
Will be for us!
Should this be true,
Let us both die.
 
Oh, how bold they are
Daring the All Powerful!
He will know death
By an evil people.
Llorente, if this be true,
We must steal Him.
Can you not see He wishes this?
Let us both die.
