1. Jesus be with your honor. I have no longer been sending letters with this messenger, yet I am delighted that he is here so that he can bring this letter from my brother which was given to me while I was at Vespers. Glory to God that he is well, and we can be sure now of his coming as you will see. Please God, Señor Juan de Ovalle is well. Since this messenger's coming was so certain, a few lines could have been sent to let me know how he is. I am fine, and everything is going well, glory to God.
2. It's only right that immediate steps be taken to obtain those documents and take possession. I don't know where that city is of which he speaks, whether it is far away. My brother will certainly know. Since as the saying goes, "Wait no longer than a Creed and a messenger leaves for Madrid," try to act as quickly as possible to track down this lord, who must be involved with litigations, so that the documents will be ready. May the Lord intervene in everything and make you very holy.
3. It seems to me the letter is from a brother-in-law of our uncle Ruy Sánchez's son. I will try to write through this messenger, for he must be reliable; and you, too, write to me.
Today is 9 March.
Regards to my dear children.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
