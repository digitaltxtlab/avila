To my beloved daughters, Sister María de San José and Sister Isabel de la Trinidad, Carmelites.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with you, my daughters. I received your letter and the document. As often as you write me, it will be a consolation for me. It would also be one for me to respond if I didn't have so many things to do, and because of these duties I cannot answer every time.
2. I am delighted that you are now foundresses, for I tell you that certainly if you had not helped in this need, I don't know where I could have found the means to buy a house. Although Señora Catalina de Tolosa desired to buy one, she couldn't do any more than she was already doing. So it was ordained by God that you would be able to do this. Since the archbishop did not want to give the license unless we had our own house and since we didn't have the deposit needed to buy one, see what a troublesome situation we would have been in. With your help, even though the money is not all given at once but just a little, we can buy a good house, with God's help.
3. Praise him very much, my daughters, for you are the source of so great a work; not everyone deserves this grace that he has given to mother and daughters. Don't feel sad about what we have suffered here, for this shows how disturbed the devil is and will serve to bring more prestige to this house. I hope in God that when we have our own house, the archbishop will give the license. Never be disturbed, my daughter, that we suffer, for so much is gained by this.
4. You should know that Elenita de Jesús will make a great nun. She is with us and we are very happy with her. Teresa is better. She sends her best regards and so does Madre Tomasina and all the nuns, and they thank you very much for what you have done, and will pray to God for you.
May His Majesty watch over you for me, amen; and may he make you holy.
Your charity's,
Teresa of Jesus
