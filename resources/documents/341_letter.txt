1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. Having been sick for many days, I put off writing this, although I have a great desire to know how your health is. Glory to God, I am now beginning to get better, although I am weak and my head is in a miserable condition. So, this is not written in my own hand. I beg you to write and tell me about the health of both you and Señora Doña María, whose hands I kiss.
2. You should know that the one hundred ducats have already been paid in Madrid. It made me very happy, as did also the knowledge that our two Romans are well and the business negotiations moving along nicely.
3. Let me know if you have heard anything about our friend, Licentiate Padilla.
4. I don't know where your answer to this might reach me, for I don't think I will be here long. You could send it to Segovia.
5. May our Lord preserve you with the holiness I desire, amen.
Toledo, 6 May.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
