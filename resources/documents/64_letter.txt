1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor, my son. I'm not fortunate enough to have the time to write you at length, but I assure you I have the desire to do so. Your letters bring me happiness in knowing about the favors the Lord grants you, which each day become greater. He is repaying you now for all the work you have done here.
2. You should not tire yourself with a great deal of thinking, nor should you be concerned about meditation. If you haven't forgotten, I have often told you what you should do and how this is a greater favor from the Lord. And to be always praising him and desiring that everyone do so is the greatest effect of the soul's being occupied with His Majesty. May it please the Lord that you, and I as well, may know how to repay something of what we owe him and may he give us much to suffer, even if it comes from fleas, goblins, and traveling.
3. Antoño Sánchez was ready to give us the house without further word, but I don't know what you and Padre Julián de Avila had done with your eyes that you wanted to buy it in the condition that it was in. It's a good thing he had not wanted to sell it. Now we are negotiating to buy one near San Francisco, on the Calle Real in the best part of the suburb, near the market place. It is very nice. Let us pray for this.
4. All the nuns send their best regards. I am better; I was going to say "well," because when I am without the usual ailments, this means good health for me. May the Lord give you health and preserve you for us.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
