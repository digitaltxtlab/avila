I just read again the letter from Paul in which he says he is giving up sleep so as to work on his projects. And I think he says this in reference to his absorption in prayer. He shouldn't get into the habit of abandoning so great a treasure -- tell him this -- unless it involves giving up the sleep that the body needs. For the blessings the Lord gives in prayer are most remarkable, and I am not surprised that the devil would like to take them away. And since this favor cannot be received whenever one wants, it must be prized when God gives it. In a moment His Majesty will present to us better plans for serving him -- apart from so great a gain -- than the intellect could ever search out. And believe me, what I'm saying is the truth -- unless there is question of some important business matter that has to be concluded at the moment -- even if then the sleep does not come because of worries. And if sleep does come, there will be other times for thinking about what the fitting thing to do is. A book I once read says that if we leave God when he wants to be with us, we will not find him when we want to be with him.
