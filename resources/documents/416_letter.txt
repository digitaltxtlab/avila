1. Jesus be with your honor. My capacity for insight is too small for me to have ever imagined yesterday evening that you would say "no" as you did today. You were much more able to sense and dispel the distress of that poor little soul, for she certainly had to go through a painful day, and that wasn't the only one, for she has gone through many. I don't have anything more to say to her mother, but only have to do what you command, for that is what it means to be a subject. And even if it were not what it means, it is so repugnant to my nature to ask someone to do something burdensome that I would act the same way.
2. Now they tell me that Ana de San Pedro has asked Don Alonso to be sure to go and beseech this of you. That was before your note arrived, for I would never in any way have agreed to this after the note. The sermon can be omitted if Father Provincial doesn't come. Clearly, a sermon should not be requested of someone who would not be pleased to comply, but to her parents it will seem a greater loss than spoiling the partridges, and I don't know what they will do. May our Lord make you as holy as I beg of him.
3. I hope this letter reaches you before Don Alonso arrives, for not in the slightest way would I want you to think I am doing anything against your will; what is more, I get very annoyed with this meddling.
Your honor's daughter and servant,
Teresa of Jesus
