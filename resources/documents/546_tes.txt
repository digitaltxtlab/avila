1. I had begun to confess to a person in a city where I am at present. But after his having been very kind to me, ever since he accepted the guidance of my soul, he discontinued coming here. While I was in prayer one night thinking about my need for such a person, I understood that God had kept him from coming because it was fitting for me to discuss my soul with another person in this city.
To do so was a burden to me because I would have to deal with a person I didn't know. It could turn out that he wouldn't understand me and would disturb me, and I loved the first one who had been doing me this charity. Although, whenever I saw or heard this other person preach he brought me spiritual consolation. But it also seemed to me inappropriate because he had many duties. The Lord said to me: "I shall bring it about that he listen to and understand you. Open your soul to him, for some help will come from your troubles." This latter was said, I think, because I was then extremely weary of being separated from God. Then His Majesty also told me He was clearly aware of my trial, but that it couldn't be otherwise while I lived in this exile, that everything was for my greater good; and He consoled me very much.
So it has come about that this other person is happy to listen to me and finds the time and has understood me and given me great comfort. He is a very learned and holy man.
