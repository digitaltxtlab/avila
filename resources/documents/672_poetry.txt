15. The Circumcision
 
He is shedding blood,
Dominguillo, eh!
Why I know not!
 
I ask you why,
Him they condemn,
Innocent He is,
And without evil?
How ardent His desire,
I know not why,
To love me so ardently:
Oh Dominguillo!
 
Then after He was born,
Why did they torment Him?
-- Yes, for He is dying
To cast out evil.
Oh, what a great Shepherd
He will surely be!
Oh Dominguillo!
 
Certainly you have seen
He is but a sinless child?
-- They have told me,
Brasillo and Llorente;
Great will be the loss
Not to love Him
Oh Dominguillo!
