1. Jesus be with your honors. I don't have time to write. I only want to say that I am being very careful about that business matter. I wrote twice to Señora Doña Luisa, and now I am thinking of writing her again. It seems to me she is slow in responding. Certainly I have done and am doing all that I can. May God do what is best for your salvation, for that is what is important. There is no need to send her anything, for I fear that all may be lost. Rather, I am sorry about what you spent to go to Toledo, without any results that I can see. It wouldn't do any harm to send some gift to her brother, for after all he is the master, and nothing would be lost thereby. They are incapable of doing anything unless they think they are gaining something.
2. All gentlemen spend their winters in the country. I don't know why you are troubled about doing the same. Since you -- I mean my sister -- will have the company of Señora Doña Beatriz, to whom I send my best regards, I am not concerned. I am no worse than usual, and that's already good.
3. The nuns have been absolved, although they are still as insistent as before and bear a greater trial, for the discalced friars have been taken away from them. I don't know where it will end up, for it is really distressing to me. Those Fathers are carrying on as though out of their minds.
4. My brothers are well. They don't know about this letter, I mean this messenger, unless they found out from elsewhere. Teresa no longer has a fever, but the head cold continues.
May God be always with your honors.
Today is 10 December,
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
