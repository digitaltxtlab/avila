1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I beg you to tell the one who delivers this letter how you fared last night and if you are very tired. I returned not tired but very happy, and the more I think about the house, the more convinced I am that the other one did not suit us because for our purposes only the courtyard was usable. And if the other little house is sold to us, the nuns will be able to live there well for many years; indeed, very well. I beg you then to try to get this little house. And if it is not for sale, see if they will rent it to us for a few years, since it would be needed by the woman who serves us.
2. You could tell Tamayo that to buy just his house you would have to pay more for it and that we wouldn't be able to pay for the two together except over a period of time. If you agree, it is better that he not know that he displeased us but that he think that at some time in the future we will be able to buy his house. One of the sisters made the witty remark that in Holy Week the two will become friends again and that thus the purchase must be concluded at once.
3. The prioress and sisters kiss your hands for having found them so good a house. They are very happy and are right because everything is very suited to our needs. And it is a great thing for them to see that they will be able to expand by buying more land. It would be great if after Easter we could begin to tear down walls. May the Lord bring this about and watch over your honor as all the nuns beg of him.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
