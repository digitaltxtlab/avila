1. One day after the octave of the feast of the Visitation while I was in a hermitage of our Lady of Mt. Carmel praying to God for one of my brothers, I said to the Lord (I don't know, perhaps I may have just thought it): "Why is my brother in a place where his salvation is in danger? Were I, Lord, to see Your brother in this danger, what wouldn't I do to help him!" It seemed to me that I would have left nothing undone in order to help.
The Lord answered me: "Oh, daughter, daughter! These Sisters in the Incarnation are My Sisters, and you delay? Well, take courage; behold I want it, and it isn't as difficult as it seems to you. And whereas you think some harm will come to your houses, both they and the Incarnation will benefit. Do not resist, for My power is great."
