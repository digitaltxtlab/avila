To my lady and sister Doña Juana de Ahumada.
1. May Jesus be with your honor. I am well, although so busy that I would rather not have to write you now. Blessed be God that Señor Juan de Ovalle is well. By no means should you allow him to come here, for that would be a risk for him. It would have been better had you sent the letters to the Indies by the same way you sent the packages, for the letters you send never reach their destination over there. My greetings to Señora Doña Magdalena, who I was happy to hear is better, and to the children.
2. Fray Diego is here, although I haven't seen much of him. If he can, he will go to visit you. Mother Prioress and my companion are well. As for myself, I am feeling so much better that I would be surprised if it lasted. May the Lord do his will, and may he be with you.
Today is the vigil of St. Augustine. It would be a great mistake for Señor Juan de Ovalle to try to do any traveling.
In the Incarnation ...
Yours truly,
Teresa of Jesus
