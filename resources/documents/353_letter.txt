1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. My grief greatly increased at the thought of what you must be going through. May God be praised who in so many ways grants us favors. Believe, my sister, that suffering is a great favor. Reflect on how everything passes so quickly, as you have seen, and take heart; consider how the gain will be without end.
2. Since Juan de Ovalle is the messenger -- who will tell you what we spoke about -- and because it is almost one o'clock in the morning, I will not be long. If I succeed, Don Francisco will accompany Señor Juan de Ovalle, and if he doesn't go now, I'll try to get him to leave soon. You don't need to recommend that I do all that I possibly can.
3. It is very hard for me now to have to get involved in arranging a marriage after taking care of so many business matters; although I owe all this to the one who is in glory and to having been told that it is for God's service. Beseech him that we might do what is right. I will inform you of what happens here.
4. My best regards to my niece and nephew. I entrust them to God, who is the one able to give them what they deserve, for to trust in creatures is of little worth.
5. May His Majesty be with you and watch over you for me. Give my regards to Mother Prioress and tell her I am well. I have some letters of hers here that I haven't been able to read since I arrived yesterday, for there are so many visitors and business matters to take care of -- and so neither am I able to write to her.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
