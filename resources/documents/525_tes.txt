1. On the vigil of St. Lawrence, just after receiving Communion, my mental faculties were so scattered and distracted I couldn't help myself, and I began to envy those who live in deserts and to think that since they don't hear or see anything they are free of this wandering of the mind. I heard: "You are greatly mistaken, daughter; rather, the temptations of the devil there are stronger; be patient, for as long as you live, a wandering mind cannot be avoided."
2. While I was in this state, there suddenly came upon me a recollection with an interior light so great it seemed I was in another world. And my spirit found within itself a very delightful forest and garden, so delightful it made me recall what is said in the Song of Songs: Veniat dilectus meus in hortum suum. I saw my Eliseus there, certainly not in any way black, but with a strange beauty. On his head was what resembled a garland of precious stones, and many maidens went before him with branches in their hands singing songs of praise to God. I didn't do anything but open my eyes so as to distract myself, and this wasn't enough to take away my attention. It seemed to me there was music from small birds and angels in which the soul rejoiced; although I didn't hear it, but the soul was experiencing that delight. I observed how there was no other man there. I was told; "He deserved to be among you, and this whole festival you see will be had on the day when the feast in praise of my Mother will be established, and hurry if you wish to be where he is."
3. Bringing me great delight, this vision lasted more than an hour and a half, for I couldn't distract myself; it was different from other visions. And what I drew from this was love for Eliseus and a remembrance of him in that beauty. I had feared lest it be a temptation, for it was impossible that it be the work of my imagination.
