Here you see how with these two virtues -- love and fear of God -- you can advance on this road with calm and not think that at every step you see a ditch you could fall into; that way you would never arrive. But since we cannot even know with certitude that we in truth have these two virtues that are necessary, the Lord, taking pity on us because we live in so uncertain a life and among so many temptations and dangers, teaching us to ask -- and asking for us -- says with good reason: But deliver us from evil. Amen.
