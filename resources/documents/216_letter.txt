1. I praise our Lord highly that he is giving you this quiet and the desire to please him in everything, and that he enlightens you at times with such delightful understanding. This is all the work of his great mercy. Well, His Majesty must give the help that matches the trials, and since they are great, so also are the favors. May his name be blessed forever.
2. I tell you, mi padre, that it would be good for you to get your sleep. Realize that you have a great deal of work, and the tiredness is not felt until the head gets into such a condition that there is no remedy, and you already know how important your health is. In this matter follow the opinion of another, out of love of God, and when it is time to sleep set aside your projects, however necessary, and your prayer. Consider doing me this favor. When he sees this fervor of spirit, the devil often presents things as of great importance for God's service so that the good he cannot cut short by one extreme he does by another.
