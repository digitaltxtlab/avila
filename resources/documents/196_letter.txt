For Mother Prioress in Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your reverence, my daughter, and I hope he gave you as joyous a Pentecost as I desired for you. Here we had a happy time with the arrival of our padre, who is on his way to Madrid, having been sent for by the nuncio. He looks healthy and well fed, blessed be God. You should know that it is necessary now to pray much for the affairs of the order and with great n ... and care, for the need is serious.
2. Tostado is already in Madrid. Four or five days ago he passed through here in such haste that he stayed no longer than three or four hours. Please the Lord that in everything he will do what is for God's greater honor and glory, for we desire nothing else. Pray that my head will get better for it is still in bad condition.
3. We have had poor luck with your cloth. They have shown it to half the houses and monasteries in Toledo but have not been able to sell it. Everybody thinks that four reales is too much to ask for it, but our conscience would not allow us to let it go for less. I don't know what we should do about it. Decide what you would like to do. May our Lord be with you.
The last day of Pentecost.
4. Our padre is not here today, for he is preaching at the place where his sister is. He will not be able to write, because the mail carrier is departing.
5. I long to know how you and all the nuns are; some time has gone by since I've received a letter from you. May God watch over you for me. Madre Brianda is very sick and asks for prayers. I beg prayers from all of you and from Fray Gregorio, for now is the time in which we need the prayers of everyone.
6. Send this letter to him right away, and let everyone be on the watch because with the help of the Lord we shall see something good come about, or the opposite will happen. Never was there so much need for prayer. May God keep you.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
