1. I sent a letter last week through the mail carrier from here in which I answered Paul concerning the scapular of the tongues. In speaking about it to Joseph, I was told to inform him that he has many enemies visible and invisible, that he should be careful. For this reason, I would not want him to trust so much in the Egyptians -- you tell him that -- or in the night owls.
