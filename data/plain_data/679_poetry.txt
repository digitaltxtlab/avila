22. To Saint Hilarion
 
Today a warrior has conquered
The world and its defenders.
Return, return, sinners,
Let us follow this path.
 
In solitude let us be
And cease longing for death
Until gaining life
Through poverty sublime.
Oh, great is the skillfulness
Our Warrior has!
Return, return, sinners,
Let us follow this path.
 
With penance as His arms,
Lucifer He vanquished,
In patience He fights,
Nothing frightens Him.
We, too, can conquer
In following this Knight!
Return, return, sinners,
Let us follow this path.
 
Without any defenders,
The cross He embraced
In this our source of unwavering light,
Given to us sinners.
Ah, what blessed love
Our Warrior possessed!
Return, return, sinners,
Let us follow this path.
 
Now the crown he has won,
Suffering has passed,
Rejoicing in His triumph
In glory exalting.
Oh, victory, most fortunate
Won by our Warrior strong!
Return, return, sinners,
Let us follow this path.
