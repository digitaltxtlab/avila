1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Three days ago I received your letter and was truly delighted to know that you are well. May our Lord give you the health I beg of him. You don't need to urge me to do what I am obliged to do for you. Concerning the poor health of Señora Doña María, I have nothing to say, for I know that our Lord seeks to give something good to you and to her with such a continuous trial. Although I have had some trials here, for I have had an unpleasant illness from which I am still not freed, your trial has pained me more.
2. I indeed believe that you rejoice in all the good things that happen to this order; our Lord will reward you as he can. But if you saw the trials that were suffered in this project, the good outcome would make you even happier. Blessed be God who has done this. I kiss the hands of Señora Doña María.
3. I desire a foundation in that place very much, and I am making every effort I can. When our Lord is pleased, things will work out. Until then, there isn't much I can do. The enclosed letters were sent to me from Granada for you. May our Lord watch over you for many years.
From this house of St. Joseph in Burgos, 14 May.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
