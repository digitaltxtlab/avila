1. Once while with this presence of the three Persons that I carry about in my soul, I experienced so much light you couldn't doubt the living and true God was there. In this state He gave me understanding of things I didn't know how to speak of afterward. Among them was how the Person of the Son, and not the others, took flesh. As I say, I wouldn't know how to explain any of these things. For some of them take place so secretly in the soul that it seems the intellect understands as in the case of a person who while sleeping or half asleep thinks that what is spoken is understood within. I was reflecting upon how arduous a life this is that deprives us of being always in that wonderful company, and I said to myself, "Lord, give me some means by which I can put up with this life." He replied: "Think, daughter, of how after it is finished you will not be able to serve me in ways you can now. Eat for Me and sleep for Me, and let everything you do be for Me, as though you no longer lived but I; for this is what St. Paul was speaking of."
