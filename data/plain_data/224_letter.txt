To the very magnificent Señor Antonio de Soria, my lord.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor, amen. I received the one hundred reales and the rest of what the carrier of this letter brought. May the Lord preserve for many years the one who sent them and grant my prayer to give him health.
2. The carrier is bringing the bed, and if Señor Sotomayor is there, I beg you to tell him to examine it to see that no damage was done to it. I was present when it was packed in the cart and saw that the work was done carefully. I am sorry that this is such a lamentable place that I could not find what you asked me for anywhere. They took pains to try to find it -- as this good man will tell you -- and found no more than these three. Please God they will be what you want, for we were unable to make out one part of your letter in which you explain how they should be. Here we call the best kind camlet; any other kind is worthless. Certainly I have been wondering what I could send that you did not already have there, and I don't find anything worthwhile; if I could, it would make me very happy. But it would make me very happy if you informed me of some way I could serve you, without Señor Don Francisco knowing about it.
3. May our Lord ever guide your honor and make you very much his own.
Your servant,
Teresa of Jesus
I am sending seven pieces: two of green damask and five of gold fabric.
