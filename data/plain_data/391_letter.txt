1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. I am tired and it is very late at night, so I will say no more than that the bishop came yesterday; and today arrangements were made for the procession, which was no small thing. It will take place in the afternoon with all the solemnity possible. We will go from here to San Lázaro. The canons will not celebrate the feast tomorrow except to take the Blessed Sacrament from there. I believe we will enter St. Clare's which is along the way. Everything would be nice if mi padre were here. So, I don't know what to say.
2. They also came from Soria this morning for us. But I think they will have to wait until Monday. I am well. The bishop was here all afternoon, showing such eagerness to help this order that it is something to praise God for. May His Majesty be with your reverence.
3. Give my regards to Padre Juan Díaz. All the sisters here send you their best. Padre Nicolao is well, and I the same. He preached a good sermon for us today.
4. I was delighted with Fray Juan de Jesús. The more I observe his love for you, the more I like him. Do not show him any dislike, for a good friend nowadays should be highly esteemed.
Your reverence's servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
Sister Isabel de Jesús is bringing this; in your charity show her much kindness.
