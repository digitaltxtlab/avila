1. After I wrote that letter, I spoke with Canon Salinas. He and Canon Rodríguez think that in order to take possession of the foundation, there would be no house more suitable than the one belonging to the Jesuits and that even by acquiring another house near it the nuns could for many reasons perhaps stay there. And they say that Señora Catalina de Tolosa and you are trying very hard for this because it doesn't matter to those lords, for if it did Padre Maestro Ripalda wouldn't offer it to me. It is very important for us to be granted this favor, even if we have to rent the house, for since you have been living in it for so long, it is not the fault of those fathers. They can think you gave it to us, if the nuns get established; although if we say that we plan to stay there only for a short time no one can complain. They say that once we are there the people in the area will get to know us better.
2. Well what is very important is that both of you in your charity do all you can. If those fathers mind, then I wouldn't want it.
3. If this becomes impossible, they say a house will be looked for in the San Juan quarter ... or at the gate of Santa Gadea. Anyway, it should be where there are people, for it could happen, they say, that after several years it still might not be known that a monastery is there.
4. It also seems that unless the nuns are living in that house where the Most Blessed Sacrament had been reserved, they should not have it reserved at once, and so a platform need not be made, for perhaps when they have their own house, a monstrance can be made. May the Lord direct all for his greater service.
