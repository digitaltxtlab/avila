For Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's Carmel of Seville, Discalced Carmelite Nuns, San José Street, Behind San Francisco.
1. Jesus be with your reverence. I wrote you two days ago by way of the chief courier, and so I have nothing to say here except that my brother is now well (for I forgot to mention this) and that the nuns don't want such expensive fine wool. The material they use for the underskirts here is like what you used for Teresa, although coarser, the coarser the better. For goodness' sake, take care to send me news of our padre by the means I pointed out in the letter his paternity brought you. I'm longing to know whether he arrived safely and how his trip went. If I was so concerned when he was close, imagine what I feel now!
2. My great desire is that you be careful not to fill the house with nuns unless someone comes along who is suited for the life and able to help pay for the house. I also desire that you reach an agreement about the excise. I assure you that your troubles are of concern to me. Please God, I may see you without any and with the health I desire for you. My regards to all the sisters, and to my nurse, whom I don't forget, especially at night.
3. I am not going to write again to our padre now, for as I say I wrote him at length the day before yesterday, and I think he will be so busy that it will be good not to bother him with unnecessary matters. I pray hard for him. Don't fail to do so there. And give my very best regards to Padre Fray Gregorio. You haven't mentioned whether his health is all right now.
Yesterday was the feast of St. Matthew.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
We are well.
