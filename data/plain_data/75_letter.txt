To the Magnificent Señor Antonio Gaytán, my lord.
1. Jesus be with your honor and repay you for the book you sent, which is just right for me. I would need more time to answer your question -- I mean about what touches on prayer -- although the substance of the answer is that this is a very common way of proceeding by those who have reached contemplation. I have often told you this, but you forget it. You have to realize that just as there are different seasons on this earth, so there are in the interior life, and it cannot be otherwise. So don't be troubled -- you are not at fault.
2. As for the rest, I cannot be a judge, since I am an interested party; and also my natural inclination has always been toward the state of solitude, although I have not merited to have it, and since this is the state proper to our order, I could be giving counsel appropriate for myself but not for what is fitting for you. Speak about this clearly with Father Rector, and he will see what is best; and try observing to which one your spirit has the greater leaning. May God keep you, for I am writing so many letters that I don't know how I have been able to say this much, and the messenger is waiting.
3. As to my departure, there is nothing new; I don't know how it could be possible this year. God can do all. Pray much to His Majesty for me, as I do for you, and keep me always informed about yourself.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
