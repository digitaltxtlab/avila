1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your most illustrious lordship. I received two letters from you, a favor that was for me a great consolation. I kiss your hands many times. I have already obeyed the orders you gave me in them to give the habit to our dear sister Elena de Jesús. As you will see from the enclosed letter, I hope in the Lord that she will bring much glory to our Lord and good to this holy order of his glorious Mother and that she will serve you more through her prayers; the more she grows in holiness, the more pleasing they will be to God.
2. I give great thanks to His Majesty in learning that you are in good health. May he be pleased that this continue for many years, a petition that all of these subjects of yours make to him. I have confidence that through these prayers he will grant us this favor, for I know that these are good souls praying for you. Since I am so wretched, I have little trust in my own prayers, although I keep you truly present, especially each day when I am in his presence.
3. Our Father Provincial went to give the habit and wrote to me of the great happiness this brought him.
From this house of St. Joseph's in Avila, 30 October.
Your most illustrious lordship's subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus
