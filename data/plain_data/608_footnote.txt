With regard to the unfortunate ones who will be condemned, who will not enjoy Him in the next life, He did all He could for their profit and to be with them on 'this day' of this life to strengthen them. If they let themselves be conquered, it will not be His fault. And so as to win consent from the Father, He reminds Him that it will be for only a day.
