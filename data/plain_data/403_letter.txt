1. I am delighted that things in Andalusia have gone so well, although it will still be necessary that you make the visitations there this winter when the pestilence is completely gone. I am delighted to know that according to what Casademonte writes me it is already gone.
2. You wouldn't believe how much I desire to send you a lot of money, because you have so little, and truly everyone should come to the help of that house because it will be so beneficial for the order. I have been devising different schemes; I don't know what I'll come up with. I don't think it will be much.
3. It's very hot here. Be careful not to get absorbed in overseeing the work, because the sun is now beginning to burn ...
4. Today is the feast of our Father St. Albert. A Dominican friar preached and spoke a great deal about him.
Your reverence's servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
