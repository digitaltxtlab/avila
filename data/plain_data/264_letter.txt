For love of our Lord I beg you, daughter, to suffer and be silent and not try to send that padre away from there, no matter how many trials and troubles he causes, unless something amounts to an offense against God. I cannot bear our seeming to be ungrateful to someone who has helped us. For I remember that when others wanted to deceive us about a house they were selling, he alerted us to their deceit. I can never forget the good he did us in that instance and the trouble he saved us from. And he has always seemed to me to be a servant of God and well intentioned. I see clearly that this need in me to show gratitude is not a sign of perfection. It must be a natural trait, for I could be bribed with a sardine.
