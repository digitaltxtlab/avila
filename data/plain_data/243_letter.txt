1. By the power that I have from Father Apostolic Visitator, Maestro Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios, I give permission to Mother Prioress, Ana de San Alberto, to grant profession to Sisters Florencia de los Angeles and Inés de San Alberto and Francisca de la Madre de Dios; and I give them permission to make it.
2. May it please the Lord that this be for his glory and honor and that he give them all that is fitting for daughters of the Blessed Virgin, our Lady and Patroness, amen.
Dated in St. Joseph's in Avila on the 30th day of April in the year 1578.
