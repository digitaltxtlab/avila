1. Once after receiving Communion I was given understanding of how the Father receives within our soul the most holy Body of Christ, and of how I know and have seen that these divine Persons are present, and of how pleasing to the Father this offering of His Son is, because He delights and rejoices with Him here -- let us say -- on earth. For His humanity is not present with us in the soul, but His divinity is. Thus the humanity is so welcome and pleasing to the Father and bestows on us so many favors. I understood that He also receives this sacrifice from the priest who is in sin, except that He doesn't grant to his soul the favors He grants to those who are in the state of grace. But the reason for this isn't because these influences proceeding from this communication, by which the Father receives this sacrifice, lose their force, but because of a lack on the part of the one receiving it; just as the lack is not on the part of the sun when it fails to shine on a piece of pitch as it does on crystal, but on the part of the pitch. If I could now describe this, I would give a better explanation. It is important to know the nature of this communication, for there are deep interior secrets revealed when one receives Communion. It is a pity that these bodies of ours do not let us enjoy them.
