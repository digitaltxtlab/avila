1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, amen. I want you to know that yesterday the bishop sent us twelve bushels of wheat. Since the alms are being given in your name, it is good that you know about it in case you might see it. I beg you to let me know how you are getting along on such humid days and if you have gone to confession for the feast of this glorious saint. He is a very great saint, and it is right that you be devoted to him, since you are so kind to the poor.
2. Señora Doña María has sent me word that she will not be satisfied about the reliquary until you give it to me. She speaks of it as though it were her own. It also seems to me that you have a right to it. Since it is the Lord who will repay you for this favor and all the favors you do for us, he will understand this proceeding and render a fair judgment.
3. May His Majesty preserve and guide you for many years. Mother Prioress and the sisters here ask for your prayers.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
