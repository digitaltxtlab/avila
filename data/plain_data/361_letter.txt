1. Jesus. After having written a letter, which your reverence will receive, Padre García Manrique sent me this one. Do not delay or be afraid to do what he asks for here, but go ahead and do so. When, surprised by your new decision, I wrote the letter, I thought that Pedro de la Banda had asked you for some documents and that Padre García Manrique had not been informed, and that is why I asked you to inform me if there is anything else. But I don't see any drawback to doing what he asks here; neither does Madre Inés de Jesús see any reason for your not doing so at once, nor does the prioress. So I beg you, for goodness' sake, to do so. And even if there is some drawback, it is enough that the agreement has at last been reached. Because it didn't seem so nice to us when they didn't keep their word -- the gentleman from Salamanca -- we wouldn't want to be imitating them.
2. Because I have gone on at greater length in the letter I mentioned, I'm saying no more than that may God give you a great love for him.
Your reverence's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
