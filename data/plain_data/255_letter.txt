I think this is the day he must speak to the king, for he arrived at the Escorial yesterday. Watch carefully that if he is placed under the authority of the nuncio his safety will be guaranteed. For I see that many things are being done that have no legal backing. It's necessary to insist on the matter of our becoming a province ... brother, I beg you to place the enclosed in his very hands.
