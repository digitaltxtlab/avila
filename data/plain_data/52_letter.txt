To His Sacred, Catholic, Imperial Royal Majesty, the Lord King.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your majesty, amen. I truly believe that your majesty is aware of the everyday care I take to recommend you to our Lord in my poor prayers. Since I am so miserable a person, this may be of small service, but by stirring the sisters of these discalced monasteries of our order to do so, I may be of some help to you; for I know that they serve our Lord. And in this house where I now reside, the same is done, together with praying for our lady the queen and for the prince -- may God give him long life. And the day in which his highness was pronounced heir, special prayers were offered. This we will do always. Thus, the more this order increases, the more your majesty will gain.
2. As a result, I dare to beg your majesty for your favor in certain matters about which the licentiate Juan de Padilla, in whom I'm confiding, will speak to you. Would you give credence to him. Seeing his true zeal, I felt confident in entrusting this affair to him. If it were made public, great harm would be done to what we are aiming after, which is all for the glory and honor of our Lord. May His Divine Majesty preserve you for many years, as many as are needed by Christendom. It is a great relief that in its trials and persecutions, our Lord God has as great a defender and help for his Church as is your majesty.
From this house of the Incarnation in Avila, 11 June 1573.
Your majesty's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
