For Mother Prioress of St. Joseph's, Seville.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your reverence, my daughter. I wrote at length to our padre and so I have nothing more to say except that I desire news about you and that the prioress of Malagón is a bit better.
2. My brother wants to know if you received his letters, one of which contained four reales to be given to the pharmacist who lives near your house. They are for some ointment my brother received from him when, I think, he had the sore leg. If they didn't arrive, pay for this yourself and don't neglect to write to him, for I think he expects this even though I send him your greetings. My best regards to all the nuns; the prioress sends her regards to you. She will write through the muleteer. I didn't permit her to do so now hoping to pay less postage. More letters have arrived than I expected, and so the cost for postage will be high.
3. I would like to have news about mi padre, about the prior of Las Cuevas, and about what has been done in regard to the water. May God in his power provide and watch over all the sisters for me; give them my regards. For goodness' sake remember to tell our padre to be careful, and to show him every attention; and add what you spend to the forty ducats and don't be foolish. Do what I'm telling you, and also pay the postage, for I will verify it here. I am asking all the nuns to pray hard for you, although I see there is no need to do so.
Today is the vigil of St. Matthew, and I am yours,
Teresa of Jesus
