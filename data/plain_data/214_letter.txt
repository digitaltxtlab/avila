1. I take it as a very great favor from God that in the midst of so many storms Paul has the strength to make such great decisions. Just one hour of these troubles a month would be too much, for they present so many occasions for taking away one's peace. Glory be to the One who gives it.
2. If you carry out that promise, I will need nothing more for my consolation, for all other trials will finally come to an end. And if they did not, it would matter little. Tell him that I must keep that written document so as to remind him of its words should he not have it.
3. His willingness came just at the right time because of the fears I experience. My great anxiety is that Paul might stray in some way from the will of God. In this regard Joseph has greatly reassured Angela that he is doing well and continuing to merit more and more.
