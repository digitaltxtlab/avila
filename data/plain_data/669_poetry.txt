12. At the Birth of Jesus
 
Giles, today there comes to redeem us
A shepherd boy, our kinsman,
God Omnipotent!
 
He frees us from
Satan's prison;
But He is kin of Bras,
Menga, and Llorente,
Oh, He is God Omnipotent!
 
If He be God, why sold
And crucified dies?
Giles, in His suffering innocently,
Do you see, He vanquished sin?
He is God Omnipotent.
 
Oh, I saw Him being born
Of a shepherdess most fair.
If he is God, why did He desire
Among such poor folks to be?
See you not that He is Omnipotent?
 
No more questioning,
Let us serve Him.
Llorente, since He comes to die,
Let us die with Him.
He is God Omnipotent.
