1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and may he give you on this feast a great plenitude of his love, as I beg of him. May he repay you for what you give me with your letters, which is very great; and which is so with the most recent one. It would make me very happy, since you are in Madrid, if God were to ordain the establishment of that foundation because I would also then be able to communicate with you more and be near his most illustrious lordship. I was delighted that you did not stay long enough in Toledo for the heat to arrive, and I praise our Lord for the good health he gives his lordship. May God be pleased to preserve him for many years; when founding a house, we begin to pray for such an intention.
2. The foundation here has now been completed, glory to God. I have always had poor health in this place. Nonetheless, I wouldn't want to leave except to go to Madrid. This is what I wrote to his lordship. And afterward, please God, I want to do no more traveling, for I am very old and tired.
3. Here some are saying that the king already wants to go there; others say he will not go there so soon. Regarding the foundation, it seems it would be more fitting that it be already made when he arrives, if the cardinal were to give his consent. I trust that His Majesty will enlighten him about the best thing to do and that he might want to grant me a favor. Yet I would not want to be a bother. But, since his illustrious lordship has so many things to do, and I know this to be for the service of our Lord, I would not want it to be neglected because of a lack of effort on my part. And so I am reminding him, feeling very certain that God will give him the light to do what is best and at the best time.
May His Majesty watch over you, as I beg of him, amen.
From this house of St. Joseph in Burgos, on the second day of this feast of the Holy Spirit.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
