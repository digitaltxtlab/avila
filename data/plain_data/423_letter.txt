1. Jesus. Padre Fray Ambrosio is bringing the eight escudos that Antonio Ruiz gave me to send to you. I obtained two with the help of good reasons; I couldn't get any more. It seems I am learning how to be a beggar -- something really new for me -- and I don't feel the least bit embarrassed. It's true that since the money belongs to the order, I don't get troubled. May our Lord make you very holy, as I beg of him, amen.
2. Give my best regards to Mother Prioress. If those fathers are so cold in the house they are buying, what must the nuns be undergoing? Their faith will save them, for I certainly have little faith as regards that house.
It is the first of December.
3. Let me know how your feet are. You must be having really cold weather if you are now getting chill blains, for nothing else causes them. I am doing fairly well, although tired.
4. All the nuns recommend themselves to your prayers, especially Teresa, who is very happy with her diurnal; and the other nuns are happy with their books.
Your reverence's servant, subject, and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
For our Father Fray Jerónimo Gracián de la Madre de Dios, provincial of the discalced Carmelites, mi padre, Salamanca.
