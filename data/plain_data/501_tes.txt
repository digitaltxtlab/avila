1. A few days after the experiences mentioned above, while thinking about whether they who thought it was wrong for me to go out to found monasteries might be right, and thinking that I would do better to be always occupied in prayer, I heard the words: "While one is alive, progress doesn't come from trying to enjoy Me more but by trying to do My will."
I thought that their recommendation would be God's will because of what St. Paul said about the enclosure of women, of which I was recently told and had even heard before. The Lord said to me: "Tell them they shouldn't follow just one part of Scripture but that they should look at other parts, and ask them if they can by chance tie my hands."
