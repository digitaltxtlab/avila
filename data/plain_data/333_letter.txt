1. Jesus be with your paternity. You should know that today Padre Fray Ambrosio, prior of Almodóvar, has come and is hoping to speak to Fray Gabriel, who will be the one to come for us. Certainly, mi padre, he has seemed to me to be an upright and intelligent man. I do not say this because I spoke openly with him about anything small or great; rather I proceeded with great caution in everything, with a yes or a no. But I say I am delighted to know that these factions -- if there ever were any -- thought to be still in existence, have broken apart. Regarding Fray John of the Cross I can swear that nothing of the sort ever entered his mind, rather he helped the friars in Rome as much as he could, and he would die, if necessary, for you. This is the absolute truth.
2. This Fray Ambrosio has great zeal for the good of the order, and so I don't think he will do anything he shouldn't. He comes from Seville and has seen what is going on there, and Padre Nicolao had no small thing to put up with from those people ...
3. I found my Isabel getting a little chubby, and her color was something to praise God for. Those who are in Madrid are also well, and your sister Señora Doña Juana, too, as I recently learned.
4. Don't neglect to send me the permission for Antonio Gaytán's daughter.
5. Of course, I am annoyed at Padre Mariano for not sending me the documents you sent for me; may God pardon him.
6. The prioress and all the nuns recommend themselves to your prayers ...
7. May the Lord watch over you, and for your goodness toward us give you what most befits you as well as an abundance of grace in the midst of so much turmoil, amen.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
