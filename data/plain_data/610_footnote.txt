I don't say that you shouldn't recite vocal prayers (don't take me literally and say that I am dealing with contemplation -- unless the Lord places you in it), but that if you recite the Our Father you should understand how truly you are present with Him who taught it to you, kiss His feet in gratitude for it, and beg Him not to leave you.
