1. ... it seems the arrival of the king has been delayed, and I beg you to give the cardinal an account for me of how well this foundation has been made, even though the archbishop held off from giving the permission. In sum, settle the matter there according to what you think. If Señora Doña Luisa is not there, write to her for me, for I don't have time to do so now. I felt her trials deeply.
2. May God give you the quiet rest that I desire for you. To be sure, you are an old friend who cannot bear to see me with sufferings; you indeed owe me this.
Today is the feast of St. George. Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
My best regards to Madre Brianda de San José ...
