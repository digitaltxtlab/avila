10. On the Way to Heaven
 
Toward heaven let us journey,
Nuns of Carmel.
 
Mortified, humble, and despised,
Let us walk,
Consolations left aside,
Nuns of Carmel.
 
Unresisting let us go
To vowed obedience,
Our consoling aim,
Nuns of Carmel.
 
Poverty is the way,
The very road He came,
Our heavenly Emperor,
Nuns of Carmel.
 
Untiring in loving,
Our God is calling;
Trusting Him, let us follow,
Nuns of Carmel.
 
Afire in love's burning,
He, once born trembling,
Veiled in our humanity,
Nuns of Carmel.
 
Hasten to this enrichment
Where poverty and grief
Will never be,
Nuns of Carmel.
 
Elijah, our Father, leads,
In our self-denying we follow him
Strongly and zealously,
Nuns of Carmel.
 
Renouncing our will,
We long to attain
Elisha's double spirit,
Nuns of Carmel.
