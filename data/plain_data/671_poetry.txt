14. At the Birth of the Infant God
 
My Gallejo, look who is coming.
Angels they are, the dawn is nigh.
 
My ears are ringing
With what seems an old song
Look, Bras, daylight is here.
Let us go to the shepherdess.
My Gallejo, look who is coming.
Angels they are, the dawn is nigh.
 
Is she a relative of the Mayor,
Or who is this maiden?
God the Father's daughter,
Glowing starlike.
My Gallejo, look who is coming.
Angels they are, the dawn is nigh.
