In writing this I have felt the desire to know why, after the Lord said 'daily,' He then repeated by saying 'this day.' I want to tell you of my foolish reflections. If they are foolish, so be it because it is foolish enough of me to get involved in this explanation. But since we are learning about what we are asking for, let us think carefully about what it is so that, as I have said, we may appreciate its value and be thankful to Him who with so much care is teaching us.
