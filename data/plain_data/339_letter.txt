1. Jesus be with your reverence. Yesterday I wrote to you and afterward the occasion arose to send some letters to Father Vicar. You being so poor, it isn't right to make you pay so much postage, but this cannot be helped.
2. In your charity, please send this letter to my brother along with the one addressed to him so that he will know that Padre Nicolao, having arrived late today, is now here. I immediately asked him about the money for my brother. He tells me that he will leave me authorization so that the prioress here may withdraw the money from the amount they will be sending and send it to you. He tells me that the one who has the money has assured him that he will give it to him at once. So from what I understand it will be collected soon. The money from Valladolid, it seems, was sent to Seville for some business transactions and will be recovered; if not it will be paid back in some other way; that is certain.
3. Give my regards to María de San Jerónimo -- tell me how she is -- to Isabel de San Pablo, to Teresa, and all the others; may God make them all saints. May he be with you.
4. In any case try to send me the answers from Father Vicar and my brother, as I have already mentioned to you in other letters. If Father Vicar is gone, let me know where; and the letters for him return to me.
Today is 16 April.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
