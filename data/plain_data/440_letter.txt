1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Since you left Spain, I have been so busy and in such poor health that I can be excused for not having written before. But I did not fail to share in your joy over the brother-in-law given you by the Lord. Señora Doña María wrote to me about it and also begged me to pray to God for some business matters of yours since it doesn't seem that you are lacking trials. May he be praised for everything.
2. These sisters and I have prayed for this intention and would like to know if the tempest has passed. I always have and will have care about such request for prayers, however wretched I am, since I am obliged to have it. I don't consider it bad that in the midst of so much prosperity from God you experience some adversity, since this is the path along which he has led all his chosen ones. Now it seems we are at peace here, as you will learn from Padre Nicolao de Jesús María since he is the one bringing this. And since you will also learn from him everything that I could say here, I won't go on with any more. May our Lord watch over you and help you progress in his service.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
3. I hadn't heard anything about the good Bishop of the Canaries until a little before he embarked. He was well.
