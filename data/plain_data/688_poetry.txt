31. Against an Impertinent Little Flock
 
Now that you give us clothing new,
Heavenly King,
From all nasty creatures
Free this cloth of wool.
 
St. Teresa:
Daughters, since you have taken the cross,
Take courage.
Ask a favor
Of Jesus, your light.
Your defender he will be
In such peril.
 
All:
From all nasty creatures
Free this cloth of wool.
 
St. Teresa:
These nasty creatures
The prayer disturbs
Of the spirit
In devotion weak;
Yet strongly kept
Is that heart in God.
 
All:
From all nasty creatures
Free this cloth of wool.
 
St. Teresa:
Since you came here to die,
Do not become confused;
And of such evil creatures
You will have no fear.
In God is found
Your remedy for this evil.
 
All:
Now that you give us clothing new,
Heavenly King,
From all nasty creatures
Free this cloth of wool.
