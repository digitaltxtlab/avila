It is all explained well in the book I mentioned I wrote, and thus there is no reason to deal with it here in any particular way. There, I said everything I knew. If God brings any among you to this state of contemplation -- for, as I said, some of you are in it -- you should strive to obtain that book after I die; it will mean a lot to you. Those of you who are not in this state will have no reason to do anything but struggle to carry out what is mentioned in this book I'm writing now, to make progress in as many ways as you can, and to use diligence; for the Lord will grant you the ability to do these things if you beg Him for it and adopt the proper measures. As for the rest, the Lord Himself will give it and not deny it to anyone who reaches the end of the journey by fighting as has been said.
