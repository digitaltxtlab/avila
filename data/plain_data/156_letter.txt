1. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor and give you the comfort that is necessary for what seems to us at this moment in time to be so great a loss. But the Lord who has willed this and loves us more than we do ourselves will make us understand in due time that he has brought about the greatest good possible for my cousin and for all of us who wish her well, for he always calls souls to himself when they are in the best condition to respond.
2. You ought not think of having a long life, for everything that finishes so quickly is short. But consider that your loneliness may not last long and entrust yourself completely into God's hands, for His Majesty will do what is most fitting. It is a great consolation to see a death that allows us to have such assurance that she will live forever. And have the belief that if the Lord now takes her to himself, it is so that you and your daughters will have more help since she is in the presence of God.
3. May His Majesty hear us, for we have prayed much for her, and enable you to be resigned to whatever he does and give you the light to understand how short-lived the enjoyments and troubles of this life are.
4. I'm sending two melons that I've found, but they're not as good as I would like them to be.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
