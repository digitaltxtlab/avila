1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, amen. I tell you that you are a real source of mortification. Do you think that because I am far away I have stopped both knowing what you are doing and feeling displeased about it? No, certainly not; rather it distresses me even more. For I am aware of the great consolation that those sisters receive from the kindness you show them and how consoled they are when they can go to confession to you. And so the prioress in writing to me is very distressed, and she is right.
2. For even though Father Provincial is there now and consoles them, not everyone will always be pleased to confess with just one. Nor should you worry about your happy spirit. I regret that I wasn't there at a time when I could have enjoyed your kind ways; I urgently entrust myself to your prayers. If Father Provincial approves, it is enough that I be a relative of yours for me to give you my highest approval, how much more so because of your other qualities.
3. Since I hear about you from the prioress, and you hear about me, and on account of my many duties -- it was restful for me there compared to what goes on here -- I do not write more often. But I will not forget you in my poor prayers, so I beg you to remember me in yours ...
