1. The relics of the young shepherd saints that were brought to Alcalá moves us to praise our Lord. May he be blessed for everything. Indeed, sir, it is so easy for His Majesty to make saints that I don't know why you are so amazed up there that he should grant some favors to those who live in solitude. May it please the Lord that we know how to serve him, for he knows so well how to repay.
2. I was most happy that you were pleased ... which will not be enjoyed save by one who truly understands how sweet the Lord is. May it please God to preserve you for me many years as a help to those sisters.
3. Do not allow them to speak with one another about the kind of prayer they experience, nor should they get involved in such matters, or speak about Concepción, for each one will want to add some foolishness of her own. They should let her be, for when she cannot do all the work, they can find another and the two can share the work, for God will provide food ...
4. Your mother and sister must remember little of me. I will write to the abbess,if I can. May God give her health. I already wrote to Madrid for the coarse wool. I don't know whether I am forgetting something. At least, I won't forget to pray for you. Please do the same for me and ask the Lord that this new house for his service may be founded. Next Tuesday, I think, we will be going for certain. Today is the vigil of Our Lady of the Incarnation. My regards to Padre Lárez, Brother Cristóbal, and to Maridíaz.
Your unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
