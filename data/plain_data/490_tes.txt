1. On November seventeenth, during the octave of St. Martin, in the year 1569, I saw with regard to what I know that twelve years had gone by out of the thirty-three, which is the number of years the Lord lived; so twenty-one still remained.
This happened in Toledo, in the monastery of the glorious St. Joseph of Carmel.
I for you and you for me.
Life.
Twelve were lived for me and not for my will.
