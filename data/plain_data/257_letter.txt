You will not believe, daughter, the pain I suffer because of the disappearance of mi padre Fray John of the Cross. We find no trace of him and have no light as to his whereabouts. These calced fathers are making every effort to put an end to this reform. For the love of God I beg you, since you and my daughter Catalina de Jesús commune so familiarly with our good Jesus, to beg him to favor and help us. For this intention recite the litany in choir for fifteen days. And during these days, in addition to the hours of prayer you have, add another hour. And inform me, daughter, of how you are implementing this.
