Jesus. Memo of what must be done in Caravaca.
1. When your reverence arrives, set up the enclosure in your house and let no one enter. While waiting for the grilles to be put up, speak with outsiders in the place where the grilles will be erected, or at the turn, and try to have the grille put up at once.
2. It is necessary before Mass is said -- I mean before taking possession of the house -- to put up a bell and have a lawyer look at the contract in which these ladies agree to provide an income for the monastery. And show him the certified patent that you have from our most Reverend Father in virtue of which, in addition to the power of attorney given you by me, you may accept the monastery without any onus or financial obligation or anything else, for that is how it is given in the contract.
3. When the contract is agreed on -- and Padre Ambrosio will watch that everything is done correctly -- and you and those ladies have signed it, the Blessed Sacrament may be reserved.
4. Note that the license given by the king must also be noted in the contract, for I don't believe it is necessary to have a license from the bishop. The bell must be rung at Mass in order to take possession of the house. It isn't necessary to bless the church, since it isn't properly speaking a church. Once possession of the house has been taken, those ladies will be able to receive the habit whenever they so desire.
