1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor.
I have not forgotten the image of our Lady that you have offered me as a gift, which must be very beautiful since Señor Albornoz is pleased with it. So I beg you to give it to whomever Padre Maestro Gracián sends for it, for his reverence will take care of sending it to me.
2. I will take care of asking our Lady to keep you close to her, and Señor Albornoz as well. Since I am so far away, I don't know whether you did anything more regarding the matter you wrote to me about in Valladolid. My health is good, glory to God, and I'm faring well in this region where obedience has brought me. I desire very much that you will have good health and always advance along the path that you have begun in the service of our Lord.
3. May it please His Majesty that you make good progress and may he always rescue your honor from the tumult of Madrid, although nothing disturbs the one who truly loves God.
Today is 19 June. From this house of the glorious St. Joseph in Seville.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
