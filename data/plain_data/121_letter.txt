To our Padre Fray Jerónimo Gracián, apostolic commissary of the Carmelite Order.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit guide and enlighten your honor, and may your Blessed Virgin accompany you.
I tell you, I believe you should make use of the least culpable among those friars to execute your orders. If that provincial had not carried on so foolishly, he would not have been a bad executioner. I am much more encouraged now than I was that other time.
2. You should know that my good friend Salazar is here. Hardly had I written that I needed to see him than he circled back many leagues so as to come here. He is indeed a friend. I was delighted with his visit. He says that the chief angel is very happy to have a niece among the butterflies and that he esteems them highly, and Salazar told him about the eagles and never stops praising them.
3. The prioress and sisters here send you many greetings. They are praying urgently for your paternity. My Isabel is doing very nicely. The enclosed letter is from Señora Doña Juana. She will be my consolation, although it's a terrible embarrassment for me that this house cannot be set up to provide for her adequately. How come you didn't inform that man Roque about my letters? Now I see that that is the name I wanted to know. Pardon the length of this; it was a way of relaxing. And God be with you.
Yesterday was our Lady's feast. Antonio arrived today.
Your unworthy daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
4. Rodrigo Alvarez has written to me and said much about you. Don't neglect to keep in touch with them as usual, for charity's sake.
