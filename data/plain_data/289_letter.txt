1. I am shocked and saddened by those two souls; God help them. It only seems that all the furies of hell have joined together there to deceive and blind persons both within the community and outside.
2. Your paternity should know that all the terrible distress I experienced when you wrote me about the process going on there resulted from my having foreseen what is now happening, that they would raise some calumny against Paul. And this miserable vicaress has always been known for spreading some serious calumnies. For days I have been living with this affliction. O Jesus, how it has weighed down on me! All the trials we have suffered were nothing in comparison.
3. God is indeed teaching us what little attention we ought to pay to creatures, however good they may be, and how we need to be shrewd instead of so simple, and, please God, that will be enough for Paul and for me.
