3. On Those Words "Dilectus Meus Mihi"
 
Myself surrendered and given,
The exchange is this:
My Beloved is for me,
And I am for my Beloved.
 
When the Gentle hunter
Wounded and subdued me,
In love's arms,
My soul fallen;
New life receiving,
Thus did I exchange
My Beloved is for me,
And I am for my Beloved.
 
The arrow he drew
Full of love,
My soul was oned
With her Creator.
Other love I want not,
Surrendered now to my God,
That my Beloved is for me,
And I am for my Beloved.
