1. Jesus be with your charity, my daughter, and may he watch over you and give you the health I desire for you, for it has greatly grieved me that you are not well. Do me the charity of pampering yourself. And what they tell me in these parts about what the Sisters are doing with you delights me very much, for if they didn't behave this way, they would be acting badly. You should be as happy with the comforts as you are without them, for obedience will consider whether you need them or not, and in fact that's what it's doing. Please God, my daughter, that the illness will not get worse. Let me know, when you have a messenger, if you are better, for I am worried.
2. What I said to you in the other letter, I would like to say often, if I could see you. But this won't take place so soon, for the cardinal has written me promising to give me the permission when the king returns, and they are already saying that he is coming. But however soon, it won't be until September or later. Don't be sad about this, for I would be as happy to see you as you me. Since this cannot happen now, God will arrange it in another way. I am in such poor health that I am in no condition to travel either down there or anywhere else, although I am better than I was some days ago. May God be praised.
3. I took some pills, and so I didn't write this letter myself, for I don't dare.
May God give you an abundance of grace, my daughter, and do not forget me in your prayers.
It is 6 July.
Your charity's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
