1. May the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre, and give you strength to undergo this battle, for nowadays there are few whom the Lord allows the devils and the world to attack so furiously.
2. May his name be blessed, for he has willed that you gain so many merits all together. I tell you that if our nature were not so sensitive, reason would make us well understand the great motive we have for rejoicing. I am relieved to know that you do not fear excommunication, although I never thought that you could be excommunicated ...
3. May God watch over you and allow me to see you one day at a calm moment, if only for us to encourage each other so as to return to suffering. All the nuns send their best regards.
4. Please God you will respond to everything, for you have become very Biscayan. I know that there are reasons, but since this brings me so much suffering none of them suffices.
