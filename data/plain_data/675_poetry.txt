18. To the Cross
 
O Cross, my life's delightful rest,
My welcome be.
 
Beneath your protecting banner
Even the weakest are made strong!
O life of our death,
Reviving it so well.
Having tamed the lion,
By you he was slain:
My welcome be.
 
Captive is he that loves you not,
No freedom does he know;
Those who approach you
From bad paths are saved.
Oh, in this Kingdom blessed
Evil finds no rest:
My welcome be.
 
You are the freedom
From our dread captivity;
With so precious remedy,
From evilness You restored me.
In God the means
Of this joy obtained:
My welcome be.
