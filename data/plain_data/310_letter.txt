1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I received your letter; also, the chaplain who brought it came to speak with me. May the Lord reward you for the favor you always show me. I feel your trials so deeply that if by this I could provide a remedy, your trials would be over. But since I am so wretched, I merit little before our Lord. May he be praised for everything. For since he permits this, it will serve to bring you greater glory. Oh, my lady, how deep are the judgments of this great God of ours! The time will come when you will prize your troubles more than all the repose you have had in this life. Now the present trial is painful to us, but if we think of the path His Majesty took in this life, and all those who we know rejoice in his kingdom, there should be nothing that would give us greater joy than to suffer, nor could there be any safer assurance that we are proceeding well in God's service.
2. This is what has consoled me now on learning of the death of this saintly lady, the Marchioness of Velada, over which I have experienced deep sorrow. Most of her life was a cross, so I hope in God that she is delighting in that eternity that has no end. Take courage, for when these trials are over -- and this will be soon, with the help of God -- you and Señor Albornoz will rejoice in having suffered them and will experience the benefit in your souls. I kiss his hands. I greatly wish you were here; it would be for me a great grace. May our Lord grant you every blessing, as he can and as I beg of him.
It is 17 September.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
