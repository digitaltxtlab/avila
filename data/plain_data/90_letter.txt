1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, padre and señor mio. Padre Julián de Avila and also Señor Maestro wrote me about the house of Juan de Avila de la Vega which is for sale. It is just right for us, both the price (which Padre Julián de Avila says will be little more than 1,000 ducats) and the location, which for our purpose is excellent. That it is close to you is sufficient.
2. I really think that it will be so old that there will be immediate need for repairs. That matters little if there is ample space and a well. I beg you to begin at once to confer about buying it, but without looking too eager because then they will raise the price.
3. My brother is going to Madrid and you can notify him there to send you the authorization. May the Lord direct matters, for it would be a great thing to have our own house. Because I have many letters to write I cannot go on at length. May God preserve you for me for many years and give me the opportunity to see you.
4. I think there is so much to do down here that I will have to stay a long while. I am well, and my brother kisses your hands many times.
Today is 9 October.
Your honor's unworthy servant and true friend,
Teresa of Jesus
