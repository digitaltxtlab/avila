25. For the Veiling of Sister Isabel De Los Angeles
 
So that you will be watchful, Sister,
Today they have veiled you;
On that your Heaven depends;
Do not be careless.
 
This veil so graceful
Proclaims you keep vigil,
The watchful sentinel
Awaiting her Bridegroom,
Who as the famed thief
Will come with surprise;
Do not be careless.
 
That hour is unknown,
What watch it will be,
First, second, or third;
All Christians know not,
So watch, watch, sister,
Lest your treasure be stolen.
Do not be careless.
 
Hold always in your hand
A candle bright;
Veiled, keep the watch
With loins girded well.
Be free of deep sleep,
Mindful of the danger near.
Do not be careless.
 
Keep ready your oil jar
Of merit and deeds,
Ample to keep
Your lamp aflame
Lest outside you be kept
When He comes.
Do not be careless.
 
No one will lend you oil
If you hasten to buy it;
Late you could be,
Once the Bridegroom is within,
The door then is closed;
Your cries will avail you not.
Do not be careless.
 
Be constant in care,
Fulfilling all bravely,
What you vowed today
Until death comes.
In keeping well your watch,
With the Bridegroom you will enter.
Do not be careless.
