1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I wrote the enclosed letter some days ago. This one is to beg Señor Albornoz to do me the favor of helping my nephew Gonzalo in every way he can. I would like to know that he has something to gain by my being the servant of your honors, and so I beg you to help me in this regard.
2. I am writing to my lady, the duchess, to ask her grace to have him removed from the list of her pages, for I think he is a grown man. And I know that Señor Albornoz can do a great deal. Since the pages live together, I have a real fear they will make him leave for some far off place, saying that he is too old to be a page. If I knew that he would be serving the Lord, it wouldn't matter to me, but the situation in Italy is dangerous. May His Majesty protect him as he can and grant you a safe delivery.
3. I was happy to learn more details from my sister about you and about that angel you have. May God preserve him for us and grant your honors what I beg of him for you. The more I look at the statue the more beautiful it seems, and the crown is lovely. I am thinking of bringing it with me when I return.
Today is the last day of October.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
