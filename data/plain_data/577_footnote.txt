For as I have said, after everything was considered, grave reasons were found for deciding that this was the best course of action, that is: that the chaplain, if there be one, serve as the ordinary confessor and that when a soul feels the need, confession may be made to persons like the ones mentioned. These may be named by the bishop, or if the Mother Prioress is such that the bishop entrusts this task to her, she may name them on her own. Since there are few nuns, they will take little of anyone's time. This practice was decided upon after much prayer by many persons including myself -- although wretched -- and among many persons of great learning, intelligence, and prayer. So I hope in the Lord it is the most fitting thing to do.
