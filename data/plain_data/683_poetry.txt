26. For the Profession of Isabel De Los Angeles
 
In weeping be my joy,
My rest in fright,
In sorrowing my serenity,
My wealth in losing all.
 
Amid storms by my love,
In the wound my delight.
My life in death,
In rejection my favor.
 
In poverty be my riches,
My triumph in struggling,
Rest in laboring,
In sadness my contentment.
 
In darkness be my light,
My greatness in the lowly place,
My way on the short road,
In the cross my glory.
 
In humiliation be my honor,
My palm in suffering
Increase in my wanting
In losing my gain.
 
My fullness be in hunger,
In fearing my hope,
My rejoicing in fear,
In grieving my delight.
 
In forgetting be my memory,
Humiliation my exalting,
In lowliness my repute,
Affronts my victory.
 
My laurels be in contempt,
In afflictions my fondness,
My dignity a lowly nook,
In solitude my esteem.
 
In Christ be my trust,
My affection in Him alone,
In His weariness my vigor,
My repose in His imitation.
 
My strength is founded here,
In him alone my surety,
My integrity's proof,
In His likeness my purity.
