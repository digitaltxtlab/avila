1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be in your souls, and may he grant that your good desires be lasting ones. It seems to me, my ladies, that Doña Mariana, the daughter of Francisco Juárez has had more courage, since for six years she has had to bear the displeasure of her mother and father and has been relegated to a small town. How much she would give to have the freedom you have in being able to confess at San Gil.
2. It is not as easy as you think to receive the habit in this way. Even though you are determined in your desire, I do not think you are so holy that you will not afterward grow tired of suffering the loss of your father's favor. Thus, it is preferable that you pray to our Lord for your father and leave the matter to His Majesty, who can change hearts and provide other means. And when we are most detached, he will so arrange things that everyone will be pleased. Right now, what must be fitting is to wait. His judgments are different from ours.
3. Be content with knowing that a place is being reserved for you, and abandon yourselves into God's hands so that his will may be done in you. This is what perfection consists of, and the rest could be a temptation.
4. May His Divine Majesty bring about what he sees as best. Certainly, if it were a matter of my will alone, I would at once comply with your desires. But, as I said, there are many things that have to be considered.
Your honors' servant,
Teresa of Jesus
