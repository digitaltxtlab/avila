1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I am in Segovia, and very worried, and I will continue to be so until I hear how your health is. For I don't understand why it is that immediately after Pedro de Ahumada left, I received a letter from you and then have heard nothing more from Avila. I am afraid that you might be sick that for this reason the nuns at St. Joseph's are not writing to me.
2. Padre Fray Antonio, who will be seeing you, is bringing this letter and will give you an account of everything. As a result, and because I am very busy, I am not going to be long and will leave it to him.
3. The marriage of the gentleman about which you wrote me did not come about, nor were they in favor of it here. The prioress speaks so well of the young lady that I would consider it most fortunate if she were brought into our family. The prioress is a good friend of hers and is having her come to see me. We will try in roundabout ways to have the prioress send out a feeler to see if you could approach her on such a matter. May the Lord bring about whatever will render him the most service, and may he watch over you.
4. Let me know quickly about your health. I wrote to you from Toledo. I don't know if you received the letter. My best regards to Don Francisco; Padre Gracián who is here sends his also. May God keep you and make you very holy, amen. We arrived here the day before yesterday.
Today is 15 June.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
