10. When I heard about this matter, I was closer to you, for in May I left that place for where I am now. Our Lord, who so ordained things, must have known this to be better. By leaving everything in his hands -- your desires and mine, since all must be directed to his glory -- the Lord will ordain that what is for the best will come about.
11. I am sending through this messenger a request to the licentiate Juan Bautista, who is the priest in Malagón, that he pay you a visit. During the time I was there, he was most gracious and helped in everything, both spiritual and temporal, for the Lord gave him talents in all these matters. He will inquire about your aims and inform you about our way of life (for, as our confessor, he came to know all about it). In this way we won't be left in the dark on a matter so important. I don't think he'll refuse this act of charity.
12. You can speak with him about your concerns as with one who is completely familiar with my goals. Whatever he says in my place and agrees to, you can believe as though it were I speaking. May the Lord direct everything and make your honor his great servant, something I will beg of His Majesty from now on. The news that Father Guardian gave me about the works our Lord does through you obliges me to do this.
13. You are also especially obliged to pray for Father Guardian. He traveled a number of leagues for this matter only, and this he did on foot and discalced, which makes it more praiseworthy, as does the fact that he has devoted himself to my project as if it were his own. Indeed it is for the glory of our Lord and the honor of the glorious Virgin Mary.
Written in Avila in the monastery of St. Joseph, 28 June 1568.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
