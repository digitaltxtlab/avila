1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. If I had known that you were in this area, I would have answered your letter before, for I longed to tell you what great consolation it gave me. May the Divine Majesty repay you with the spiritual blessings that I always beg of him.
2. During the time of the foundation in Burgos, there were so many trials, so little health, and so many things to do that not much time remained for this joy. Glory to God that the work is over and done well.
3. I would very much like to go there where you are, for it would give me great happiness to speak with you in person about some things, which can't be done through letters. There aren't many instances where our Lord allows me to do my own will. May the will of His Divine Majesty be done, which is what matters.
4. I would very much like to see the biography of my lady the marchioness. My lady the abbess, your sister, must have received my letter late, but I don't think she sent me the account so that she could read it herself. You are very right in wanting so holy a life to be remembered. Please God you will include all that you have to say, for I fear you will cut it short.
5. Oh lord, how much I suffered to get the parents of my niece to leave her in Avila until my return from Burgos! Since they saw how persistent I was about it, I succeeded.
6. May God preserve you, for you take such care to favor them in everything; I hope that you will be their support. May God watch over you for many years with the holiness I always beg of him, amen.
From Palencia, 12 August 1582.
Your honor's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
