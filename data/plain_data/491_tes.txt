1. While I was at the monastery in Toledo, some were advising me that I shouldn't give a burying-place to anyone who had not belonged to the nobility. The Lord said to me: "You will grow very foolish, daughter, if you look at the world's laws. Fix your eyes on me, poor and despised by the world. Will the great ones of the world, perhaps, be great before me? Or, are you to be esteemed for lineage or for virtue?"
(This concerned the advice they gave me not to grant a burying-place in Toledo to one who did not belong to the nobility).
