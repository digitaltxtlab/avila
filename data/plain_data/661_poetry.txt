4. Loving Colloquy
 
If the love You have for me,
Is like the love I have for You,
My God, what detains me?
Oh, what is delaying You?
-- Soul, what is it you desire of me?
-- My God, nothing other than to see You.
-- What is it that you fear more than self?
-- What I fear most is the loss of You.
A soul hidden in God,
What has it to desire
Save to love more and more,
And, in love all hidden
Again and again to love You?
 
One all possessing love I ask
My God, my soul centered in You,
Making a delightful nest,
A resting place most pleasing.
