1. I tell you -- and for the love of God always be attentive to this if you do not want to see your house lost -- that the price of things is so increasing that a house needs close to 300,000 maravedis in income when it is not a house of poverty. With the amount actually being given, the nuns in this house -- which will then acquire the reputation of receiving an income -- will starve to death; no doubt about it.
2. You should realize that if it depended on me I would not want to see any of the houses now founded in poverty to have an income. For I understand and see it now, and it will always be so: the communities that do not fail God will prosper most. If they fail him, it's better that they come to naught, for there are too many relaxed monasteries.
3. May God pardon those who opposed the foundations, for these foundations were a means for setting things right. And since the foundations were not well established, this opposition did much harm. His Majesty will provide a remedy; nothing short of this is possible. But until then, you must proceed very cautiously when giving permission to receive nuns. This should be done only if there is great need and it would be beneficial for the house. The well-being of a house requires that there be no more nuns than can be maintained. If careful attention is not paid to this, we will end up with unsolvable problems ...
4. It would be better not to make a foundation than to bring in melancholic nuns who will ruin the house.
