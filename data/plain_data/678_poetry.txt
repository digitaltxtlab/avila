21. To Saint Andrew
 
If suffering for love's sake
Can give such wondrous delight?
What joy will gazing on You be?
 
What will it be beholding
The Majesty eternal
Since Andrew seeing the cross
Was so filled with rejoicing?
Oh, how can it be wanting,
Delight in suffering's midst!
What joy will gazing on You be?
 
Love, when it has grown,
Save in laboring cannot live,
Nor the hearty without fighting
Because of love for his Beloved.
By this love is victory won
And the desire to be right in all.
What joy will gazing on You be?
 
Since all people dread dying,
Why is it sweetness to You?
Oh, I will live
In a loftier way.
By Your death, O my God,
The weakest knows strength.
What joy will gazing on You be?
 
O cross, wood so precious
Majestic and grand!
Once greatly despised,
Now espoused to God,
With rejoicing I come,
Unworthy to love you.
What joy will gazing on You be?
