1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. The clock will soon strike two, and so I can't be long, I mean two o'clock in the night. For this reason I can't write to the good Nicolao; wish him a happy New Year. Today, his cousin's wife was here. That man who wants to found a monastery is always in the same frame of mind. He persists with his good desire, but since the business in Madrid that would allow it is not concluded and Padre Mariano is not coming here, things remain the same.
2. I am delighted that you have received such a good nun. Give my regards to her and to all the sisters. I was also delighted with the letters from my brother that you sent me. What makes me sorry is that you don't say anything about your health; may God grant you the health I desire for you. He does us a great favor by giving it to our padre. May he be forever blessed.
3. The muleteer brought me your letters for Malagón. I don't know if he brought the money. It would have been really foolish not to accept what my brother is giving you -- would that it had been more. It will be kind of you if you send me the sweets you mentioned if they are especially good, for I would like to have them for a particular need.
4. I am well, although the days before Christmas I was somewhat down and got worn out from too many business matters. Despite it all, I did not break the Advent observance. Give my regards to all the people you think you should, especially to Padre Antonio de Jesús, and ask him if he has made a vow not to answer me. Greetings to Fray Gregorio. I am very happy that you have enough to make your annual payment. God will provide the rest. May His Majesty watch over you, for I have been wanting to see a letter from you.
Today is the feast of St. John the Evangelist.
Your reverence's,
Teresa of Jesus
