1. Jesus be with your honor and may His Majesty repay you for the joy and help you have given me today. I also have a desire and if you do not do what you can to fulfill it, I will think it would have been better for me not to have known you, so much will my suffering be. And my trial is this: it doesn't make me happy for you to go to heaven, for you have much to do in God's church. I begged God urgently today not to allow so good a mind to be occupied in anything else.
2. These sisters kiss your hands. You have brought them much consolation. Let me know if you got tired and how you are; but not by mail, for as happy as I would be to receive a letter from you, I wouldn't want to tire you any more than I think necessary, and that is already a lot. I am very happy this evening because of a visit with a father of our order, even though I neglected to send a message to the marchioness, for he is passing through Escalona.
The letter for Alba is going in a very safe way. And I am your honor's daughter and servant,
Teresa of Jesus
