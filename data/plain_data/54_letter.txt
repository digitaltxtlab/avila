1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, amen. I have come here to proceed at once toward getting these sisters settled. I don't have much time and because of this and also because the desirable season for constructing walls is nearly over, I was sorry not to find you here. The license from the king has arrived, and it's necessary to have it verified at once.
2. I beg you please to come quickly; since the matter is so important, I hope in God that you will not become irritated with me. May the Lord guide everything for his greater service and may he always lead you by the hand.
3. The house seems good to me, although more than 500 ducats will be necessary before entering it. Nonetheless, I am pleased and I hope in our Lord that you will be pleased in seeing it put to such good use. May the Lord grant you many years. Remember, the work has to begin during the good season and so it's a pity to see these days wasted.
4. For the love of God do us the favor of coming at once. And if you delay, I beg you to agree to our beginning to make the partition walls, for more than two hundred are needed; this will do no harm to the house. If afterward the agreement is not finalized (which is why I hope in God you will come quickly), the loss will be ours.
5. When you arrive, everything can be worked out. May His Majesty give you a long life so that you may ever gain more merit for eternal life.
Today is 2 August.
Your honor's unworthy servant, who kisses your hands,
Unworthy,
Teresa of Jesus
