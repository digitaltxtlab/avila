1. Jesus be with your reverence, mi padre. It's a trial to have to be in such far away places and without your reverence, which displeases me very much. May God give you health. There must have been a great need in that house if our padre agreed to allow you to be separated from him. The humility of your letter made me very happy, even though I don't plan on doing what you say so that you learn to suffer. Look, mi padre, all beginnings are difficult, and so this one of yours will be so for now.
2. Regarding what you say about the disadvantages of learning, it would be truly unfortunate if in so short a time this defect were already noticeable. It would be better to have no learning than to show this so soon. You shouldn't think that the business of governing lies in always knowing your faults, for it is necessary so as to carry out your office to forget yourself often and recall that you stand in the place of God. He will give you what you lack, for this is what he does with everyone since no one is perfect. So don't be shy and fail to write to our padre about the way things appear to you.
3. A short time ago, I sent another packet of letters to you through Señora Doña Juana.
May God watch over you and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
