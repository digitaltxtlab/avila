1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. God reward you for favoring me with your letter and the news of your plan to come here with Señora Doña María. You will be most welcome.
2. You are right to be happy, for I don't know what greater fortune God could give you than to call your daughter to a state where in serving His Majesty a person can live with more peace than anyone can imagine. I hope in the Lord that this will be for his great service.
3. On the one hand, I long for you to come, like someone who for a long while has had no cause for any great joy. On the other hand, I don't like to think of you having to undertake such a long trip when you could be excused, for I desire your health more than my satisfaction. I am writing to our Father Visitator about this and about his coming with you, for there are many drawbacks to it. What he decides will be the best thing to do.
4. May it please the Lord to deliver us from these times in which we have to fear even what is very good, for eyes full of suspicion are watching. The letter you said you wrote me, I never got.
5. All these sisters and the prioress kiss your hands. They very much look forward to your coming and that of Señora Doña María. May the Lord direct everything according to what best serves him. In Valladolid they are already getting the material for her habit.
6. May His Majesty watch over you and the Lord Secretary. I kiss your hands and the hands of all those ladies, especially of Señora Doña Adriana, although she has very much forgotten me.
Today is April 17.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
7. My Isabel de Jesús is already writing to me; there is no end to the nuns' happiness with her, and rightly so.
