I tell you that Joseph is right in letting him sleep. I am delighted, for from the time you left I begged for this with insistent prayers since it seems to me something necessary. And I almost believe that he is doing it for me -- in fact I do believe it -- since I begged for this so fervently. At least with that sleep the work will be bearable. Nonetheless, it seems to me that you are allowing yourself very little, for if you are going to Matins and getting up early, I don't know how you are getting enough sleep.
