1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. Because Father Rector and the prioress will tell you about how we arrived here, I will not enlarge on the matter.
2. I greatly desire to know how your health is and how your business affairs are going. I have more time here -- if I could benefit from it -- than anywhere else to pray for you. May it please our Lord that I be good for something, for there is no lack of desire in me that you have good health and much holiness. I am far better than I was there, although I have the usual ailments, especially the palsy; but without the fever and nausea that I had in Segovia, I am doing well.
3. When I arrived from Avila, they told me that the documents from Rome had arrived and were in accord with our proposal. I haven't heard anything more. I beg you, since this messenger has to return, to inform me about everything -- especially about your health.
4. The prioress is fine; she begs for your prayers. She carries out her office very well. May our Lord make you a great saint.
Today is the 8th.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
