1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your paternity. I have been so occupied since the arrival of the messenger who is bringing this letter that I feared being unable to write even these lines lest I leave my duties undone.
2. Señora Doña Juana tells me that you are not well and have a rash and that they were wanting to bleed you. This brother tells me you are very well and portly looking, which took away my distress. You must be suffering from the heat. I have been afraid of it. For goodness' sake, try not to stay in Alcalá any more than necessary. I am doing fairly well. Next Thursday I will be leaving for Salamanca. I am very happy to see how our Lord is guiding the affairs. May he be always praised, and go ahead and speak now that you can, if for no other reason than that you find some relief among so many trials.
4. I have written you twice from here. Sister María de San José is in good health and is an angel. Everything is going very well here, and thanks to the novice who has just entered the income is as usual sufficient. She is also an angel and very happy. May the Lord be with you, for my head is exhausted.
5. I tell you that I laugh when I think that they made you rest for your penance and left us here to do battle unto the end. Please God we will soon see victory, and may he give you health which is what is important.
6. Mother Prioress sends her best regards. She says she doesn't want to write to you until you answer her. She's smarter than I am.
Today is the feast of Santiago.
Your paternity's servant and true daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
