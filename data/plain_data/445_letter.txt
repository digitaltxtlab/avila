1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Our Father Provincial asked me to tell you that he received a letter from his father who was going to Rome and said that on his way he would stop to speak with him in Soria. So Father Provincial could not delay and had to leave this morning. He would very much have liked to see you, but he was so busy yesterday that he couldn't. I beg you to pray for him. We are left very much alone. For this reason I beg you to remember that from now on you have daughters and that I am so wretched that you must not forget me. Mother Prioress and all the nuns kiss your hands.
2. They say the reception of the habit will take place on Friday. His excellency will give it. May God give us himself so that we don't feel these absences and may he watch over you with a great increase in sanctity. Before you speak with any of the clergy about staying here, you need to speak to me. But if you do come across someone, don't let the opportunity pass.
Your honor's unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus
