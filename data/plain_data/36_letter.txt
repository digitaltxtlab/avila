Jesus
My daughter and my lady,
1. To receive God's help is better than early rising. You are hereby being admitted to this house with the approval of all the sisters. I would have liked to give you the habit before departing, but that is not possible since I will be leaving early tomorrow morning. We will meet sometime in the future.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
