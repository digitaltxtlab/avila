11. To the Birth of Jesus
 
Ah, shepherds watching,
Guarding your flocks!
Behold, a Lamb born for you,
Son of our Sovereign God.
 
Poor and despised He comes,
Begin now guarding Him,
Lest the wolf carry Him off.
Before rejoicing in Him,
Bring me your crook, Giles.
Firmly will I grasp it,
Preventing theft of the Lamb:
See you not He is Sovereign God?
 
Come now, bewildered am I
By joy and sorrow joined.
If today God be born,
How can He then die?
Oh, since He is man as well,
Life in His hands will be!
In this Lamb behold,
The Son of our Sovereign God.
 
Why do they ask for Him
And then against Him war.
Giles, in faith it would be better
For Him to return to His land.
If by sin we are banished,
In His hand all good lies
Since to suffer He came,
This God truly sovereign.
 
His suffering so little troubles you:
Oh, how true of men.
When profit comes,
Evil we ignore!
Do you see He gains renown
As the Shepherd of the great flock?
Terrible it is nonetheless
That the Sovereign God should die.
