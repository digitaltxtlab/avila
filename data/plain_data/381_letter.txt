For my daughter, María Bautista, Valladolid.
1. ... I am very sorry and feel greatly distressed in seeing that the devil is striving in every way he can to do us harm. May our Lord set things right and give you good health, which is what matters.
2. I was sorry about the illness of María de la Cruz. God must want you to be a saint since he gives you the cross in so many ways. Those who suffer the illness she thinks she has never have a fever or that nausea, but appear to be strong and in good health.
3. The confessor did her great harm by not understanding her; I saw that. Inform the chaplain about this for me and give him my best. And do not allow Estefanía those times of solitude and fasting, if you don't want to end up with another similar case.
4. Doña Ana Enríquez has just written me, and I have felt very sorry about her trials. Well, this is the path on which those who want to enjoy him must walk, for it is the one he took. May he be with you and watch over you for me, amen.
