1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be with your lordship. I was greatly consoled to learn about the state of your health. May it please our Lord that you continue to improve. I have prayed much to His Majesty for you; would you now do the same for me. I need your prayers because of the long distances I will have to be traveling.
2. I am writing to Father Rector about the command Father Visitator has given me; you may ask him about it. He told me to write to you about how he had given me orders to stay at St. Joseph's. He also told me that Father Prior of Atocha had written him that the nuncio said that because it seemed to him a good thing he was giving permission for the monastery. He didn't tell me to write about this to you; he must have thought that you knew of it from the nuncio. I have learned that he desires to please you in everything, which made me happy. And I would be glad if that cleric were to stay in your house, if that's agreeable to you.
3. Padre Gómez has been here several times, which seems to me a good thing. He told me he wanted to know if that person who left here was in agreement with you, for he knew that he was in Salamanca. I urged him to pray for you since your health was bad, and he took on the obligation. We are also praying for the matter you entrusted to our prayers, that our Lord will bring about what will be for his greater service. May His Majesty show his power, and may he guide you. I didn't really have the time to write to you today, so I won't enlarge on this.
Today is 15 September.
Your lordship's unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
