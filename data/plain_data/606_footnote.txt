Don't be like some nuns that do nothing but promise; and since they don't keep anything, they say they didn't understand what they promised when they made profession. I believe this because it is easy to talk and difficult to act. And if they thought that words are equal to deeds, they certainly didn't understand. Make those who will profess vows here learn through a long trial period not to think their life will amount to words alone, without deeds also. So I want you to know whom you are dealing with, as they say, and what the good Jesus offers the Father through you and what you are giving when you pray that His will be done in you, for you are giving nothing else than that.
