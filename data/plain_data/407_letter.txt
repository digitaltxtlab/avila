1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, and may His Majesty repay you for the kindness you showed me with your letter and the consolation it brought. I received it while in Soria. Now I am in Avila where Father Provincial sent me to stay until, our Lord be pleased, the cardinal gives us permission to make a foundation in Madrid. It would be a very long time for me to have to wait until his illustrious lordship goes to Madrid, for since he has to convoke the bishops in Toledo, I think Lent will go by first. So I am trusting that he will do me this favor beforehand, if for no other reason than to prevent me from having to spend the winter in such severe weather as one finds here in Avila, for it usually does me much harm. I beg you not to forget to remind him from time to time. In the letter he wrote to me in Soria, he did not expand on the matter.
2. Now I am writing him about this affair concerning Señora Doña Elena, which causes me much grief, and I am sending him a letter that she wrote me, for from what she says, if we do not receive her in this order, she wants to go to the Franciscans. I am very disturbed, for she will never be happy there from what I understand of her spirit, which is more suited to our order. And, after all, her own daughter is here and she is near her children.
3. I beg you to pray for this and try to get his illustrious lordship to answer me, for she is most distressed, and since I love her so much, I feel very sad about it and don't know what to do for her.
4. This is meant for you alone. May our Lord watch over you with the increase of holiness that I beg of him for you.
Written in St. Joseph's on 13 September.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
