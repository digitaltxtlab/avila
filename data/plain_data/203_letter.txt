1. Jesús. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Our padre, Master Fray Jerónimo Gracián, spoke to me of his fondness for you and how much he trusts that without trouble you will do everything you can to help me; and that is no small thing since I have so many business matters to take care of. And so from now on I will turn to you with the letters destined for our padre, which is what matters the most to me. But this must be on the condition that you contribute no more than the effort involved, and in all simplicity we will take care of the postage; otherwise I would not want to accept your favor.
2. If there is any way in which I can be of assistance to you, I will do so gladly if I can. I beg you to send these letters to the parties they are addressed to.
Today is 14 July.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
