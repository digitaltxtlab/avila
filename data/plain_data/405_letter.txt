For Mother Prioress of the discalced Carmelite nuns, behind San Francisco in Seville.
1. Jesus be with you, my daughter. I arrived last night, 4 September, in this town of Villacastín, really tired of traveling, for I am coming from the foundation in Soria on my way to Avila, with more than forty leagues to go. We got into many troubles and dangers. Despite everything, I am well, glory to God, and that new monastery is going well also. May God be pleased to make use of all the suffering, for that makes it worthwhile.
2. When he saw that everything was ready for my departure, Padre Acacio García came to the inn here to see me -- for Sister San Francisco knows him well -- and said that he had a reliable messenger. I am now writing these lines so that my daughters will have news of me.
3. I am very happy to learn that the pestilence is gone and that you are all well. The Lord shows his love for you. Our Father is also well; he is in Salamanca. Padre Nicolao is awaiting me in Avila, for he is going to Rome (which I am very sorry about) to get better confirmation of our affairs, for the king has desired this. He has been sick with typhus fever, but now is well. Pray fervently for him, for everyone owes this to him.
4. My daughter: the two hundred ducats have not reached me. They tell me that Señor Horacio de Oria has them. If that is so, they are in good hands. I have already told you to send them to me by way of Medina. I would now like to begin the chapel for my brother -- God give him glory -- for this is on my conscience. Would you give orders that they be sent to me, for otherwise I cannot take them into account.
5. May our Lord watch over you and all the nuns for me, and make you all as holy as I beg of him, amen, amen and allow me to see you.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
