For Mother Prioress in Salamanca.
1. Jesus be with your reverence. Let me know how you are and how all the nuns are as well, and give them my regards. Tell them I would like to be enjoying their company along with that of the nuns here. I believe I will have less difficulty here than I thought. And from my hermitage, and also from where I sleep, there's a view of the river -- I can enjoy it while in bed, a most refreshing experience for me. I have felt better today than usual. Doña Quiteria has her customary fever; she says she misses all of you. They have brought a doctor here for Señora Doña Jerónima, for she is still sick. Pray for her there, as we are doing so here; I am worried about her. May God guide you.
2. The duchess sent me this trout today. It looked so good that I got this messenger to deliver it to my Padre Maestro Fray Bartolomé de Medina. If it arrives at dinner time, send it to him at once through Miguel, and this letter as well. And if it arrives later, send it to him anyway to see if he's willing to write a few lines.
3. Don't neglect to write me about how you are, and don't neglect to eat meat these days. Tell the doctor about your infirmity and give him my best regards. Anyway, may God be always with you, amen.
4. Give my regards to my Padre Osma and tell him I greatly miss him here. Let me know how Juana de Jesús is, for she had a very pale face the day I left.
Today is Wednesday after the twelfth, and I am yours,
Teresa of Jesus
5. How is the countess? And the magistrate's wife? Send someone to find out and let me know about it. I will write about how your sister is, for I did not want to send Navarro until I knew; through him I will also send you something. He will bring these sixteen reales, if I remember tomorrow, for today I also forgot. If Lescano should ask for something, give it to him, for I will repay you. I told him that if he needs something you would give it to him. I'm quite sure he will not ask.
