	1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor and repay you for the charity you have done me today. I thought I would have been able to speak with you, not so as to complain, for I had no motive for that, but for my consolation. See that you do not forget me in your prayers. That will now leave me all the more obliged to you by reason of the poverty of my own prayers.
2. I beg your honor to be very careful with these letters and to give them to Padre Lárez, for several of them deal with a most important matter. May the Lord go with you.
3. Tell our Father Provincial that the ones I am enclosing for Medina should be delivered only by a person who is very trustworthy, for they deal with the business matter I spoke about to you the other day, and there could come upon us many anxieties and obstacles to the service of God. They should be delivered to Padre Ordóñez as soon as possible. If this cannot be done, would you send them back to me.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
