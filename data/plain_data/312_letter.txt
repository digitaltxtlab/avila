To the Illustrious Señor Pedro Juan Casademonte, in Medina, my lord.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I had not written you because they told me you were in Valladolid. I was happy that you and Señora Doña María arrived there in good health. I rejoice that you are going to Madrid because you will help me there in everything as always. Let me know where you will be staying, for I have many letters to send you there.
2. You may have learned how well the negotiations within the order have gone. As for what you wrote to me about Rome, it grieves me that they are so financially pressed. I have already written to them, and if Padre Nicolao has not sent the letters, do me the favor of sending them.
3. In regard to the dispensation, the one involved came here to speak with me. He is very sorry that they failed him. Soon, with the help of God, it will be given.
4. In respect to the fifty ducats about which you wrote, I sent a message to Padre Nicolao to pay you, for he has my ducats.
5. I am delighted that the good Padilla is well. If you write to him, please give him my regards.
6. I kiss Señora Doña María's hands. Mother Prioress kisses those of your honor. All of the nuns are concerned about your business affair. May the Lord work it out for his holy service and watch over you with an increase of his grace.
At St. Joseph's in Salamanca, 10 October.
Please pardon my having another person write this for me; my head is in a bad condition.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
