1. Jesus be with your honor. Whether here or there, God gives us all trials; may he be ever blessed. You ought not grieve over the departure of Don Gonzalo with Lorencico, for my brother will not give his consent nor does he think it opportune. I did not write to him because the servant lad had left by the time they gave me the letter. Now I am praying for both boys.
2. You should know that our trials of every kind at this time have reached a peak, for we have received a counter-brief and now must all remain subject to the nuncio. It doesn't distress me very much, for it seems perhaps to be a better path toward our becoming a province; and we will not have to see Padre Gracián among those people.
3. I am in such a hurry that I don't even know how I am managing to write this, for I am sending some counsels to those houses there. I only ask that they pray for me. I am my usual self, for trials are health and medicine for me.
4. Many greetings to Señor Juan de Ovalle and to Doña Beatriz; the nuns here send their greetings to you. My brothers are well. They still don't know that Pedro is going there.
It is August 8, and I am yours,
Teresa of Jesus
