27. To a Professed Nun
 
Oh, blessed this shepherdess
Given today to this Shepherd
Who rules and will rule.
 
Good fortune was hers
Meriting such a Spouse.
Giles, now I am fearful:
No more will I gaze on her
For a husband she has taken
Who rules and will rule.
 
Ask her what she gave Him
To carry to His farm.
With such delight
She gave her heart.
Oh, what a trifle she paid,
So handsome is the Shepherd
Who rules and will rule.
 
Much greater present would she give.
Dear, why chide her?
We will accept this dowry small
She brings us now,
For a husband she has
Who rules and will rule.
 
Now knowing what she gave,
What is the shepherd's gift?
He purchased her with His blood.
Oh fortune so precious,
Happy this shepherdess
Who delights this Shepherd!
 
With what great love He should give
For his gift was such a treasure.
He gave all, do you not see her
Fully clothed by Him?
See, now He is her Husband
Who rules and will rule.
 
Good it is that we take her
As a member of our flock.
Let us entertain her,
Her friendship to gain,
For a husband she has taken
Who rules and will rule.
