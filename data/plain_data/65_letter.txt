1. Jesus. May the grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. It's a wonderful thing when one finds oneself in need to have a good treasurer like you. At present I am in great need and so I beg you to give Señor Julián de Avila whatever you can spare from your accounts; it will go to pay the cost of the travel, which was borrowed. As a receipt you can use this letter with my signature. And will you pray for me as I do for you, despite my wretchedness; the same to Señor Maestro and my good sister, Señora Catalina Daza.
2. It makes me feel very lonely to be so far from those I love so much. If I hadn't resolved to live with the cross, I would be suffering a great trial. May our Lord give you the peace I desire for you along with much holiness.
The date is the fourth of June in the year fifteen hundred and seventy-four. From this house of St. Joseph in Segovia.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
