Señor Venegrilla:
Santos García brought ten bushels of wheat. Would you do me the favor of paying for the wheat, for I don't have the money. Señor Guzmán[2] will be pleased with this and will reimburse you, for that is what he usually does. 
Doña Teresa de Ahumada
Would you kindly send me some little pigeons.
