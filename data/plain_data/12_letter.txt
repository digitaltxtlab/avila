1. All these sisters kiss your lordship's hands many times.
For a year now we have been hoping that you would come to visit my Señora Doña María. Señor Don Bernardino assured us of this, and we were very happy about it. Our Lord did not will it. May it please His Majesty that I will see you in that place where there will be no separation. The psalms were recited this year on the same day, and this we will always do gladly. May our Lord always guide you and for his greater service preserve you for many years.
2. Señor Fray García is doing very well, glory to God. He is always gracious to us, and each day he is more dedicated to your service. He has undertaken an office given him by his provincial, that of novice master -- a lowly task for someone of his authority. But it was not given him for any other reason than that his spirit and virtue benefit the order and imbue those souls with that spirit. He accepted the office with so much humility that he was most edifying. He has much work to do. Today is 6 July.
Your lordship's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
Would you do me the favor of sending this padre quickly. It could be that a letter from you would be helpful.
