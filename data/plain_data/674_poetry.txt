17. On the Feast of the Holy Kings
 
Now that the star
Has come,
Accompany the Kings,
Go, my flock.
 
Together let us go
The Messiah to behold.
We see fulfilled now
The prophet's words:
In these our days,
At last He has come.
Accompany the Kings,
Go, my flock.
 
Our gifts so dear
Let us bring Him.
With fervor so full,
The Kings are coming.
Today may she rejoice,
Our shepherdess so grand.
Accompany the Kings,
Go, my flock.
 
Llorente, trouble not
In seeking a reason,
For He is God,
This young Boy.
While I in debt fall,
Give Him your heart.
Accompany the Kings,
Go, my flock.
