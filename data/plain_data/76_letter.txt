1. ... I tell you, mi padre, I think my joys are no longer of this kingdom, for what I want I do not have, and what I have I do not want. What is missing is that the happiness I used to experience in dealing with my confessors is no longer present; one would have to be more than a confessor. Anything less than what the soul desires does not fulfill it. Certainly, it has been a relief for me to write this. May God grant that your honor always find your relief in loving him.
2. Tell your "poca cosa," who is concerned about whether the sisters will vote for her or not, that she is thereby meddling and lacking in humility. For what you and those of us who look after the welfare of that house believe is best will be done rather than what one nun thinks, for we have more interest in a good choice. It is necessary that the nuns be made to understand these things. When you see Señora Doña María, give her my regards for I have not written for some time. It is a good thing that I am better in the midst of this cold weather.
I think it is 3 December, and I am your honor's daughter and servant.
Teresa of Jesus
