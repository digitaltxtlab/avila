To the Illustrious Señor Pedro de la Banda, my lord.
1. Everything your honor said is being carried out according to your wishes. From what everyone says, I am not obligated to all of this until the license arrives. But our having entered the house obliges me to comply with your orders, and please God you will be satisfied with everything.
2. May our Lord give you calm that you may serve him better, and may he always lead you by his hand.
Today is 8 October.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
