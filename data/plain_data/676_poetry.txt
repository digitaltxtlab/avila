19. The Way of the Cross
 
Within the cross is life
And consolation.
It alone is the road
Leading to heaven.
 
The Lord of heaven and earth
Is on the cross.
On it, too, delight in peace.
Though war may rage,
It banishes all evil
Dwelling here on earth.
It alone is the road
Leading to heaven.
 
From the cross the bride
To her Beloved says
This is a precious palm
Upon which she has climbed,
Its fruit tasting
Like the God of paradise:
It alone is the road
Leading to heaven.
 
This sacred cross,
An olive tree so dear,
With its oil anoints us
Giving us light.
My soul, take up this cross
Rich with consolations great.
It alone is the road
Leading to heaven.
 
This cross is the verdant tree
Desired by the bride.
In its cool shade
Now she is resting,
Delighting in her Beloved,
Heaven's King:
It alone is the road
Leading to heaven.
 
The soul to God
Is wholly surrendered,
From all the world
Now truly free,
The cross is at last
Her "Tree of Life" and consolation:
It alone is the road
Leading to heaven.
 
After our Savior
Upon the cross placed Himself,
Now in this cross is
Both glory and honor.
In suffering pain
There is life and comfort,
And the safest road
Leading to heaven.
