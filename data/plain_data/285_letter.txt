1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor and so favor you that you will gain through these trials. They have caused me grief, and so I am praying to our Lord for you, although I understand from another perspective that trials are favors His Majesty grants to those he loves deeply. He does this to awaken us so that we do not prize the things of this life -- which are so changeable and unstable -- but seek eternal life.
2. This year we have undergone so many storms and calumnies that at first I became all the more distressed by the imprisonment of Señor Albornoz. After learning that it happened over the matter of Don Fadrique, I am left with hope in God that the ordeal will not last long. I kiss his honor's hands and trust that the time will come when he will not want to exchange one day of his being in iron chains for all the golden chains of earth. May God be pleased to give him health, for it enables one to suffer trials better.
3. I don't feel so sorry in your regard, for I think our Lord has given you the resources to suffer even greater trials. May His Majesty increase his grace within you more and more and keep you for many years, amen.
Today is 4 February.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
