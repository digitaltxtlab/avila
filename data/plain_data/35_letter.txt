1. ... I should extend my best wishes ... nonetheless both made me happy. Some day would you go to see for me the nun who recently received the veil and speak at length with her and ask her to pray for me, as well as for all these business matters connected with the order.

May God be pleased to give you what I desire for you.
Your honor's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
