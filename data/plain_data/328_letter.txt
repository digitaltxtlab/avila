1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your paternity, mi padre. Seeing that I have a messenger as reliable as this brother, I did not want to miss a chance to write these lines even though I wrote you at length yesterday through Juan Vázquez, the one from Almodóvar.
2. Fray Antonio de la Madre de Dios was here and he preached three sermons that pleased me greatly. He seems to be a fine man. It gives me great consolation when I see persons like this among our friars. And I grieved over the death of the good Fray Francisco. May he be with God in heaven.
3. Oh, mi padre, how worried I am, if this foundation in Villanueva is made, that I won't find a prioress or nuns who will satisfy me! This San Angel from here seems to have some good qualities, as I wrote you, but since she was formed amid the liberties taken in this house, I am very fearful. Tell me what you think. And her health is very poor. Beatriz doesn't seem to me to have the qualities that I am looking for, although she has kept this house peaceful. Now that I have got over my worries about the house here, I find myself weighed down with concerns about another one.
4. As for Arenas, I think the Flemish nun, who is very calm after having provided for her daughters, will be good, and she has fine qualities. If God should will that the foundation in Madrid become a reality, I have Inés de Jesús. Recommend all of this to His Majesty, for it is very important to start off right; and tell me what you think, for goodness' sake.
May our Lord preserve you with the holiness I beg of him, amen. Today is 15 January.
Your paternity's unworthy daughter and subject.
Teresa of Jesus
