Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I received the papers and will do what you command. May our Lord repay you for the care you have shown. With my poor prayers, I will do what you ask, and so I beg you to keep me in yours, and do me the favor of telling his excellency, the duke, that my departure, God willing, will take place Monday. I am beseeching his excellency to see if he can render me some service, for he has so many things to do that I don't ask him for anything more, for which I kiss his hands. May our Lord guide him always.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
