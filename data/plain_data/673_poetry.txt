16. Another on the Circumcision
 
This little Child comes crying,
Look, Giles, He calls you.
 
To earth from heaven He came
Our warring to end.
Already the battle rages,
His blood is flowing:
Look, Giles, He calls you.
 
So strong is his loving,
His crying is without surprise.
Courage grows within Him,
For He is to lead.
Look, Giles, He calls you.
 
How great the price will be
Since He begins so young
Bleeding for us.
Oh, weeping we should be.
Look, Giles, He calls you.
 
Has He not come to die,
For in His dwelling He could stay.
Giles, do you see He has come
As a roaring lion?
Look, Giles, He calls you.
 
Pascual, why do you shout?
What do you want?
Love Him for He loves you
And shivers here for you.
Look, Giles, He calls you.
