1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. It has not been necessary for me to see you first to value as a very great favor the opportunity you offer me of kissing your hand. For after having learned how well you comprehend all that is good, I myself would have sought to procure the joy of meeting you, if possible. Thus, I beg you to believe that you will be doing me a great favor by coming here to meet me. And if you should come at a time in which we can be together for a longer period, my joy will increase. I had so little time on the feast of St. Thomas that I was happy when you put the visit off for another day.
2. With regard to what you say, it would seem rather to increase one's joy than impede it. There was no time to deal with matters of the soul and all the other things that would have added greatly to the joy. And how much you ought to do in the service of our Lord since you are in possession of such good doctrine. It truly seems that you deserve this. May it please our Lord that you lose nothing by coming to speak with this wretched servant. So be careful about what you are doing, for once you have extended your favor to her, you are obliged not to take it back. In all matters much is to be gained by being attentive in the beginning; then the end will be a good one. In this case, I think the end will have to be a good one. In sum, set the day and hour in which you would like to come, and you will be doing me a great favor by your visit. May our Lord always be your light and guide.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
