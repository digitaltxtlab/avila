1. ... If it is necessary for me to go now to Avila and let the other project go, it would be let go forever, it seems. But it occurs to me that if I am prioress and Fray Gregorio is there, I could be absent for a few months. I would greatly prefer having you nearby when this has to be decided. Please God this letter will go quickly, for you can answer me by way of Avila -- Padre Nicolao told me he would have a messenger sent -- and also by way of Palencia and Valladolid, for although the letters are slow in arriving, they write to me. Don't set aside one way for the other.
2. Please God you are well, for such bad lodging in this heat is a hard thing. I have envied your being near the river, though. It has always seemed to me that it would be a good place, at least so as to take possession of the foundation. Here it gets very hot at times, especially now as I am writing this. But the mornings and evenings are nice. All the nuns are well.
3. The prioress is carrying out her duties very well. As for this lady, she is extremely good. May God carry the work forward, for it seems that this foundation is a success, and may he watch over you for us, amen.
Today is 27 June.
