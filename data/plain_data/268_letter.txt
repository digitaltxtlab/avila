1. ... May God give you fortitude so that you remain steadfast in righteousness, even if you find yourself surrounded by great danger. Blessed are trials when, however heavy, they do not make one turn aside in the least from righteousness. I am not surprised that anyone who loves you wants to see you free of those dangers and looks for means toward this, although it would not be a good thing to abandon the Blessed Virgin in times of such great need. Certainly, Señora Juana would not give you such advice, nor would she consent to such a change. God deliver us. Nor by doing so would you be escaping trials but walking right into them. For these trials of ours with God's help will soon pass, but those of another order could perhaps go on for the rest of your life. You ought to consider this.
2. The more I think about your faculties as visitator being restored the worse it seems to me. Every day I would have to live with the shock of seeing you in a thousand battles of a thousand kinds. And, after all, I see that the honor of your being a visitator will not last any longer than a mouthful of bread, while our torment at seeing you in such danger could last always. For the love of God I beg you to refuse even if the nuncio himself orders it.
