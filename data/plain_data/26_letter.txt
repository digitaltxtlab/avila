1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be always with your honor. For some days your daughters -- and our sisters -- have been wanting to receive the holy habit of our Lady. Knowing that you have not been opposed to this, I decided to give it to them today, after observing the spirit and fervor with which they were asking me for it. I think this will be for the glory of God.
2. I beg you, out of charity, to accept this and to consider the favor His Majesty has shown you in giving you daughters he has chosen to be his brides. They are very consoled. Their only concern is for the sorrow this might have caused the both of you. For love of our Lord, may they not sense anything that could cause unrest to their souls so well prepared for this state. You will have them here -- something perhaps better than if they were elsewhere -- for your consolation, and you can consider all the nuns of this house to be your servants and capellanas.
May our Lord be always with your soul, and may he guide you, amen.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
