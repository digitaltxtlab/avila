Blessed be His name forever and ever, amen! And I ask the Eternal Father through Him to forgive my debts and great sins -- for I have had no one nor anything to forgive, and every day I have something that needs to be forgiven -- and give me grace so that one day I may have something to offer with my petition. That we might in some way appear to be sons of such a Father and brothers of such a Brother, Jesus taught us this sublime way of prayer and petitioned that we be angelic beings in this exile -- provided that we strive with every effort to make our deeds conform to our words. We may thus know that if, as I mention, we do what we say, the Lord will not fail to accomplish what we ask, will give us His kingdom, and help with supernatural things (the prayer of quiet and perfect contemplation and the other favors the Lord grants us in such prayer in return for our efforts). Everything is small as far as what we can strive for and obtain on our own. But since this is what we ourselves can do, very certainly the Lord will help us because His Son asks this for us.
