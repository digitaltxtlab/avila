So great was her thirst, so much was her desire increasing that she understood dearly it would have been possible to die of love if the raptures hadn't soothed the thirst. Blessed be He who in His Gospel invites us to drink! Thus, since in our Lord and our Good there cannot be anything imperfect, He gives us what we need; it belongs to Him alone to give us this water.
