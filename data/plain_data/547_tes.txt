1. On the feast of the Presentation while praying to God very intensely for a person, it seemed to me it was still unbecoming the great sanctity I desired for this person that he have his freedom and an income. I considered his poor health and the abundant light he gave to souls, and I heard: "He serves Me very much, but it is a great thing to follow me stripped of everything as I was on the cross. Tell him to trust in me." He mentioned the latter because I had concluded that this person couldn't reach such perfection with his poor health.
