1. On the day the brief was presented, while I was anxiously waiting, I was all troubled and couldn't even pray vocally. For they had come to tell me our Father's life was in danger. It wasn't allowed for him to leave the monastery and there were so many rumors. I heard these words: "O woman of little faith! Be calm, for things are going very well."
2. It was the feast of the Presentation of our Lady, in the year 1575. I resolved within myself that if the Virgin would obtain from her Son that we see both our Father and ourselves freed from these friars, I would ask our Father for an indult that in all of our monasteries of the discalced nuns this feast could be celebrated with solemnity.
3. When I made this resolve I didn't recall what I had heard in the vision I'd seen, that the Father would establish a feast. Now in turning back to read this little notebook, I have wondered if the feast could be this one of the Presentation.
