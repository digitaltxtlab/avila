1. Jesus watch over your reverence for me. I wrote you a long letter today, and so I will not enlarge on this one because of my many other occupations; we had a profession today and I am really tired.
2. For the foundation in Granada I have given the order that they take two nuns from there, and I am trusting that you won't give the worst. So I ask this of you please, for you well know how important it is that they be very virtuous and competent. In this way you will have more room so that you can accept some new nuns and repay me sooner, for it pains me to have to leave for Burgos without any work having been begun on my brother's chapel. And they tell me I am obliged in conscience to have this built. I tell you this so that you will realize that I cannot wait much longer to get the work started.
3. So, do what you can to send me the money, and pray for me, because after Christmas I am going to make that foundation in Burgos -- and that region is very cold at this time. If it were close to where you are and I knew I would get to see you, the trip wouldn't bother me at all. But our Lord will arrange that we meet again some day.
4. My health is reasonably good, thanks be to God, for through your prayers and those of all the nuns, the Lord is helping me bear the trials. Teresa sends regards to you and all the sisters.
May His Majesty keep you for me and make you as holy as he can, amen.
From this house in Avila, November twenty-eighth.
Many regards to all the sisters.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
