28. For a Profession
 
Oh, what good unequalled!
Oh, marriage most sacred!
That the King of Majesty,
Should be Betrothed.
 
Ah, wondrous happening
Ready now for you!
God wants His bride
Having won you by His death!
In serving Him be strong
For you are vowed to this.
Already the King of Majesty
Is your Betrothed.
 
Bright jewels will He give
This heavenly Spouse -- King:
He comforts you greatly
No one can deprive you of this.
Of all that He blesses you,
A humble spirit is the best,
For the King all this is given easily,
He longs this day to be betrothed.
 
The Lord will grant you
Love holy and pure.
You will forget
The world's fears,
Ah, much more, the devil, too.
Now the demon is manacled today
 
The King of Majesty
Is now betrothed.
