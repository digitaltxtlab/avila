1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I looked at the address and I am grateful that in responding you removed the title "illustrious."

2. May the Lord hear our prayer and repay you for the favor you showed me with your letter, for I was afraid about the condition of your health. I am already desiring to see another letter with news that Beatriz is improving. May God bring this about. The letters I brought still haven't been delivered because I am waiting ...

I mentioned what a bad impression that made in the city. I am taking great care to deliver the letters as soon as possible. Please God no one will send them elsewhere. Tell this to Isabel de Trazanos and give her my regards.
3. You should know that the abbess of Santa Dorotea gave me two ducats without knowing ...
Remain with God, for I have much to do ... My throat is better. I don't know how long this will last.
Today is Friday.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
