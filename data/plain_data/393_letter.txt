1. As for the main request that your honor makes, I cannot be of help in any way, and this because of our constitutions. The regulation, sought by me, is that no nun from another order is to be accepted into one of these houses. So many wanted, and want, to enter these houses that even though some were a consolation for us, there are many drawbacks to opening the door to this practice. So I have nothing more to say about this, for the desire I have to please you can do or serve for nothing more than afflict me.
2. Before beginning to found these monasteries, I lived for twenty-five years in one where there were 180 nuns. And because I am in a hurry, I will only say that for anyone who loves God all those things will be a cross for her and of benefit to her soul, and they will not harm it if you keep in mind the advice that you and God alone are in that house, and as long as you do not have an office that obliges you to observe things, don't pay any attention to them, but strive to acquire the virtue that you see in each one, love her for that, benefit from it, and forget about the faults you see in her.
3. The benefit to me was such that even though there were so many nuns it mattered no more than if there were none; they were only an advantage for me. After all, my lady, we can love this great God everywhere. May he be blessed, for there is no one who can prevent us from doing this.
