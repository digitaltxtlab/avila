
To the very illustrious Doña Luisa de la Cerda, my lady.
1. May Jesus be with your ladyship. I have neither time nor energy to write much, for, by myself, I am now writing to only a few persons. I wrote to you a short while ago. I am in a wretched state. When I am with you and in your city my health is better; although the people here do not abhor me, glory to God. But since my desire is to be there, so the body would want to be there also.
2. What do you think about how the Lord arranges things so that I can be at rest? May his name be blessed, for he has wished to work things out through persons who are such servants of God that I think His Majesty will be greatly served through this. For the love of His Majesty you might try to obtain the license. I don't think the administrator should be told that it's for me, but that it is for a house of discalced nuns. And he should be told of the great good they do wherever they are. At least this is true for our nuns in Malagón, glory to God. And you will see that soon you will have this servant of God there with you, for it seems that the Lord does not want us to be separated. May it please His Majesty that we may be together in glory, with all my lords, of whom I ask for prayers. Write and tell me how your health is, for you have been very negligent in doing me this favor. The sisters here kiss your ladyship's hands.
3. You can't imagine how many indulgences and benefits we have obtained through the foundresses of this order. These favors are without number. May the Lord be with you.
Today is the feast of St. Lucy.
Your ladyship's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
