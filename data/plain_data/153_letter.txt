To the very magnificent Señor Luis de Cepeda, my lord, in Torrijos.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, amen. I received your letters and the four ducats. They will be delivered this week. May the Lord reward you for the care you take of our sister at the Incarnation, who is the one most in need. Because of the prioress's illness, Sister Beatriz de Jesús is now in charge of governing the house in Malagón, and she is very busy. She is doing extremely well, glory to God, for I didn't think she was capable of so much.
2. You shouldn't be surprised that you are not able to be very recollected in the midst of so many difficulties. That would be impossible. If you return to your good rule of life when they pass, I will be content. Please God that all goes very well with you, but do not be concerned about having more or having less, for even if a great deal is left for you, everything will soon come to an end. Ask the ladies there to remember me in their prayers; the prioress asks for yours.
Today is 25 November.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
