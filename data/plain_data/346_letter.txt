1. Jesus be with your honor. They were late in telling me about this messenger ... I don't know how you know that you are going to die soon or why you think such foolish thoughts or afflict yourself with what will not come about. Trust in God who is a true friend and will not fail either your children or you. I greatly wish you were in a condition to come here, for I am not able to go there. At least it is very wrong of you not to have visited St. Joseph's in so long a time, for it is close and you wouldn't feel alone. The exercise would do you good. For goodness' sake, don't go on like this, and let me know about your health.
2. I am feeling much better since I've been here, and the small fevers I had have left me. As regards the matter about which I wrote you, I haven't attended to it and won't be able to do anything until after Padre Fray Angel is gone -- and he will be here for eight days.
3. Mother Prioress, Padre Gracián, and San Bartolomé send their best regards, and give mine to Don Francisco.
Let me know about your health, for goodness' sake, and remain with God, for I have no more time.
Today is 19 June.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
4. Perhaps it will be necessary to send you a messenger, for in regard to that matter a step forward has been made which doesn't seem bad. Not until Padre Fray Angel is gone can I do anything.
