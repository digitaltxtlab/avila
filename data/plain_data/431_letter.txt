To my illustrious lord and father Canon Vallejo, my lord.
1. ... Because Padre Fray Pedro de la Purificación, who is delivering this, will give you a long report about everything and since I am not well, I will not say any more than beg you again that in one way or another you arrange matters so that they don't fail to bring the documents, for there is no danger of anything being lost. With the proof that there is an income, we can conclude our business. May the Lord bring this about since it is for his glory, and may he preserve you for many years so that you may always support and favor us.
2. It is very important that you let Señora Doña Beatriz know how much she gains before our Lord and how she loses nothing.
Today is 4 February.
3. My letters and those from our padre that are addressed to Señora Doña Beatriz are left open. Read them (you, Mother Prioress, and Subprioress), and then seal them in order to give them to her. And take great care to keep the secret, for you see how important this is to us ...
