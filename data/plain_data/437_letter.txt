1. Jesus be with your reverence and watch over you for me. You should know that we have now moved into the house and are hurrying to adapt it to our needs. May it be His Majesty's will that everything end well and that we obtain the license to remain there, and that the other stipulations not oblige us to abandon it.
2. Now they are angry with me for having taken possession. I have written again to the bishop to ask him to write a letter of supplication. We will see if it has any effect. You could also, if you think it would help, ask him to do us this favor so that he will write as soon as possible. I don't think I will be able to write to him with this mail, for it is already very late. In any case, I have decided to write to the bishop, as I have said, about the matter I pointed out to you in this letter.
3. As for my health, I am now beginning to feel better, although not completely. I am happy about our house, for it is a very cheerful one. Praise God for having brought this about.
4. I am not writing to Medina because it is already late. Give them my greetings and tell them that I will write on another day. My regards to Mother Subprioress and all the other nuns. Those in this house are doing well, and Teresa goes from good to better, glory to the Lord. She sends her regards to you and to all the nuns, and she always prays to God for you that he will be always with you.
Today is 26 March.
5. I kiss the hands of all those lords and of Canon Reinoso; tell him that I had begun to write to him, but then I didn't have the time.
Teresa of Jesus
