For Mother Prioress at St. Joseph's in Seville.
I was amused by the authority you show with your bell, and if it gets one hopping, as you say, you are right. I hope in God that your house will advance far, for they have suffered much. You say everything so well that if my opinion were followed, they would elect you foundress after my death. And even if I were living I would be eagerly in favor, for you know much more than I do -- and are better; that is the truth. I have the advantage over you through having a little experience. But not much attention should be paid to me any more, for you would be startled to see how old I am and how incapable of anything, etc.
