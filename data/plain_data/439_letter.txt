One sees clearly how different your cares are from mine, and you should know that the reason I didn't send anything is that I couldn't. I was consoled and gave thanks to God that things are going so well for you in the house of Señor Perálvarez, your uncle. Give him my many regards, because I am very grateful for the favor that he and his wife have shown you. I don't have time to write to them now. I'll do so on another day by mail. It's a great favor from God that you have been freed from the pestilence of that woman.
