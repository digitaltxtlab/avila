I tell you that I find here a wonderful leisure that I have desired for many years. Although one's nature feels abandoned without the one who usually provides it with solace, the soul is at rest. And the reason is that there is no more thought of Teresa of Jesus than if she were not in the world. And this will be the cause for my not making any attempt to leave here, unless I am ordered to do so. I was disheartened at times to hear so much foolishness; for when they say there that someone is a saint, it's bound to be nonsense. They laugh because I say they should declare someone else in that place to be one, for it doesn't cost them any more than words.
