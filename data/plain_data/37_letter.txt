1. Jesus. The Holy Spirit be with your honor. The Lord did not want me to enjoy receiving your letter, because the reason for your sending it took away my happiness. May God be blessed for everything.
2. It is evident that the Lord is loved in that house since he is giving it trials in so many ways. When trials are born with such patience as they are there, he is enabled to give more favors. A great favor it is just to begin to understand what little attention should be paid to a life that continually manifests itself as perishable, and to understand how much the life that never ends should be loved and sought. May it please our Lord to give health to Señora Doña Luisa and Señor Don Juan; we are beseeching the Lord for this here.
3. When there is an improvement, I beg you to take away the sorrow that you have now given me. Ask Doña Isabel and Doña Catalina to pray for me. I beseech you to have courage so that you can in turn give it to Señora Doña Luisa. Surely, to stay longer in that place would be to tempt God.
4. May His Majesty guide you and give you all the good I both desire and ask of him for you, amen; and the same goes for Señora Doña Catalina.
Today is 22 October. I received your letter today.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
