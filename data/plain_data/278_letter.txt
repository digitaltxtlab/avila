1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your excellency, amen. They have told me some news here that made me rejoice, that the marriage between Señor Fadrique and Señora María de Toledo has taken place. Understanding what must be your happiness, I have found that all my trials have been thereby softened. Although I cannot be completely sure from the persons who have informed me, there are many indications of the marriage from the rumors going about. I beg you to let me know that my joy may be complete. Please God, this will be for the Lord's great honor and glory, as I hope it will, for we have been praying a long time for this.
2. Here they have informed me of the favor you are showing us all. I tell you that it is so great ...
3. If you favor us in this regard it would be like liberating us from the captivity of Egypt. They have told me that you have given orders to Padre Maestro Fray Pedro Fernández to attend to this affair. It is the best thing that could happen to us, for he knows those on each side. It seems like an idea from heaven. May our Lord be pleased to guard you as a help for the poor and the afflicted.
4. I kiss your hands many times for so great a grace and gift and I beg you to do me the favor of urging with insistence and much ardor that Padre Fray Pedro Fernández go to the court. Consider this to be a matter that concerns the Blessed Virgin, our Lady, who now needs to be protected by persons like him in this war waged by the devil against her order, for many men and women will not enter if they think they will have to be subject to those persons now being imposed on us.
5. We have been much more comforted ever since our fathers have been governing us, and so I hope in our Lord that everything will turn out well.
6. May it please His Majesty to preserve you for us for many years with the holiness I beg of him, amen.
