As I say, then, this love is recognized when it is present, just as the love between a man and woman cannot be concealed; the more it is hidden the more it seems to reveal itself. However, since the love is for nothing but a worm, it doesn't even deserve the name 'love'; for it is founded on nothing -- it's disgusting to make this comparison. And could one conceal a love so strong as is love of God, founded on such cement, having so much to love and so many reasons for loving? In sum, it is love and merits the name 'love,' for where it is present the vanities of the world must be shunned.
