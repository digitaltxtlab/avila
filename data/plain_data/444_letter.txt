For Sister Leonor de la Misericordia, Soria.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your charity, my daughter. Although it is night and the clock will be striking one while I am writing this, I did not want to miss sending you this letter. I have been wanting to find a mail carrier for Soria and have written for one, but I don't know what happened to my letters, and they don't take much care there about writing to me. Now the one who is bringing this to you is someone who will be able to give you an account of what is going on here. And I would like you to give an account of what is going on with you to this father of your soul in all openness and let yourself find consolation in his words, for he knows how to bring relief in every way. I am delighted that you will get to know him.
2. Because the lad he is bringing with him must return, let me know, for goodness' sake, how you are, whether you are happy and about everything else -- I pray much for you -- and tell me what Señor Don Francés has done, for they have told me that he still hasn't decided against marrying, which has surprised me very much; I want him to succeed in serving our Lord.
3. Señora Doña María de Beamonte has been sick for some days. Write to her and to Doña Juana. Thank her for the favor they have done us. And remain with God, for the head can do no more. Give Padre Vallejo a warm greeting for me and ask him to tell our padre about anything that might need correction in that house.
Your reverence's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
4. You can speak to our padre about Pamplona. The Lord will guide everything if it is to be for his service. But if we would have to build from the beginning, I don't think it would be suitable.
