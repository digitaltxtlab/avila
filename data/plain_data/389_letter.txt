1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I received your letter and spoke with Canon Salinas about the house you say belongs to Don Luis Osorio. And he says that it is located in a place where there is a lot of noise from the street and surrounded on all sides by vulgar people. If you have leased it, I have nothing more to say, and all we can do, as you state, is move in there. But if you have not, wait and don't take it until you see whether we can find another house in a neighborhood more suited to our way of life, especially if the houses of Francisco de Burgos or Agustín de Torquemada on the Calle de la Puebla, or others like them, are available; that would be great.
2. Because I am writing this in the speak room in the presence of Canon Salinas, I'll say no more than that the St. Joseph will not be made now until we see what will happen here. These sisters will finish this letter.
Today is the vigil of St. Mark.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
I kiss the hands of Señora Catalina de Tolosa.
