For my dear daughter Sister Teresa de Jesús.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your charity, my daughter. I was delighted with your letter, and that my letters make you happy is a great joy for me, seeing that we cannot be together.
2. As for the dryness, it seems to me that the Lord is now treating you as one who is strong. He wants to try you in order to know the love you have for him, whether it is present in dryness as well as in spiritual delights. Take it as a very great favor from God. Don't let it cause you any grief, for perfection does not consist in delight but in the virtues. When you least expect, devotion will return.
3. As for what you say about that sister, try not to think of it, but turn away from the thought. And don't think that when a thought comes into your mind, even if it concerns something very bad, you are immediately at fault, for the thought is nothing. I too would like to see that sister experience the same dryness, for I don't know if she understands herself, and for her own good we could desire this. When some bad thought comes to you, bless yourself, or recite an Our Father, or strike your breast and try to think of something else, and you will instead be meriting because you will be resisting.
4. I would like to answer Isabel de San Pablo, but there is not time. Give her my best regards -- for she already knows how you must be the one dearest to me -- and also regards to Romero and María de San Jerónimo. I wish someone would write to me about her health, since she doesn't do so. Don Francisco is like an angel and doing well. Yesterday he received communion, and his servants did so too. Tomorrow we are going to Valladolid. He will write to you from there, for I haven't told him now about this messenger.
May God watch over you, my daughter, and make you as holy as I beg of him, amen. My regards to all.
Today is the feast of San Alberto.
