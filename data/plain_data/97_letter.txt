1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor, amen. May God be blessed that you are in good health and the whole household as well. I greatly desire that Señor Alonso Alvarez's health will be restored, for indeed I love him tenderly in the Lord. I am praying for him and telling the sisters to do so as well, and we are also praying for you.
2. I kiss his honor's hands, and he may count this letter as also for him and know that wherever I am he has in me a true servant. And I beg you to tell the same to Señora Doña Francisca Ramírez. Since I receive word of all of you from Mother Prioress, I have neglected to write. And, indeed, I often have so much to do that I am not able to write. Here my health has been good, glory to God. As for the rest, I am happier when up there among Castilians; with these people down here, I don't feel comfortable.
3. I spoke to our Father Provincial about the matter you entrusted to me. He says that it would be necessary for him to be there and that since his brother has been very sick in bed for many days it isn't possible for him to do anything. I have discussed it here with others, but it seems doubtful that anything could be achieved. So, if there is a tribunal up there and you would stand to lose by any delay, do not hesitate to have recourse to it. In my own business affairs I have little luck in Madrid, even though we do all we can. May the Lord be pleased to do what he sees is necessary, for I see how important this is for us. What a hardship that with all the other trials your honors have in this affair, another one should come along.
May His Majesty watch over you and guide you by the hand, amen; and the same to Señor Alonso Alvarez.
Today is the 26th.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
