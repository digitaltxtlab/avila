1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. Today my sister, her husband, and children arrived to see my brother Lorenzo. He had just departed for Madrid, although he left his children here and will return this winter. Afterward he will go directly to Avila. He arrived very weakened and sick; he is better now. We spoke much about your honor. Agustín remained over there.
2. Sister Beatriz de Jesús has become so fond of the prioress in Malagón that she has begged me not to transfer her, but the prioress has had bad health. May God be pleased to give her good health, for all the nuns are happy with her and with her disposition. I am not so happy with Señor Luis de Cepeda, for it would be good if at times he sent me word of himself. I received a letter from Isabel de San Pablo today. May God make them his servants, and may he preserve you for many years. I have had better health here than up there. My best regards to all the ladies there.
Today is 24 October.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
