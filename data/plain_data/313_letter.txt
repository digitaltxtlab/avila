1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I did not think I would be able to write to you, and since Mother Prioress has written, I will say no more here than that Padre Nicolao is very set on your not entering anywhere else than in the monastery that with the Lord's favor will be founded in Madrid. We hope in His Majesty that this will come about soon. If you have the patience to wait a little longer after having already waited so long, no one must know of your plan or that a foundation will be made there. This is very important.
2. The nuns in the monastery of Salamanca have already agreed to accept you. I say this because if there is some doubt over the other new foundation, you can be certain of being received in Salamanca. But for some reason it seems to Padre Nicolao that it is more fitting for God's service that you help that foundation, and the aim of all of us is nothing else than the service of God. Padre Nicolao will soon be coming from Seville; in the meantime consider what will be more satisfying to you. May His Majesty guide things to your desired goal and make use of your soul for what renders him the most honor and glory, amen.
3. It consoled me very much to see the great happiness of your sister, and ours, Encarnación. If you are as good, we will be happy. Certainly she is an angel. She has rejoiced to be with me.
Today is 19 November.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
