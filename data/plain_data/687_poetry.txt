30. For a Profession
 
Since our Spouse
Wants us in prison,
Let us glory,
Glory in religion.
 
Oh what a splendid wedding
Jesus arranged!
All of us He loves
And gives us His light.
The cross let us follow
With perfection great.
Let us glory,
Glory in religion.
 
This is our state
God chose for us,
From sinful ways
He has protected us,
He has promised us
Consolation great
If in this prison
We rejoice.
Let us glory,
Glory in religion.
 
Greatness He will give us
In glory everlasting
If for His riches
We give up the dross
Found in this world
With all its ruin.
Let us glory,
Glory in religion.
 
Oh what captivity
Of such great liberty!
Life so fortunate
For time unending.
I desire not to free
My heart now.
Let us glory,
Glory in religion.
