For mi padre, confessor of the Carmelite nuns. He is mi padre. Alba.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be always with your honor, mi padre. Your letter consoled me greatly. May God watch over you, for with respect to what you are doing, the house will not suffer any loss. You offer many excuses for them, and it doesn't seem bad to me that in everything you carry out your office as father. You are much indebted to the Sisters, who tell me so many things about you. After all, they are good souls, and even though the devil finds ways to disturb them, God does not cease to guide them. May his name be blessed, for at all times he shows mercy toward his creatures.
2. You have shown me great favor by removing the burden which that house was for me. Since you are their confessor, what you say is more satisfying than everything else. Please God, I will go there soon, and we can have a long talk. Pray for me. I don't have much time and many business matters have arisen here.
3. Give my regards to Señora Teresa de Layz, for I don't think I will have a chance to write to her. You can tell her that I was delighted to receive her letter and that, God willing, all will be well. May God give you his grace.
Valladolid, the fifth of September,
