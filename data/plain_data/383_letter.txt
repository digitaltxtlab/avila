1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your lordship. Although I have desired to write you a long letter, I have not been fortunate enough to find the time, even though the gentleman who brought your letter and came one day to see me did not fail to remind me. You favor me in every way. I have written you by a different route and believe you will by now have received the letter. At present there is nothing new except a further complication about a house which makes me fear I will have to stay here this summer.
2. Regarding the matter you wrote me about, even though it seems good for all of us, I don't know if I want to see you in the midst of the trials that accompany these things, which are terrible. Entrust it all to the Lord; His Majesty will guide you.
3. I am well; and it seems our affairs are going well. Please God, you will be well always. I am being so pressed to hurry that I cannot say more.
Today is Tuesday of Holy Week.
Your unworthy servant and subject,
Teresa of Jesus
