1. Once the Lord granted me light on a matter it pleased me to know about. Soon afterward I forgot, for I couldn't again remember what it was. And while trying to recall it I heard this: "You already know I sometimes speak to you; don't neglect to write down what I say; for even though it may not benefit you, it can benefit others." I was wondering whether I was to be helpful to others but on account of my sins be lost myself. He said to me: "Have no fear."
