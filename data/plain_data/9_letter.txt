1. Jesus be with your ladyship. I arrived here in Avila very tired on the Wednesday before Pentecost, for, as I wrote to you, I was in such a dreadful state of health that I wasn't ready for traveling. And so we journeyed at a slow pace. The priest accompanying us was a great comfort to me; he's so gracious about everything. A relative of mine is passing through; as a child, he suffered from stone and was cured by the waters of the spring down there and has never suffered a relapse. This good news made me so happy, because I hope in our Lord the same thing will happen to Señor Don Juan. May His Majesty heal him, which is what we here are begging him to do. I kiss his honor's hands and those of all my lords.
2. I've found out that Doña Teresa, the daughter of the Marchioness of Velada has become a nun and is very happy. I visited the Marchioness of Vellena last Sunday. She was most gracious, but since my Señora Doña Luisa is all I need, the courtesy mattered little to me. May the Lord bring you here to me safely and in good health. In regard to what I entrusted with you, I beg you once more, for reasons about which I've already written you, not to neglect it, for it is a very important matter for me. Since I left a long letter in Malagón for you and another in Toledo, this one is for no other purpose than to let you know that I arrived safely, and so I've nothing further to say.
Today is Wednesday.
Your ladyship's unworthy subject and servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
