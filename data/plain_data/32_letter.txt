To the magnificent Señor Diego Ortiz, my lord.
1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be ever in your soul and repay you for the charity and favor you have shown me with your letter. You would not be losing time if you wrote me many, for this could help to spur us on in the service of the Lord. His Majesty knows that I would rather be down there, and so I'm in a great hurry to purchase a house here. It's a weighty burden, although there are many for sale and at a low price. So I hope in the Lord this matter will be settled soon. My haste is equal to the joy that will be mine in seeing Señor Alonso Ramírez. I kiss his honor's hands and those of Señora Doña Francisca Ramírez.
2. Surely your honors must find great joy in your church, for I share in your happiness through the good news I receive. May our Lord allow you to enjoy many years with as much dedication to his service as I beg of him. Allow His Majesty to work and do not be in such a hurry to see everything done, for he has already granted us a great favor in what has been accomplished in just two years.
3. I don't understand what has been written to me about the controversy with the curate and chaplains -- at Santa Justa I suppose. I beg you to let me know what this is all about.
4. I am not writing to his honor Señor Alonso Ramírez; there's no reason for tiring him, since I'm writing to you. Because I am not able to serve your honors in the way I ought, I beg the Lord to repay and to preserve you for many years and to make those angels very holy -- especially my patron -- for we are in great need of this; and may he always keep you in his care, amen.
Today is 29 March.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus, Carmelite
