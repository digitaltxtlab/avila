1. Jesus be with your reverence. Oh, how I would like to make this a long letter! For your letter brought me great joy. But I was bled yesterday and they've ordered me to be bled again today. This has hindered me from writing. I didn't think the mail carrier was going to leave so soon, and he is rushing me. The bloodletting has restored life to my head. I will soon be well, if God so wills.
2. What made me so happy is that you are going to live with the friars, since you have to stay in Madrid. But be careful, padre, for they will weigh all your words. For love of God, be cautious and not so candid. I truly believe what they say about Tostado, for if he is prudent he will not come until he receives the consent of the one you mention. Thus, he wants to obtain it with your help. I've never seen anything so charming. Now I have received the letters that you told me you had sent, and yesterday that one from our padre.
3. As regards Padre Fray Baltasar, certainly I have written to him, and more than once. As long as you live with the friars, you will be doing very well to stay in Madrid. Continue to please the nuncio as you are now doing, for after all he is our superior, and everyone appreciates obedience.
There's no more time.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
