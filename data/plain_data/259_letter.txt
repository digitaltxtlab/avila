To the very magnificent Señor Roque de Huerta, chief forest guard of his majesty.
1. ... Don't worry about anything; the Lord will provide when you least expect. My worry now, the greatest I've had, is whether our padre has fallen into the nuncio's hands. I would much rather see him in the hands of God and amid the dangers of travel to Rome, even if worse, and among those friars chosen to go. Perhaps I don't know what I am talking about.
2. For goodness' sake let me know what is happening as soon as possible, for we are all troubled over this. And how is Padre Fray Antonio, for I have been very distressed in his regard. Those were heavy blows to take by one who was so ill and weak. He is a saint, and God is treating him as one.
3. Great was the consolation I derived from the count's letter, for it seems to me God has chosen him as a means to help us. I am answering with the enclosed letter. It is a most important letter, and I wouldn't want any mishap to come to it. If his lordship is there, you can give it to him yourself. Otherwise, send it to him through a private messenger. And note how important it is, for it not to be lost.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
