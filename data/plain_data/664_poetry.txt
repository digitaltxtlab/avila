7. Sighs in Exile
 
My God, how sad is
Life without You!
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
This earth's journey
How long it is;
A painful dwelling,
An exile drear.
Oh, Master adored,
Take me away!
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
Dismal is life,
Bitter as can be:
The soul lifeless,
Apart from You.
O my sweet Goodness,
How sad am I!
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
O kind death
Free me from trials!
Gentle are your blows,
Freeing the soul.
Oh, my Beloved, what joy
To be oned to You!
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
To this life
Worldly love adheres;
Love divine
For the other sighs.
Eternal God, without You,
Who can live?
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
Unending sorrow
Is this earthly life;
Life that is true
In heaven alone is found.
My God, allow
That there I may dwell.
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
Who fears
The body's death
If one then gains
Pleasure so great?
Oh, yes, in loving You,
Forever, my God!
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
Afflicted, my soul
Sighs and faints.
Ah, who can stay apart
From her Beloved?
Oh! end now,
This my suffering.
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
The fish caught
On the painful hook,
In death's embrace
Its torment ending.
Ah, how I suffer,
Without You, my Love.
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
Master, my soul
In vain seeks You!
Always unseen
You leave me anxiously longing.
Ah! the very longing inflames
Until I cry out:
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
When at last
You enter my heart,
My God, then at once
I fear your leaving.
The pain that touches me
Makes me say,
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
Lord, end now
This long agony.
Comfort your servant
Sighing for You.
Shatter the fetters
Let her rejoice.
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
 
Ah, no, Beloved Master,
It is only that I suffer
My sins to atone
My guilt unbounded
Ah! may my tears gain
Your listening to me:
Longing to see You,
Death I desire.
