It grieved me deeply to learn of what Fray John had to suffer and that they are allowing him, as sick as he is, to go down there right away. Please God he doesn't die on us. Be sure, as a favor to me, that they take good care of him in Almodóvar and that he doesn't go any further. Don't fail to give the necessary orders. And be careful not to forget. I tell you that you would have few like him left, if he were to die.
