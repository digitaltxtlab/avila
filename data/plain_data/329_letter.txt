For my sister, María de Jesús, Carmelite.
1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your charity, my daughter. If you had my headache and so many business matters to deal with, you would be excused for not having written me in so long a time. But since you are without these, I don't know why you leave me to complain about you and my dear Sister Catalina de Jesús. Well, certainly you ought not to do this! If I could, I would be writing to you so frequently that I wouldn't allow you to sleep in forgetting me so much. It is a comfort to me to know that you are in good health and happy and that, according to what they say, serving our Lord.
2. May it please His Majesty that this be so, for I beg it of him. In the thought of that house I would now like to find comfort after the many tiresome problems and trials of such diverse kinds that I have gone through in these past years. This desire corresponds to my sensual nature. But when reason returns, I see well that I do not deserve anything but the cross and more of the cross and that God is doing me a great favor in not giving me anything else.
3. Your Mother Prioress will have already told you how they are ordering me to go to a place to make a foundation there, something I have been resisting for years. Well they have persevered so long -- and it seems a good thing to our superior -- that I am now going, very confident that it will be of service to our Lord. Will you ask this of him and that he will always allow me to do his will.
4. Give my regards to Sisters Catalina de Jesús, Isabel de Jesús, and Leonor del Salvador. I wish I had the time and head to go on at greater length. Do not be brief in writing to me or surprised if I do not answer at once. Be assured that I am delighted with your letters and that I do not forget to recommend you to our Lord.
May His Majesty make you as holy as I desire.
Your charity's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
