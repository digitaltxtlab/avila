	I was astonished and very angered by the letters from Alcalá, especially by the one you wrote. Oh, good God, how true it is that we do not know ourselves! Well, I tell you, as I have written you before, that after what has been done I am so afraid that I wish you weren't there, and I think this will come about. Would to God you were back with the cats! The threat is a good one.
