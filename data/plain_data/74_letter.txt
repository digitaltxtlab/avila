1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I assure you that your letter delighted me; it seems you wrote it for no other purpose. May God reward you for the goodness you have shown me through it and by all that you say. As for the rest, these days I have not even been thinking of myself, much less of food. When I have a free moment, I tell you, I grow more concerned than when I was there. I don't know how you can say that I inspired courage, for it was you who gave courage to all of us, and so I beg you to continue doing so.
2. It made me very sorry to learn that they are beginning to use the bread. The proceeds from its sale would have provided me with my only collateral. I fear lest we lose on the one hand what we gain on the other. I have already given orders that they buy bread; that should be possible through what accrues from the sale. I am looking around here to see if I can scrape something together for my return. In sum, I hope in the Lord that we will not want. So, would you continue helping us in your usual way? I will serve you by praying to the Lord for you; please do the same for me. I am well and have so many letters to write that I can't say more.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
3. Out of charity would you visit Francisco de Salcedo for me, and tell him I have been distressed over his illness but was delighted to learn from this messenger that he is not bothered at all by the litigation. After I wrote to him, they told me that he was taking it very hard, and this grieved me. He must not have received my letter. Be very careful about letters sent to the little villages; such care is necessary.
