1. Jesus. May the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I am sending money to Avila so that they may send this messenger to you, for these enclosed letters will bring you much happiness. I was overjoyed by them, and I hope in the Lord that my brother's arrival will bring you some relief -- a great deal -- from your trials. So many holy intentions cannot help but bring about much good, and I would rather see him and his family live peacefully in their own home than that they have the endowment of these other offices, for I see flaws in each of them. May the Lord be blessed who has so directed matters. I repeat that I am especially happy for Señor Juan de Ovalle and you. In sum, my letters must have been good for something, but yours have been of little help.
2. I wrote to Gonzalito through the inquisitor Soto. I still don't know whether the letter was delivered to him; I have received no news of him. Do you see now what God is working in Lorenzo de Cepeda? He seems to be looking more to his children's salvation than to amassing a fortune. O Jesus, how much I owe you -- everywhere that I look -- and how little I serve you! No happiness for me is greater than to see my brothers, whom I love so much, receive the light to desire what is best. Didn't I tell you to leave it all in the Lord's hands, that he would take care of it? So I advise you again to place your affairs in his hands, for in everything His Majesty will do what most suits us.
3. I'm writing no more for now because I've written a great deal today, and it is late. Indeed, I am happy in thinking about the joy you will have. May the Lord give us joys where they will last, for all those of this life are suspect. I am well and am in a hurry to buy the house; things are moving along. Regards to Beatriz.
Today is the nineteenth of October.
Yours,
Teresa of Jesus
