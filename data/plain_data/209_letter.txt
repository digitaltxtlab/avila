To the very magnificent Señor Roque de Huerta, chief forest guard of his majesty, Madrid.
1. Jesus be with your honor always. Since these letters are of the greatest importance they are being sent with a much higher portage. I beg you to have them sent with the usual caution and quickly. If you cannot find a safe and trustworthy person, engage a private messenger and our padre will pay for it.
2. There are two packs of letters, for we had already sent one when another business matter arose, and this mail carrier would in no way let us add the later ones to the earlier ones, so it was necessary to make another pack. May the Lord guide them as the need requires, and may he watch over you for his greater service.
Written on 7 October.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
3. Let me know, for the love of the Lord, if there is anything new about the business matters, and pay a good portage.
4. It is very important that both packs of letters be delivered together to our padre and with all possible haste, as I have said.
