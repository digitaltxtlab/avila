Don't let anyone frighten you with these fears. Praise God, for He is all powerful and will not let them take mental prayer away from you. On the contrary, anyone who cannot pray vocally with this attention should realize that he isn't fulfilling his obligation. He must strive for this attention with every effort -- if he wants to pray with perfection -- under pain of not doing what is required of the bride of so great a King. Beg Him, daughters, to give me the grace to do what I am counseling you to do, for I fail very much in this matter. May His Majesty provide because of who He is.
