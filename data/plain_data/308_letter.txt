1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor always, amen. I received your letter, and the good news you gave me about his majesty's favorable response was a great consolation. May God preserve him for us many years, and all those counselors of his.
2. You should know that when your letter arrived in which you told me that Señora Doña María from Montoya was here, she had already left for Madrid. I greatly regretted not having known this before, for I had very much wanted to see her.
3. Let me know what you have done with the money you advanced, for I am worried about this. May it please our Lord that everything turn out as well as you desire.
4. The messenger consoled me with news of our travelers, about whom I was very worried. Blessed be God who preserved them from so many dangers and brought them to safe harbor.
5. Your honor should know that although Padre Fray Nicolao keeps me informed about the negotiations, I am also happy that you do, for even though what gives so much joy is heard many times, one never tires of it. May it please our Lord that we soon see the desired end, and may he give you his holy grace.
It is 26 July.
Your honor's servant,
Teresa of Jesus
