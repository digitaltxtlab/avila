1. Jesus be with your honor. I received your letter; the favor you do me by writing gave me great joy. These letters that the messenger is carrying are addressed to my brother. I told the messenger that if my brother is not there to turn to you. And so I ask you to open the packet that goes to my brother, take out a letter addressed to our Padre Maestro Gracián, and find out where he is, either in Toledo or Alcalá -- I think he will be in Alcalá. And send this messenger to the place where he is, for the matter is important and is the reason I am sending this messenger.
2. For love of God, hurry to send him on his way, for as I say the matter is important and he must be in either Toledo or Alcalá.
3. Since I had no other purpose in writing, there is no more to say than may God be with your honor and watch over you.
Yesterday was the feast of the Magdalene.
Your unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
