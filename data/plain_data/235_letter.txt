1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. God was pleased that it wasn't my right arm that suffered the damage, and so I can write this. I am better, glory to God, and I can keep the Lenten observance. The gifts you are always giving me will help me do so. May our Lord repay you. Although you do this for me, Sister Isabel de San Pablo is so tempted to love me that she is happier than I about it. It is a great consolation for me to be in her company, which seems like that of an angel. It is a consolation as well to know that your health is good, as is also that of those ladies, whose hands I kiss many times. I often pray to our Lord for them and do the same for you.
2. I was most distressed to hear of the death of that lady. Not long ago I wrote to Señor Don Teutonio, in response to one of his letters, to congratulate him on the happy occasion of the wedding, for I owe him much. These people undergo great trials. It seems clear they are servants of God, since trials are the greatest gift God can give us in life. If this life that is so short serves for any good, it is to gain eternal life.
3. I praise our Lord that you are not careless about this truth. So I beg him that this may be always the case and also for those ladies. Lorenzo de Cepeda kisses their hands many times as well as yours.
Your honor's unworthy servant,
Teresa of Jesus
