My daughter: I am very sorry about Sister Isabel's sickness. I am sending you the saintly Fray John of the Cross, for God has given him the grace to cast out devils from persons having them. Just recently here in Avila he has driven out three legions of devils from a person, demanding that they identify themselves, and they obeyed at once. What they fear in him is so much grace accompanied by so much humility.
