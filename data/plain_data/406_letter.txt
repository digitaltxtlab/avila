1. Jesus. The grace of the Holy Spirit be with your honor. I am now in Avila, mi padre, where I would most willingly be your daughter again if you were here, for I feel very much alone in this city where I find no one who can console me in my present situation. May God provide a remedy. The more I go on, the less I find in this life that can provide consolation.
2. I was not well when I arrived here, but had a slight fever caused by a certain circumstance. Now I am well, and it seems the body is relieved for not having to go on another trip so soon. For I tell you, these trips are very tiring, although I can't say that about the one from here to Soria. That trip was recreation for me, it being a smooth journey, often with a view of rivers that provided pleasant company. Our good procurator will have told you about this experience.
3. It's a strange thing that not one of those who desire to do me a favor escapes without a good deal of trouble, but God gives them the charity to enjoy it, as he has done with you. See that you do not fail to write me a letter when you have a messenger, even though you may find it tiring to do so, for I tell you there is very little in which to find rest, and many trials.
4. I am delighted that Dionisia has entered. I beg you to tell the chief mail carrier and give him my regards, and don't forget to pray for me. Since I arrived only a short time ago, there is no lack of visitors and so little opportunity to relax by writing to you.
5. I kiss Don Francisco's hands. May our Lord watch over you with an increase in holiness, as I beg of him, amen.
Today is 9 September.
Your honor's unworthy servant and daughter,
Teresa of Jesus
